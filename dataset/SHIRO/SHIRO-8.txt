Summary:
After logout() a getSubject() call still honors remember me
Description:
This cropped up for me because Spring's FrameworkServlet calls request.getUserName() by default, which under the hood will call JSecurity's getSubject(). This causes a new subject to be created that honors the remember me cookie. Instead - this new subject should be created without a remember me cookie being honored.
One way we could work around this problem is by setting a request attribute when you logout that tells the RememberMeManager that it shouldn't honor the remember me cookie for the remainder of this request.
