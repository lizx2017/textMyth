Summary:
On Successful Login Shiro adds two response header values for the same remember-me cookie name.
Description:
On successful login, shiro adds two cookie entries one with deleteMe as value and other with the encrypted value.
Though delete-me value cookie has expired state, it should not be resent in the header. As per the cookie spec, order of the response headers should not be relied upon.
class : AbstractRememberMeManager
method :
public void onSuccessfulLogin(Subject subject, AuthenticationToken token, AuthenticationInfo info)
{ //always clear any previous identity: forgetIdentity(subject); //now save the new identity: if (isRememberMe(token)) { rememberIdentity(subject, token, info); }
else
{ if (log.isDebugEnabled()) { log.debug("AuthenticationToken did not indicate RememberMe is requested. " + "RememberMe functionality will not be executed for corresponding account."); }
}
}
In the above code, forget identity happens every time. Better place is in the else condition(when isNotRememberMe).
