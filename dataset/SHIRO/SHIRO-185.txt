Summary:
Shiro Annotations in Spring apps: annotations on method implementations not handled when using Spring's DefaultAutoProxyCreator
Description:
When using Spring's DefaultAutoProxyCreator mechanism to enable Shiro security checks via annotations (@RequiresAuthentication, @RequiresPermissions, etc), Shiro annotations on Interface methods are the only ones that are processed successfully. If a method implementatin is annotated directly, the authorization interceptor is never triggered during a method call.
