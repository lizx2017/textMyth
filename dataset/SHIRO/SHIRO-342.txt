Summary:
Running the example as described at http://shiro.apache.org/10-minute-tutorial.html fails
Description:
I was not able to execute the maven commands because the environment from the zip file is not a valid svn working directory. I had to modify the pom to give it a revision number before maven was happy. I found the info at http://mojo.codehaus.org/buildnumber-maven-plugin/faq.html.
