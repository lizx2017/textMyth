Summary:
permissionsLookupEnabled flag never used in jdbcRealm
Description:
JdbcRealm class supports the permissionsLookupEnabled flag, but during the doGetAuthorizationInfo call the permissions are always read regardless of the value of this variable.
A change like this could fix it @line 277 in JdbcRealm.java:
if (permissionsLookupEnabled)
{ permissions = getPermissions(conn, username, roleNames); }
