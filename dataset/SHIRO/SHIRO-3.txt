Summary:
SimpleAccountRealm fails with NPE
Description:
Testing a simple example based on the Quickstart.java, using DefaultSecurityManager and PropertiesRealm with default user properties would successfully login users listed in the properties file, but fails with NPE on invalid usernames.
I get NPE from SimpleAccountRealm.doGetAuthenticationInfo(AuthenticationToken token) method at this location:
if (account.isLocked())
{ throw new LockedAccountException("Account [" + account + "] is locked."); }
The variable account is null - as so it should be since it is not in the authorizationCache. I was testing for the behaviour when unknown users are trying to login.
Seemingly a null test and return null would fix this issue, as the caller AuthenticationRealm.getAuthenticationInfo(AuthenticationToken token) handles null return values.
