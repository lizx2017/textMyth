Summary:
PortFilter not accepting custom port
Description:
The following shiro.ini code no worky. Tomcat running on port 8080, with SSL running on 8443.
[main]
ssl.port = 8443

[urls]
/admin/** = ssl
Access to http://host:8080/admin/foo redirects to https://host:8080/admin/foo, not https://host:8443/admin/foo.
(It looks to me like PortFilter.onAccessDenied() appends the request.getServerPort() instead of the port. If I now read this correctly [might not, this is my first foray into Shiro source], it appears that you can only have SSL on 443 or 80, or else it must be on the same port as the request itself )
As far as I can tell, this occurs in all versions up until the current trunk.
