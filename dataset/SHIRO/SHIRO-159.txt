Summary:
ThreadLocal is not cleared upon the unloading of the webapp and the SHiro Servlet
Description:
Tomcat 6.0.26 reports a severe error when unloading a web app that uses org.apache.shiro.web.servlet.IniShiroFilter
SEVERE: A web application created a ThreadLocal with key of type [null] (value [org.apache.shiro.util.ThreadContext$1@c0c66a]) and a value of type [java.util.HashMap] (value [{}]) but failed to remove it when the web application was stopped. To prevent a memory leak, the ThreadLocal has been forcibly removed.
