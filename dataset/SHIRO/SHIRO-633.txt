Summary:
Remove HttpSession attributes when invalidated
Description:
When calling logout the HttpSession does not remove the attributes added throughout the session. This results in the HttpSession not being valid after the logout longer valid and the RAP application to wait forever, due to the HttpSessionBindingListener not being called.
The problem can be found in the RAP forum
Apache tomcat invalidate states that it should Invalidate the session and then unbind any objects bound to it.
