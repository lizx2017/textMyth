Summary:
pom specified incorrect package versions for guice
Description:
The maven bundle plugin will auto fill the package versions of the referenced packages. So I removed the version specified and verified with a build that the correct 1.3 (can you please consider upgrading to Guice 4.0 (1.4)) version appears in the bundle manifest.
I would love if you could push out a quick 1.2.5 with this change. My OSGi deployments are currently blocked by this.
