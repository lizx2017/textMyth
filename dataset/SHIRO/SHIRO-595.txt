Summary:
Allow for POST only logout requests
Description:
See:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3521290/logout-get-or-post
A logout causes a change of state, so should NOT be a GET.
Also, due to browser pre-fetching, a typing http://localhost:8080/log may cause a prefetch to /logout
To stay backwards compatible, this need to be an op-in feature.
The proposed solution set a shiro.postOnlyLogout = true attribute, (same as logout.postOnlyLogout = true)
