Summary:
shiro-core has an undesirable runtime OSGi dependency to spring-beans
Description:
The manifest.mf of the shiro-core jar has a runtime dependency on org.apache.commons.configuration2.interpol,
The org.apache.commons.configuration2.interpol package is provided by
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.apache.commons</groupId>
            <artifactId>commons-configuration2</artifactId>
            <version>2.1</version>
            <scope>compile</scope>
        </dependency>
and this bundle (it is a bundle with an OSGi MANIFEST.MF) has springframework package requirements in the Import-Package header:
org.springframework.beans.factory,
org.springframework.core.env,
org.springframework.core.io,
org.springframework.util
It should be possible to fix this by bumping the config-configurations2 dependency to to 2.2, for in that version of the bundle, the springframework packages are made optional (and the runtime requirement goes away).
