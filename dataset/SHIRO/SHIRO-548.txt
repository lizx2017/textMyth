Summary:
DelegatingSubject cannot be serialized
Description:
Dear Les:
I have encountered this problem when tried to serialize the Subject object in my application.I am developing an distributed application,and the Subject will generate at the Provider end,then I restore it in redis and in Consumer end find it use sessionId.
but when debugging I get an Exception says DelegatingSubject cannot be serialized...I have tried to decrease the version of Shiro to 1.0.0-incubating,whose Subject had implemented the Java.io.Serizlizable interface so that can be serialized.But I find its contents seems not complete in redis server,can you give me some advices,I will very appreciate it
