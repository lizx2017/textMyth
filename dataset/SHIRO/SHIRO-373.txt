Summary:
Complete CAS remember-me support
Description:
I was preparing a demo on CAS support for Shiro : https://github.com/leleuj/cas-shiro-demo and I did realize the remember-me feature is not fully addressed.
One use case is missing : if the user is already remembered (by CAS) and want to be authenticated, it should be redirected to CAS server with a specific parameter (renew=true) to force CAS re-authentication.
For this use case, I created a CasAuthenticatedUserFilter which checks if the user is authenticated (not remembered) and sends him to the CAS server if he's not (with the specific parameter to force re-authentication if he's already remembered).
