Summary:
HostAuthenticationToken does not extend AuthenticationToken
Description:
The HostAuthenticationToken interface by name has a strong relationship with AuthenticationToken. However, it does not extend that interface. By contrast, RememberMeAuthenticationToken does extend AuthenticationToken. This seems like an oversight in this interface's definition.
Note: I realize this is very trivial; I'm just opening this issue to track that this may need to be changed.
