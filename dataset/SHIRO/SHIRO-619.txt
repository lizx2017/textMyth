Summary:
Used Limited access BeanUtilsBean
Description:
This issue stems from https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO-576.
In my humble opinion, it is not enough just to set the version of commons-beanutils to 1.9.2 or to 1.9.3 in order to fix CVE-2014-0114 vulnerability because mentioned versions DO NOT fix it by default. In contrast, the fix should be applied explicitly by beanutils-consuming applications (see INTRODUCTION section in http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-beanutils/javadocs/v1.9.2/RELEASE-NOTES.txt).
So, if Shiro uses BeanUtilsBean somehow and is vulnerable to mentioned CVE, it would be worth to configure BeanUtilsBean as it is recommended in beanutils' release notes.
