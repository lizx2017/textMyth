Summary:
shiro-faces principal tag is not rendered when used inside h:panelGroup component
Description:
When using the shiro-faces principal tag inside a h:panelGroup, nothing will be rendered. This is because the "encodeAll" method is never called. I changed the overriding method to encodeEnd which is called.
Attached is a patch containing the respective change.
