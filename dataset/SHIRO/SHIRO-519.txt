Summary:
ThreadContext.setResources() doesn't handle empty maps correctly
Description:
ThreadLocal.setResources() doesn't handle the case where resources is want to be cleared.
This could be used in situation when session is switched temporary to another thread.
One could do:
old = ThreadContext.getResources();
ThreadContext.setResources(new);
// do the magic
ThreadContext.setResources(old);
If the old resources was empty it will leave new resources in place.
Fix would be trivial:
    public static void setResources(Map<Object, Object> newResources) {
        if (CollectionUtils.isEmpty(newResources)) {
            return;
        }
        resources.get().clear();
        resources.get().putAll(newResources);
    }
->
    public static void setResources(Map<Object, Object> newResources) {
        resources.get().clear();
        if (CollectionUtils.isEmpty(newResources)) {
            return;
        }
        resources.get().putAll(newResources);
    }
