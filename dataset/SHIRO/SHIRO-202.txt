Summary:
Shiro Tags are not working in Icefaces page
Description:
I have an example project to test the use of Shiro with Icefaces, but the Shiro tags do not work on the Icefaces page.
I have tried to convert the Icefaces with spring security example program to use Shiro instead of spring security, and while I can authenticate a user and roles appear to work with Icefaces components I have been unable to get tags to work.
For example in the page secured/welcome.jspx if I have a conditional display of a field depending on role the field always gets displayed.
Example:
<html xmlns:jsp="http://java.sun.com/JSP/Page"
xmlns:h="http://java.sun.com/jsf/html"
xmlns:f="http://java.sun.com/jsf/core" version="2.0"
xmlns:shiro="http://shiro.apache.org/tags"
xmlns:ice="http://www.icesoft.com/icefaces/component">
<head>
<title>Shiro Security with ICEfaces Components</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Hi <shiro:guest>Guest</shiro:guest><shiro:user><shiro:principal/> is logged on</shiro:user>
</p>
<shiro:authenticated>
<shiro:hasRole name="special">
<ice:outputText
value="Shiro authenticated users with special role can see this message."/>
</shiro:hasRole>
</shiro:authenticated>
Guest is shown although the user is authenticated, and principal shows nothing.
