Summary:
Typo in IniSecurityManagerFactory causes a requirement for a dummy Realm in addition to a RealmFactory
Description:
In the private addToRealms-method of IniSecurityManagerFactory, there is a check:
Collection<Realm> factoryRealms = factory.getRealms();
if (!CollectionUtils.isEmpty(realms)) {
realms.addAll(factoryRealms);
}
The if-clause should be against the factoryRealms variable, as this check forces one to create a dummy Realm in the configuration file in order for the factory created Realms to be added as well.
