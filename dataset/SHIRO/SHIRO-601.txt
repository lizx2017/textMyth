Summary:
deleted cookies don't set httpOnly flag. trigger warnings in PEN tools
Description:
When Shiro deletes a session cookie on logout it explicitly sets the httpOnly flag to false. This is triggering false positive warnings in PEN testing tools like OWASP.
To avoid this, Shiro should ALWAYS set the httpOnly flag for its session cookies whether they are being set to 'deleteMe' or not.
