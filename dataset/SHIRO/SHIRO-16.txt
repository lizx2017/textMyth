Summary:
removeMe cookie path is wrong at deletion if servlet context path is root ("/")
Description:
The fix for JSEC-34 changes the cookie path from "" (empty string) to "/" when the rememberMe cookie is created. The change to the path is not made, however, when the cookie is removed. This prevents the cookie from being removed. The attached patch introduces a new method "calculatePath()" that supplies the path both when the cookie is created and when it is removed. (Feel free to rename the method or make any other change.)
