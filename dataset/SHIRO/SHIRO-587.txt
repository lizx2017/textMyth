Summary:
Can't Access Groups If userPrincipalName Doesn't Exist
Description:
Sometimes you need to use sAMAccountName instead of userPrincipalName in your search.
However, this is hard-coded in a private method

There is a similar bug in Spring Security
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/issues/2448
Making the search query was configurable in the shiro.ini would be useful.
Making the getRoleNamesForUser protected instead of private would make sub-classing easier.
Or keep the method private but make a protected method that returns Object[] searchArguments.
