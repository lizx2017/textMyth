Summary:
Basic Auth Filter permissive mode does NOT work
Description:
The fix for SHIRO-200 assumed all filter options were http methods, for example:
{authcBasic[POST, GET]}
However, the 'permissive' option is also valid, which instructs the filter to check for authentication, but NOT require it:
{authcBasic[permissive]}
Or the two combine in something like:
authcBasic[permissive,POST, GET]
