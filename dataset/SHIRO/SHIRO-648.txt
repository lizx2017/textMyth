Summary:
SecurityUtils.getSubject() throws org.apache.geode.security.AuthenticationFailedException intermittently
Description:
When our application starts, we set the vm static SecurityManager using
SecurityUtils.setSecurityManager(xyz);
But sometimes when we do login using:
Subject currentUser = SecurityUtils.getSubject();
curentUser.login(tokent)
we occasionally get the following exception:
org.apache.geode.security.AuthenticationFailedException: No SecurityManager accessible to the calling code, either bound to the org.apache.shiro.util.ThreadContext or as a vm static singleton.  This is an invalid application configuration.
We suspect that it's because the vm static SecurityManager is not volatile and not visible to the login thread....
