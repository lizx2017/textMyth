Summary:
SessionsSecurityManager destroy() doesn't call super.destroy()
Description:
The destroy method in org.apache.shiro.mgt.SessionsSecurityManager does not make a call to super.destroy(). This is preventing the cache manager from being destroyed, as it lives further up the inheritance chain. All other *SecurityManager.destroy() methods properly invoke super.destroy().
