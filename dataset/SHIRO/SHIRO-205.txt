Summary:
Filter configs cannot contain commas in INI format
Description:
Consider this configuration:
[urls]
/test/** = roles[guest, admin]
The above won't work at the moment because PathMatchingFilter splits the right-hand value into 'roles[guest' and 'admin]'. Commas inside square brackets should be ignored when splitting the path value.
