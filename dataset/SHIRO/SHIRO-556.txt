Summary:
https://shiro.apache.org/realm.html appears to link to the javadoc under static/current/apidocs not static/latest
Description:
Tom Hayhurst (tom@catena-technologies.com) e-mailed the infrastructure@apache.org initially with:
"https://shiro.apache.org/static/current/apidocs/org/apache/shiro/realm/Realm.html gives me an HTTP 500 response."
This lead to the exchange:

Sorry - I should have explained. All of the non-Javadoc Shiro documentation (e.g. https://shiro.apache.org/realm.html) appears to link to the javadoc under static/current/apidocs not static/latest. I suppose the fact that I got a 500 not a 404 made me think that there was a problem with the server rather than the incoming link being wrong.
Thanks for the info!"
Handing off to the Shiro team.
