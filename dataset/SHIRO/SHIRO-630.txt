Summary:
ModularRealmAuthorizer ignores JAX-RS proxied Realms
Description:
I'm developing in a web environment that uses JAX-RS for dependency injection. I'd like to inject my realms by proxy so that they can be injected in request scope into singleton parents. However, the logic in ModularRealmAuthorizer#isPermitted(PrincipalCollection, Permission) does an `instanceof Authorizer` check that will fail for proxied, injected realms because they are of type `Proxy`. This issue seems to appear in versions 1.2 and later.
