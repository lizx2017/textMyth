Summary:
Session Timeout - Unconditional
Description:
The SimpleSession class is expiring sessions unconditionally after the default timeout of 30 minutes, regardless of any reads or writes to the session.
This issue is caused by the lastAccessTime field of the SimpleSession class not being updated when a session attribute is read or written. Since session expiration is dependent on the lastAccessTime value, this field needs to be updated each time a session attribute is read or written to the session.
The fix for this issue would be to call the touch() method of the SimpleSession class each time an attribute is read or written to the session. Since the touch() method updates the lastAccessTime field with the current time, this call is sufficient to perform the update that is required.
