Summary:
Build with Maven 3 generates a multitude of warnings.
Description:
We see multiple warnings like this: (one for each module)
[WARNING] Some problems were encountered while building the effective model for org.apache.shiro:shiro-core:bundle:1.2.0-SNAPSHOT
[WARNING] The expression ${scm.url} is deprecated. Please use ${project.scm.url} instead.
And then we also see:
[WARNING] Some problems were encountered while building the effective model for org.apache.shiro:shiro-features:pom:1.2.0-SNAPSHOT
[WARNING] 'build.plugins.plugin.version' for org.codehaus.mojo:build-helper-maven-plugin is missing. @ line 74, column 21
and
[WARNING] Some problems were encountered while building the effective model for org.apache.shiro.samples:samples-spring:war:1.2.0-SNAPSHOT
[WARNING] 'build.plugins.plugin.version' for org.codehaus.mojo:dependency-maven-plugin is missing. @ line 72, column 21
These are simple things that should be fixable with some minor pom updates and shouldn't break compatibility with Maven 2.
