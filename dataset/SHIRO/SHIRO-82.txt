Summary:
Shiro strips anchor (#) values from the URL if user is unauthenticated
Description:
If I enter URL with anchor tags such as ( http://www.myhost.com/home.html#action=doSomething ) in an unauthenticated browser, the anchor tag values are stripped and I am directed to http://www.myhost.com/home.html. The anchor tags should remain after authentication so that the user is directed to the proper location in the application.
