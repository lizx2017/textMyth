Summary:
unable to edit http://incubator.apache.org/ki/download.html
Description:
Content-wise, the line
svn co http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/jsecurity/trunk/
is to be replaced by
svn co http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/shiro/trunk/
.
I tried to edit this directly in the wiki. Ok, in a first step, anonymous editing is not allowed and the wiki demands me to create an account in order to be able to edit. I created the account "markus.pilzecker@web.de" and retry to edit the wiki page mentioned above.
Confluence answers with "Page not found", while clearly showing in the head line, that it considers me logged in as "markus.pilzecker@web.de".
{Ok, then, once another round to create ya account on Jira
{why two different?}
. 'Seemed to work. At least, I'm here. How many bugs remain unreported with this double loop?}
