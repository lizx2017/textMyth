Summary:
SimpleSession serializes fields twice
Description:
org.apache.shiro.session.mgt.SimpleSession serializes fields twice - once via the 'writeObject' implementations' call to out.writeDefaultObject(), and again via the custom bitmask-based serialization that follows it.
The internal fields should be marked as transient to prevent this. out.writeDefaultObject should still be called for JVM security reasons, but SimpleSession's custom field-based serialization is more efficient so it should be retained. The solution is to mark all custom-serialized fields as transient.
