Summary:
OSGi Import for JSP (javax.servlet.jsp) should be declared optional
Description:
I am using Shiro with OSGi (Equinox) in a web application. Yet I do not use JSP pages. Therefore I use the shiro web bundle without requiring the package *.tags.
So actually I do not need the jsp bundles as I don't use the tags. To avoid having to include the jsp bundles the import should be declared optional. I hacked up the manifest to suit my needs and it works just fine.
Another option would be to create a separate package like "shiro.web.jsp" which contains the code for using shiro with JSPs.
