Summary:
Realm not initialised when bound in servlet mode with guice
Description:
I have a SampleRealm class which extends TextConfigurationRealm.
I bind it in configureShiroWeb() method of ShiroWebModule with bindRealm().to(SampleRealm .class).in(Singleton.class);
My expectation is OnInit() to be called at some point.
But that never happens.
I guess that should happen through InitializableInjectionListener() with Guice, but doesn't get triggered.
