Summary:
Remember-me cookie path wrong if servlet context path is root ("/")
Description:
If a web application is installed in the root context of a servlet container, the remember-me cookie defaults to a value of "" (because that's what request.getContextPath() returns). Unfortunately, this appears to attach the cookie to the current request's URL rather than the required root, "/". The offending code is in org.jsecurity.web.attr.CookieAttribute where the onStoreValue() method does this:
String path = getPath() != null ? getPath() : request.getContextPath()
We should either always append '/' to the context path or set the cookie path to "/" if the request context path is an empty string.
