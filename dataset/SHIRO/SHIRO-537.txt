Summary:
Class load issue in OSGI in ClassUtils
Description:
I had the same issue that is described in:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20653146/how-to-load-class-in-an-osgi-e4-environment-while-using-shiro where it was suggested a bug was entered but never was, so here it is. A similar workaround worked for me:
Thread currentThread = Thread.currentThread();
ClassLoader originalCl = currentThread.getContextClassLoader();
try
{ Class<?> clazz = ((InfrastructureServer) server).getBundleContext().getBundle() .loadClass(CustomRolePermissionResolver.class.getName()); ClassLoader bundleClassLoader = clazz.getClassLoader(); currentThread.setContextClassLoader(bundleClassLoader); webappContext.deploy(httpServer); }
catch (ClassNotFoundException e)
{ // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); }
finally
{ currentThread.setContextClassLoader(originalCl); }
In addition, commons-collections 3.2.1 must be used in an OSGi environment, I suggest bumping your dependency.
