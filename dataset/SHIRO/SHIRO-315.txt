Summary:
SubjectAwareExecutorService in shiro-core does not compile
Description:
The method invokeAny in SubjectAwareExecutorService has wrong type. SubjectAwareExecutorService implements ExecutorService interface.
ExecutorService:
<T> T invokeAny(Collection<Callable<T>> tasks)
SubjectAwareExecutorService:
public <T> T invokeAny(Collection<? extends Callable<T>> tasks) throws InterruptedException, ExecutionException {
Reason: It is not possible to override Collection<Callable<T>> tasks with Collection<? extends Callable<T>> tasks. Such override would not be typesafe.
