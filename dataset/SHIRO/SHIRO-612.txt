Summary:
Need to upgrade BeanUtils to avoid vulnerability
Description:
Currently, the POM specifies to use BeanUtils 1.8.3. Unfortunately, this has a known vulnerability (https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-0114) and there's a Metasploit module available to make exploitation easier. This needs to be upgraded to the fixed version 1.9.3.
