Summary:
ShiroFilter does not work with proxied security manager
Description:
The ShiroFilter.isHttpSessions() method does an instanceof check on the security manager, checking whether it's an instance of DefaultWebSecurityManager.
This doesn't work when the security manager is a JDK proxy to a DefaultWebSecurityManager because the proxy implements the SecurityManager interface, which doesn't have the isHttpSessions() method.
Perhaps we should have a WebSecurityManager interface with the isHttpSessions() method defined on it?
