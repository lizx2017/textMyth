Summary:
Can't Search For Groups In Active Directory Without A System User
Description:
From http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39518150/how-do-i-search-for-ad-groups-in-shiro-without-a-system-user
I can authenticate with the ActiveDirectoryRealm but I can't search for groups without having a systemUser.
Most often, clients of my application don't have the system user/password and the admins don't like giving it out so they can't configure it properly.
Spring Security and GUI clients let you use the username and password that was used to log in with to search for the groups.
