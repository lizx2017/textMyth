Summary:
shiro-*-core Jars define some of the same classes from their dependencies
Description:
I've noticed that shiro-core.jar contains some of the same classes from its dependencies. For instance org.apache.shiro.cache.MemoryConstrainedCacheManager is present in shiro-core.jar, but also in shiro-cache.jar. There are at least a dozen other examples. Similar issue is present for shiro-crypto-core.jar, shiro-config-core.jar, etc. Is there a reason behind this?
