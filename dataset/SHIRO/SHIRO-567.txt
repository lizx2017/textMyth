Summary:
shiro-root-1.2.5.pom uses invalid encoding, fails to parse with Gradle 2.14
Description:
$> curl -s https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/shiro/shiro-root/1.2.5/shiro-root-1.2.5.pom| head -1
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF8"?>
"UTF8" is not a valid encoding, it should be "UTF-8". This makes Gradle fail to parse the pom. The 1.2.4 pom is correct.
