Summary:
setTarget method in DomainPermission does not set targets
Description:
The setTarget() method in org.apache.shiro.authz.permission.DomainPermission has an apparent typo, or copy paste error:
133 protected void setTargets(Set<String> targets) {
134 this.targets = targets;
135 if (this.targets != null && this.targets.equals(targets))
{ 136 return; 137 }
138 this.targets = targets;
139 setParts(domain, actions, targets);
140 }
As you can see, line 134 is a duplicate of line 138 and will in all cases, except where the argument targets is null, prevent execution from ever calling setParts() and functioning properly.
The work around for now is for classes extending DomainPermission to handle the call to setParts() directly.
