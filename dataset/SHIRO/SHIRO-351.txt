Summary:
Shiro Native Session implementation cannot extract JSESSIONID From URL if JSESSIONID is URL parameter (not HTTP parameter)
Description:
The background for this issue is here:
http://shiro-user.582556.n2.nabble.com/Shiro-Native-Sessions-quot-JSESSIONID-quot-or-quot-JSESSIONID-quot-td7367217.html
In summary the issue is that Shiro supports extracting JSESSIONID from urls of this format:
http://www.mycompany.com/myResource?JSESSIONID=ABCDEF
but not of this format (this URL format is generated by HTTPServletResponse encodeURL method and is Servlet specification 2.5 compliant):
http://www.mycompany.com/myResource;JSESSIONID=ABCDEF
Shiro should be able to support both URL formats.
