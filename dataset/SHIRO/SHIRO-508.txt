Summary:
Shiro blocking CORSFILTER Tomcat 8.0.9
Description:
Hi sir/madam,
I have the urgent problem in which I need your help. I am using Shiro, Tomcat 8.0.9 CORSFilter and RESTful WS. In my web.xml I have added Shiro filter as first entry and then tomcat CORSFILTER. When I do Jquery Ajax POST using cross domain and also my pass username and password. It gives me error since this shiro is blocking the cors. When I remove shiro filter from my web.xml then Ajax cross domain works fine. Please let me know how to resolve this issue. I'm writing this email with high hopes.
Regards,
Murtaza
