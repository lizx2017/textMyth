Summary:
Wrong description of JdbcRealm#setPermissionsQuery
Description:
Javadoc for JdbcRealm#setPermissionsQuery says:
"... and return a row
per permission with three columns containing the fully qualified name of the permission class, the permission
name, and the permission actions (in that order)..."
However the DEFAULT_PERMISSIONS_QUERY returns just 1 column, the permission name:
protected static final String DEFAULT_PERMISSIONS_QUERY = "select permission from roles_permissions where role_name = ?";
