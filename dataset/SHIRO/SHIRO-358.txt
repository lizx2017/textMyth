Summary:
Source Tarball doesn't Build
Description:
When extracting the source tarball for 1.2.0 (http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/shiro/1.2.0/shiro-root-1.2.0-source-release.zip), the maven build fails. It gives the following error in the root project:
[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.codehaus.mojo:buildnumber-maven-plugin:1.0-beta-4:create (default) on project shiro-root: Cannot get the revision information from the scm repository :
[ERROR] Error!
I am able to get it building by setting the revisionOnScmFailure in the buildnumber plugin configuration.
