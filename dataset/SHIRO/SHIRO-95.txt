Summary:
Specifying my own Cache in ShiroFilter not working
Description:
When I specify my own CacheManager and Cache object in my ShiroFilter, the default Cache manager is being used anyway. See thread "need help pluggin in my own session cache" in August and September 2009 archives of the Shiro mailing list for details.
This is another order-of-operations issue.
