Authentication cache

Please see this subject for details:

In short:
I can't set authenticationCachingEnabled from shiro.ini or realm constructor;
Even if it were set, as I managed to start an authentication cache, it would not work because !isAuthenticationCachingEnabled(token, info) always returns true in AuthenticatingRealm.cacheAuthenticationInfoIfPossible, returning w/o putting anything on the cache.
Otherwise the system logs say that it's using the cache...
