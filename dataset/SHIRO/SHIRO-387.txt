Summary:
EnvironmentLoader destroys wrong environment
Description:
I've got a singleton EnvironmentLoader that is used to create multiple environments for multiple servlet contexts. Initialization goes all well but destroying is done to the last created environment and not to the one that resides in given servlet context.
A simple fix/workaroud would be to change the destroyEnvironment as
Object environment = servletContext.getAttribute(ENVIRONMENT_ATTRIBUTE_KEY);
LifecycleUtils.destroy(environment);
Instance variable reference to last initialized environment should also be removed to allow garbage to be collected after last environment has been destroyed.
