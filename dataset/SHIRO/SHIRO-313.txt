Summary:
Default SessionManager in web environment for Guice support differs from the otherwise.
Description:
Using Ini setup, or simple construction, the default session manager for a web environment uses servlet container sessions. It appears that I overlooked this when adding the Guice integration and made the default for a guice web environment native sessions. Nothing inherently wrong with this other than the glaring inconsistency that I would expect to trip folks up. I am attaching a patch for this to this ticket.
