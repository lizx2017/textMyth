Summary:
HashedCredentialsMatcher getCredentials() bug
Description:
// isStoredCredentialsHexEncoded() always returns true, no matter if I store a hex or a base64 password or credential. Hex is Base16. Authentication fails if I store Base64 and don't move it to Hex before here with an IllegalArgumentException because Hex.decode(...) doesn't recognize but the 0..9 and a..f I think
//account.credentials were a char[] or String, so
//we need to do text decoding first:
if (isStoredCredentialsHexEncoded())
{ storedBytes = Hex.decode(storedBytes); }
else
{ storedBytes = Base64.decode(storedBytes); }

sha256Matcher = org.apache.shiro.authc.credential.HashedCredentialsMatcher
sha256Matcher.hashAlgorithmName=SHA-256
