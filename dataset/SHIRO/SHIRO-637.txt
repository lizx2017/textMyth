Summary:
Refresh cached session in HTTP request after user logs out
Description:
For native session management in web environments, the ShiroHttpServletRequest caches calls to getSession() by saving a copy of the current subject's session to a member variable. This copy is never updated even when the subject logs out and the session is destroyed.
When the session is accessed again after logout, an UnknownSessionException can be thrown because the session referenced in the request is not physically available anymore (this could be the cause for SHIRO-614).
The Shiro HTTP request therefore has to check the state of the cached session and refresh it if necessary, just as the original Jetty Request class does as well.
