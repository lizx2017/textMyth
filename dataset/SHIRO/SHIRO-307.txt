Summary:
DomainPermission does not fully support domain, actions and targets properties
Description:
Per the class javadoc, DomainPermission is designed to be a base class for Permission implementations that persist permission parts as separate properties. It defines private fields for domain, actions and targets and exposes getters/setters for these, but the setParts and constructor methods that set Permission state do not call the property setters and the property setters don't call setParts. Property synchronization needs to be added to this class.
