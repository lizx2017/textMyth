Summary:
Error in DOAP
Description:
The DOAP contains the following entries:
<category rdf:resource="http://projects.apache.org/category/library" />
<category rdf:resource="http://www.apache.org/category/web-framework"/>
Only the first one has the correct URL; please can you correct the other one to the following:
<category rdf:resource="http://projects.apache.org/category/web-framework"/>
Unfortunately there was an error on the page that described the categories (now fixed in SVN).
However the DOAP creation form was correct.
