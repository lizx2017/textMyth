Summary:
ShiroFilter entries being processed in arbitrary order
Description:
Copied over from the Ki issue. Original text:
Entries in a ShiroFilter configuration are not being processed in the order they are listed in.
If we have these lines:
sessionManager=org.apache.shiro.web.session.DefaultWebSessionManager
securityManager.sessionManager = $sessionManager
securityManager.sessionDAO = $sessionDAO
...and line 3 is processed before line 2, the setSessionManager() call for the first line fails because the sessionManager is a ServletContainerSessionManager rather than a DefaultWebSessionManager.
In ReflectionBuilder.buildObjects(), instanceMap and propertyMap need
to be LinkedHashMap type, not just HashMap. With HashMap, the
properties in ShiroFilter are being processed in arbitrary order,
rather than the order listed.
