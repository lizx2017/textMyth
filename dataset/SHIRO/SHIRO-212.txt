Summary:
Session managment seems to be bungled
Description:
This occurs in the struts 2 sample web site in the sandbox. When sessionMode is set to native for the org.apache.shiro.web.mgt.DefaultWebSecurityManager the JSESSION seems to be dropped and reset. You can see this as you log in using live http headers.
The observed behavior is that you are continuously prompted to login.
