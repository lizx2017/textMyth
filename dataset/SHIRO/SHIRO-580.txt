ShiroHttpServletRequest cached HttpSession
Description:
I try to implement sessionDao with redis
but I found ShiroHttpServletRequest cached HttpSession
when i login the system, for preventing session fixation attack, i call getSession().stop(), now the redis have no session information, then i call httpRequest.getSession(false), it will get the cached HttpSession that is not stored in redis. So the Exception will happened
what should I do to avoid this ?
