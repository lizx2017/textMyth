Summary:
AuthorizationFilter needs to use sendError not setStatus to make container process the request through ERROR dispatcher
Description:
AuthorizationFilter currently calls setStatus when returning SC_UNAUTHORIZED (401). This is wrong because container won't invoke ERROR dispatcher (and consequently, application filters handling custom error-pages don't have a chance to respond). Would have liked to make this my first commit, but I'll add a patch instead while I'm still waiting for my Apache account to be created. Free game for anybody to apply in the meantime.
