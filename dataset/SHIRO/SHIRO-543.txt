Summary:
Make build NOT require build requires ~/.m2/toolchains.xml by default
Description:
Reported on mailing list.
Users cannot build samples (or anything from the Shiro source tree) without a ~/.m2/toolchains.xml file.
This plugin requirement was added to work around CI / release issues. It looks like a valid fix, but the plugin def should likely be moved to a maven profile so a basic checkout and build will work.
