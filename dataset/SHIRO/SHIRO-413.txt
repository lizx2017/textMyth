Summary:
init() method is not called on class that implements org.apache.shiro.util.Initializable
Description:
Classes configured in shiro.ini that implement the "Initializable" interface should automatically have their "init()" methods called. It appears this call is not always occurring. Example below:
public class WaffleNegotiateAuthFilter extends BasicHttpAuthenticationFilter
implements Initializable
{
...
private final NegotiateSecurityFilter negotiateFilter;
public WaffleNegotiateAuthFilter()
{ negotiateFilter = new NegotiateSecurityFilter(); }
@Override
protected void onFilterConfigSet() throws Exception
{ negotiateFilter.init(getFilterConfig()); }
/**
Initializes this object.
*
@throws org.apache.shiro.ShiroException
if an exception occurs during initialization.
*/
public void init() throws ShiroException
Unknown macro: { try { super.init(getFilterConfig()); } catch (ServletException e) { throw new ShiroException(e); } }
...
I still do not see the init() method being called.
