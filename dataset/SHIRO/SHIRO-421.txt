Summary:
Unable to set long timeouts on HttpServletSession
Description:
When I set the timeout on a org.apache.shiro.web.session.HttpServletSession to a large value (30 days == 2592000000 milliseconds) using the setTimeout(long) method and then read the timeout with the getTimeout() method, I get -1702967296. I would like to be able to do this in order to have a long-lasting session for users who select "remember me" when logging in to a web app.
I think this may have something to do with the fact that the getTimeout() method is using integer multiplication before converting the javax.servlet.http.HttpSession's max inactive interval from an int to a long.
