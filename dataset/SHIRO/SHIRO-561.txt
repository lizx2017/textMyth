Summary:
"Remember me" cookie age is not verified server-side
Description:
The "remember me" cookie has a max age limit which is configurable in Shiro (see CookieRememberMeManager).
However, Shiro does not enforce this limit at all â€“ it trusts the client to expire the "remember me" cookie after the requested time limit.
Because the cookie value has no server-side age verification, if a malicious client gets a copy of the remember me cookie, then it will last forever, regardless of the max age limit configured in Shiro.
