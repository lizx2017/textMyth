Summary:
Update Shiro Logo to include trademark 'TM'
Description:
From: http://apache.org/foundation/marks/pmcs.html#graphics
Logos are important to recognize as trademarks as well. For the project's official logo (if it has one, and especially if it uses the ASF feather), ensure that it includes a small "TM" symbol in the graphic or immediately adjacent to it. For pages that include the project logo on them, ensure you mention "... and the Project logo are trademarks..." in the attribution.
The current log does NOT include the 'TM'
