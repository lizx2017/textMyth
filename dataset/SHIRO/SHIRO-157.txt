Summary:
RememberMeManager should no longer be consulted once a remembered identity is discovered
Description:
When discovering principals (PrincipalCollection) during Subject creation:
If there are no principals associated with the subject being constructed and principals are found from rememberMe, those principals should be added to the session to ensure they can be retrieved from the session on later requests. It is better to acquire this from the session so the RememberMeManager overhead (decryption and/or deserialization) is not incurred unnecessarily for every request.
