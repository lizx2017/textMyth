Summary:
Jenkins builds fail regularly
Description:
The Jenkins builds are failing on regular basis. There seems to be two reasons for this:
The build runs out of memory. This is a known caveat with the build - it can be fixed by adding "-Xmx96m -XX:MaxPermSize=96m" to MAVEN_OPTS.
ContainerIntegrationTest in the samples-web module fails to listen on the port it attempt to. This is a common issue on build servers as other builds or processes may already be occupying the port. This test can be modified to select the port dynamically.
I can fix the second one shortly with a patch to the test class, but I do not have access to the Jenkins configuration.
