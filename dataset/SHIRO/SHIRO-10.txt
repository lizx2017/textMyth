Summary:
Aliases in the ini configuration builder do not work correctly
Description:
Aliases in the ini configuration builder do not work correctly. When one gets updated the aliases do not. This can cause problems if one is explicitly creating a security manager and it gets overwritten by the default created and added w/ the "alias" sm. In this case the default replaces the explicitly created security manager.
