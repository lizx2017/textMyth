Summary:
Session Cookie will not be deleted on subjects logout
Description:
Our web application initializes Shiro through an .ini file. Within the ini file we set the application cookie as following:
Cookie Management
cookie = org.apache.shiro.web.servlet.SimpleCookie
cookie.name = AppCookie
cookie.secure = true
cookie.httpOnly = false
securityManager.sessionManager.sessionIdCookie = $cookie
Shiro runs in "native" session mode. When an user enters the application the MyCookie and an JSESSIONID cookie will be created. The session will be authenticated on subject.login(...). Everything works fine until the user log out and we call subject.logout() method.
It seems that the JSESSIONID cookie will not be deleted. The value of the cookie stays always the same, while the value(id) of our AppCookie always change. The problem is that the user get the same session again if he log in again. That means that the settings the user made before logout already exists on relogin.
