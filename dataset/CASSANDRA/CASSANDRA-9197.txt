Summary:
Startup slowdown due to preloading jemalloc
Description:
On my box, it seems that the jemalloc loading from CASSANDRA-8714 made the process take ~10 seconds to even start (I have no explication for it). I don't know if it's specific to my machine or not, so that ticket is mainly so someone else can check if it sees the same, in particular for jenkins. If it does sees the same slowness, we might want to at least disable jemalloc for dtests.
