Summary:
SSTableImportTest is looking for test resources that are not available via the pom
Description:
Trying to run 'mvn test' and a fresh checkout of the 5.0 branch results in a failure of org.apache.cassandra.tools.SSTableImportTest
The test resources are currently located in [basedir]/test/resources yet there is no <testResources> directive to include such in the pom. The following patch includes a fix to the test case for looking in the top-level of the classpath as well as a fix to the pom for including these resources.
