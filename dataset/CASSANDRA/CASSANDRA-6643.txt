Summary:
Limit user types to the keyspace they are defined in
Description:
I'm not 100% certain this is a bug.
The current syntax for "alter type rename" requires the keyspace on the old and new table name (if a keyspace is not active). So, to rename the type 'foo' to 'bar', you have to issue this statement:
ALTER TYPE ks.foo rename to ks.bar .
As a result, this syntax will also allow renaming the type into another existing keyspace, which updates the metadata in system.schema_usertypes.
I'm wondering if perhaps we can omit the second keyspace prefix and implicitly rename into the same keyspace.
To reproduce:
cqlsh> create keyspace user_types with replication = {'class':'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor':3} ;
cqlsh> create keyspace user_types2 with replication = {'class':'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor':3} ;
cqlsh> CREATE TYPE user_types.simple_type (user_number int);
cqlsh> alter type user_types.simple_type rename to user_types2.simple_type;
Renaming to another keyspace is also possible when a keyspace is active, like so:
cqlsh:user_types> alter type simple_type rename to user_types2.simple_type;
