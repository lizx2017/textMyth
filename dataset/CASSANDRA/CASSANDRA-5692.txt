Summary:
Race condition in detecting version on a mixed 1.1/1.2 cluster
Description:
On a mixed 1.1 / 1.2 cluster, starting 1.2 nodes fires sometimes a race condition in version detection, where the 1.2 node wrongly detects version 6 for a 1.1 node.
It works as follows:
1) The just started 1.2 node quickly opens an OutboundTcpConnection toward a 1.1 node before receiving any messages from the latter.
2) Given the version is correctly detected only when the first message is received, the version is momentarily set at 6.
3) This opens an OutboundTcpConnection from 1.2 to 1.1 at version 6, which gets stuck in the connect() method.
Later, the version is correctly fixed, but all outbound connections from 1.2 to 1.1 are stuck at this point.
Evidence from 1.2 logs:
