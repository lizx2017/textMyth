Summary:
Too many splits for ColumnFamily with only a few rows
Description:
ColumnFamilyInputFormat creates splits for the entire Keyspace. If one ColumnFamily has 100 Million rows and another has only 100 rows, the number of splits will be the 1,526 (assuming 64k rows per split) for either one, since it is based on the total number of unique keys across the whole keyspace, and not on the number of rows in the ColumnFamily.
