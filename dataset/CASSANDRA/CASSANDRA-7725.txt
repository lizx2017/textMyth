Summary:
CqlRecordReader does not validate input_cql Statments
Description:
CRR reader doesn't validate input_cql statements which can lead to some very dangerous results. In general we should make sure that the statement conforms to the required template and throw an exception if they don't.
For example if a use puts in an input statement like
SELECT * from ks.tab
Will run but will run the same query for each split.
