Summary:
Secondary index doesn't get repaired
Description:
Looks like secondary indexes don't get repaired by any of the Cassandra repair mechanisms for NetworkTopologyStrategy. SimpleStrategy however works fine.
The issue started as a mail to Cassandra userlist: http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.db.cassandra.user/30909
I striped reproduction recipe down and made a d-test which inserts two rows into a cluster of two nodes, where the first node goes down after the first insert and goes back up after the second insert. Secondary index doesn't get repaired by neither hinted-handoff, read repair, nor manual 'repair' operation which the d-test triggers before reading the data.
Moreover the second row is not visible in the index unless I do CL.ALL read or drop/create the index.
