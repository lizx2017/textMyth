Summary:
Endpoint cache for a token should be part of AbstractReplicationStrategy and not Snitch
Description:
There is a single DynamicEndpointSnitch object for all ReplicationStrategy objects. This DynamicEndpointSnitch object contains a single IEndpointSnitch subsnitch object. This subsnitch object contains the Endpoint cache for a token. Thus there is a single endpoint cache for all ReplicationStrategy objects. This implies that replica nodes for a Token as returned by the Cache would be same irrespective of the ReplicationStrategy object. This is a bug, the Endpoint cache should be a part of "AbstractReplicationStrategy" object rather than the IEndpointSnitch object.
