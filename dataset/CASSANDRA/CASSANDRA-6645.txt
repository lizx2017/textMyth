Summary:
upgradesstables causes NPE for secondary indexes without an underlying column family
Description:
SecondaryIndex#getIndexCfs is allowed to return null by contract, if the index is not backed by a column family, but this causes an NPE as StorageService#getValidColumnFamilies and StorageService#upgradeSSTables do not check for null values.
