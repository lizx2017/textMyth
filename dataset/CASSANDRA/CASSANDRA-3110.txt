Summary:
SSTables iterators are closed and before being used
Description:
Seems there is misplaced finally blocks in CollationController: we close the sstable iterators and release the sstable references before having actually used said iterators/sstables.
Note: this cause a lot of tests to fail in `ant test-compression` in particular.
