Summary:
Indexes: Auto-generating the CFname may collide with user-generated names
Description:
column_families:
  - name: CF
    comparator: BytesType
    column_metadata: 
      - name: foo
        index_name: 626172
        index_type: KEYS
      - name: bar
        index_type: KEYS
Auto-generated versus user-supplied names collide in the YAML above. The code:
cfname = parentCf + "." + (info.getIndexName() == null ? FBUtilities.bytesToHex(info.name) : info.getIndexName())
From the first ColumnDefinition, we create cfname = "CF.626172" (from the fail clause of the ternany, user-supplied name)
From the second ColumnDefinition, we create cfname = "CF.626172" (from the pass clause of the ternary, we generate the name)
They're in hex form. This is possible, but fairly unlikely that someone will do this.
