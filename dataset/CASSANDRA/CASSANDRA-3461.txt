Summary:
Server-side fatal exception when mixing column types in DynamicCompositeType
Description:
Running this CLI script with cause the Cassandra server to throw a fatal exception, and the CLI to hang for some seconds and then just display "null":
create keyspace Test;
use Test;
create column family Composite with comparator ='DynamicCompositeType (a=>AsciiType,s=>UTF8Type)';
set Composite[ascii('key')]['s@one']=ascii('value');
set Composite[ascii('key')]['a@two']=ascii('value');
It appears DynamicCompositeType does not allow mixing different types of components in the same "position" for the same row, which makes sense, but shouldn't this be a controled error and passed to the client, instead of throwing a fatal exception in the server side?
