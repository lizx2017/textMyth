Summary:
Support Thrift tables clustering columns on CqlPagingInputFormat
Description:
CASSANDRA-5752 introduced support to thrift tables on CQLPagingInputFormat via the retrieveKeysForThriftTables() method.
However, this method only retrieves partition keys from CFMetaData, so clustering columns are ignored.
So, when the RowIterator tries to fetch the next page of a wide-row thrift CF, it ignores the clustering column altogether, going to the next partition token. So, only cassandra.input.page.row.size CQL rows are retrieved for each partition key.
CqlRecordWriter had the same issue and was fixed on bcfe352ea6ed3786f274b90191f988210360689d (CASSANDRA-5718).
