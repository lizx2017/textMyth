Summary:
sstablekeys silently ignores extra arguments
Description:
sstablekeys only passes arg $1 to SSTableExporter instead of passing all arguments, like sstable2json. Only one SSTable is allowed as an argument, but this is normally detected in SSTableExporter.java. By only passing the one argument, we end up silently ignoring the remaining arguments.
