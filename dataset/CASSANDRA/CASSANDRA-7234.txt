Summary:
Post-compaction cache preheating can result in FileNotFoundExceptions when tables are dropped
Description:
In CompactionTask.java, after a compaction finishes, we do this:
        replaceCompactedSSTables(toCompact, sstables);
        // TODO: this doesn't belong here, it should be part of the reader to load when the tracker is wired up
        for (SSTableReader sstable : sstables)
            sstable.preheat(cachedKeyMap.get(sstable.descriptor));
The problem is that if the table was dropped, replaceCompactedSSTables will release its references on the new sstables, resulting in them being closed.
