Summary:
Don't use strict endpoint selection for range movements where RF == node count
Description:
Post CASSANDRA-2434, we should skip strict endpoint selection for ranges where RF == the number of nodes in the cluster otherwise we hit the following assertion in RangeStreamer.getAllRangesWithStrictSourcesFor
if (oldEndpoints.size() == strat.getReplicationFactor())
{
    oldEndpoints.removeAll(newEndpoints);
    assert oldEndpoints.size() == 1 : "Expected 1 endpoint but found " + oldEndpoints.size();
}
I think this is a fairly niche case, plus there's a workaround in the -Dcassandra.consistent.rangemovement=false option.
