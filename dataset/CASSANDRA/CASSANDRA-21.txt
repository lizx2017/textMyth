Summary:
get_columns_in fails when when routed to a node that isn't the home for the key
Description:
get_columns_in fails when the request cannot be satisfied locally.
What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Insert multiple columns in some row R in a Cassandra cluster that
contains more than 1 node.
2. Submit a get_columns_in query to a bunch of nodes. Using the python thrift
interface, this is something like:
./Cassandra-remote -h node0:9160 get_columns_in 'Mailbox' 'rowid123'
'HeaderList' "['col1','col2']"
./Cassandra-remote -h node1:9160 get_columns_in 'Mailbox' 'rowid123'
'HeaderList' "['col1','col2']"
I've traced the error to a bug in how ReadMessage.java gets de-serialized. See attached unit-test to reproduce this.
I'm also attaching a patch that fixes this.
