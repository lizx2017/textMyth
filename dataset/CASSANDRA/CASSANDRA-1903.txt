Summary:
NullPointerException from o.a.c.db.ReplicateOnWriteTask
Description:
I'm seeing a whole lot of these when writing to a node.
java.lang.NullPointerException
 at org.apache.cassandra.db.ReplicateOnWriteTask.run(ReplicateOnWriteTask.java:97)
 at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1110)
 at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:603)
 at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:636)
I don't think it will be difficult to reproduce, but the script I'm using is attached.
I bisected the source tree and and http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=1052356 seems to the culprit (a merge from 0.7). Maybe CASSANDRA-1530?
