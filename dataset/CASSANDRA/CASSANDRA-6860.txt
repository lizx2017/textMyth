Summary:
Race condition in Batch CLE
Description:
CASSANDRA-6759 exposed a bug in CLE, where we are signalling the waiting segments before setting the value they're waiting on. This is occurring much more readily now as we perform a slow call in the middle of the race. Attaching a quick and simple patch.
