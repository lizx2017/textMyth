Summary:
ScrubTest.testScrubOutOfOrder should generate test file on the fly
Description:
ScrubTest#testScrubOutOfOrder is failing on trunk due to the serialization format change from pre-generated out-of-order SSTable.
We should change that to generate out-of-order SSTable on the fly so that we don't need to bother generating SSTable by hand again.
