Summary:
Regression in mixed single and multi-column relation support
Description:
In 2.0.6 through 2.0.8, a query like the following was supported:
SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE clustering_0 = ? AND (clustering_1, clustering_2) > (?, ?)
However, after CASSANDRA-6875, you'll get the following error:
Clustering columns may not be skipped in multi-column relations. They should appear in the PRIMARY KEY order. Got (c, d) > (0, 0)
