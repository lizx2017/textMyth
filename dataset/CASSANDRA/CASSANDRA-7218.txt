Summary:
cassandra-all:2.1.0-beta1 maven dependency failing
Description:
I have included cassandra-all in my gradle dependencies list. Here is it:
compile org.apache.cassandra:cassandra-all:2.1.0-beta1
But when I am trying to build, it is failing with the following exception:
What went wrong:
Could not resolve all dependencies for configuration ':mapro-commons:compile'.
> Could not find com.github.stephenc:jamm:0.2.6.
Required by:
MAPro_Transactor:mapro-commons:1.0 > org.apache.cassandra:cassandra-all:2.1.0-beta1
Now I can not find com.github.stephenc:jamm:0.2.6. in maven repository.
