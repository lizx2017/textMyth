Summary:
cqlsh timestamp formatting is broken - displays wrong timezone info (at least on Ubuntu)
Description:
cqlsh> create keyspace test with strategy_class = 'SimpleStrategy' AND strategy_options:replication_factor = 1;
cqlsh> use test;
cqlsh:test> create table ts (id int primary key, ts timestamp);
cqlsh:test> insert into ts (id, ts) values (1, '2012-05-14 07:53:20+0000');
cqlsh:test> select * from ts;
id | ts
---+-------------------------
1 | 2012-05-14 10:53:20+0000
Should've been 2012-05-14 10:53:20+0300.
cqlsh formats timestamps using '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S%z' format-string and 'the %z escape that expands to the preferred hour/minute offset is not supported by all ANSI C libraries'. In this case it's just replaced with all zeroes.
