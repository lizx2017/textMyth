Summary:
Bootstrap is broken in 1.0.0-rc1
Description:
The commit of #3219 introduced two bugs: the condition to bootstrap is that there are non-system tables instead, a not is missing, and the setToken() was wrongly push up into the "I'm not bootstrapping" block so a boostrapping node was left in the joining state.
