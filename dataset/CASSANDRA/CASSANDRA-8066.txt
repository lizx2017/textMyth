Summary:
High Heap Consumption due to high number of SSTableReader
Description:
Given a workload with quite a lot of reads, I recently encountered high heap memory consumption. Given 2GB of Heap, it appears I have 750.000+ tasks in SSTableReader.syncExecutor, consuming more than 1.2GB. These tasks have type SSTableReader$5, which I guess corresponds to :
readMeterSyncFuture = syncExecutor.scheduleAtFixedRate(new Runnable()
{
public void run()
{
if (!isCompacted.get())
{
meterSyncThrottle.acquire();
SystemKeyspace.persistSSTableReadMeter(desc.ksname, desc.cfname, desc.generation, readMeter);
}
}
}, 1, 5, TimeUnit.MINUTES);
I do not have have to the environment right now, but I could provide a threaddump later if necessary.
