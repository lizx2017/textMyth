Summary:
ByteBufferUtil.clone shouldn't mutate the passed bytebuffer
Description:
Currently ByteBufferUtil.clone uses .mark and .reset on the passed ByteBuffer.
This is fine when using thrift because no two ByteBuffer are being accessed at the same time, but this could be thread-unsafe if the same BB was passed concurrently.
Solandra is having problems with this (Solandra shares JVM with Cassandra).
