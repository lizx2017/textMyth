Summary:
cassandra.bat fails when CASSANDRA_HOME contains a whitespace, again
Description:
I installed cassandra into C:\Program Files\apache-cassandra and tried to start cassandra. But cassandra.bat fails with following error.
 
C:\Program Files\apache-cassandra>bin\cassandra.bat
Starting Cassandra Server
Error opening zip file or JAR manifest missing : C:\Program
Error occurred during initialization of VM
agent library failed to init: instrument
This problem is similar to CASSANDRA-2237. I'll post a patch to fix the problem later.
