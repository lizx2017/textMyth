Summary:
Make CqlInputFormat and CqlRecordReader consistent with comments
Description:
Both the CqlInputFormat and CqlPagingInputFormat have the following comment:
/**
...
 *   the number of CQL rows per page
 *   CQLConfigHelper.setInputCQLPageRowSize. The default page row size is 1000. You 
 *   should set it to "as big as possible, but no bigger." It set the LIMIT for the CQL 
 *   query, so you need set it big enough to minimize the network overhead, and also
 *   not too big to avoid out of memory issue.
...
**/
The property is used in both classes, but the default is only set to 1000 in CqlPagingRecordReader explicitly.
We should either make the default part of the CqlConfigHelper so it's set in both places or update the comments in the CqlInputFormat to say that if it's not set, it will default to the java driver fetch size which is 5000.
