Summary:
IncomingTcpConnection can not be closed when the peer is brutaly terminated or switch is failed
Description:
IncomingTcpConnection has no way to detect the peer is down when the peer meets power loss or the network infrastructure is failed, and the thread is leaked...
For safety, as least SO_KEEPALIVE should be set on those IncomingTcpConnections. The better way is to close the incoming connections when failure detector notifies the peer failure, but it requires some extra bookmarking.
Besides it, it would be better if IncomingTcpConnection and OutgoingTcpConnection is marked as daemon thread...
