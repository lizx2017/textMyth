Summary:
bugs with index promotion and deletionInfo
Description:
Inspecting the read path for CASSANDRA-4180 reveals several bugs introduced by index promotion. Most fall into two categories:
Conflating RowIndexEntry.isIndexed with hasPromotedIndex (if the latter is true, we need to include its deletion info, even if there are no index entries, which is what the former refers to)
Incorrectly assuming RowIndexEntry.deletionInfo is the entire DeletionInfo for the row, when it really only includes range tombstones
