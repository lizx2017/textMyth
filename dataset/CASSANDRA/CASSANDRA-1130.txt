Summary:
Row iteration can stomp start-of-row mark
Description:
Hello,
I am trying to use TTL (timeToLive) feature in SuperColumns.
My usecase is:
I have a SuperColumn and 3 subcolumns.
I try to expire data after 60 seconds.
While Cassandra is up and running, I am successfully able to push and read data without any problems. Data compaction and all occurs fine. After inserting say about 100000 records, I stop Cassandra while data is still coming.
On startup Cassandra throws an exception and won't start up. (This happens 1 in every 3 times). Exception varies like:
EOFException while reading data
negative value encountered exception
Heap Space Exception
Cassandra simply won't start up.
Again I get this problem only when I use TTL with SuperColumns. There are no issues with using TTL with regular Columns.
I tried to diagnose the problem and it seems to happen on startup when it sees a Column that is marked Deleted and its trying to read data. Its off by some bytes and hence all these exceptions.
Caused by: java.io.IOException: Corrupt (negative) value length encountered
