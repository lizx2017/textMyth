Summary:
SSTableScanner may not acquire reference, but will still release it when closed
Description:
getRangeSlice and related methods do not require a reference to perform a safe read, so during one it is possible for SSTableScanner to fail to acquire a reference to the table it's being created on. In this case it doesn't fail, but it also doesn't log that no reference was acquired; on close, it still releases the reference that it never held.
We can fix this one of two ways: we can tell the scanner if we require a reference to be acquired; or we can track if one was obtained. The former is a bit more invasive but probably better, since we probably care if we fail to grab one in cases where we need it, and probably don't want to grab one otherwise.
