Summary:
$JVM_EXTRA_OPTS not properly sourced
Description:
JVM options set in /etc/default/cassandra whit $JVM_EXTRA_OPTS are not properly sourced. The default file is sourced in the init script with the cassandra-env.sh. But in /usr/sbin/cassandra only cassandra-env.sh is sourced, not default so $JVM_EXTRA_OPTS are not applied to cassandra process.
