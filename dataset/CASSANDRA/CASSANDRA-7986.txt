Summary:
The Pig tests cannot run on Cygwin on Windows
Description:
When running the Pig-Tests on Cygwin Windows I run into https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-7682.
Ideally this issue should be properly fix in HADOOP but as the issue is open since September 2011 it will be good if we implemented the workaround mentionned by Joshua Caplan for the Pig-Tests (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-7682?focusedCommentId=13440120&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13440120)
