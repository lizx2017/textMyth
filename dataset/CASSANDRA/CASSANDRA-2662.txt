Summary:
Nodes get ignored by dynamic snitch when read repair chance is zero
Description:
DynamicEndpointSnitch falls back to subsnitch when one of the scores of the endpoints being compared is missing.
This leads to a stable order of hosts until reads will lead to recorded scores.
If setting read repair chance to 0 and reads are performed with quorum then (rf - # quorum nodes) will never get reads.
