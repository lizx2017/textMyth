Summary:
Incorrect IOException in SequenceFile when BF returns false positive
Description:
In SequenceFile.AbstractReader.seekTo(), an IOException is thrown when a key can't be found in an SSTable. This is incorrect. The BF associated with the SSTable could return a false positive. So a key may indeed not be present in the SSTable file. We need to handle this case accordingly.
