Summary:
Inconsistent select count
Description:
I am running the dtest simultaneous_bootstrap_test located at https://github.com/riptano/cassandra-dtest/compare/cassandra-7069 and finding that at the final data verification step, the query SELECT COUNT FROM keyspace1.standard1 alternated between correctly returning 500,000 rows and returning 500,001 rows. Running cleanup or compaction does not affect the behavior. I have verified with sstable2json that there are exactly 500k rows on disk between the two nodes in the cluster.
I am reproducing this on trunk currently. It is not happening on 2.1-head.
