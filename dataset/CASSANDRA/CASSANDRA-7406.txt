Summary:
Reset version when closing incoming socket in IncomingTcpConnection should be done atomically
Description:
When closing incoming socket, the close() method will call MessagingService.resetVersion(), this behavior may clear version which is set by another thread.
This could cause MessagingService.knowsVersion(endpoint) test results as false (expect true here).
