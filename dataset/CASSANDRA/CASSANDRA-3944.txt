BulkRecordWriter will throw NullExceptions if no data is sent with the reducer
Description:
In the BulkRecordWriter, in the close() method if no actual output is sent to the reducer, which can be caused by having too many reducers and not enough map data, we throw null exceptions and the job can fail.
