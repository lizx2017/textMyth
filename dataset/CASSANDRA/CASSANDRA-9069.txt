Summary:
debug-cql broken in trunk
Description:
debug-cql is broken on trunk.
At startup it just says:
Error: Exception thrown by the agent : java.lang.NullPointerException
That exception originates from JMX agent (which cannot bind).
It can be reproduced by starting C* locally and starting debug-cql.
Workaround is to comment out sourcing of cassandra-env.sh.
