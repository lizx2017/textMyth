Summary:
Fix? jar conflict with ecj
Description:
hadoop-core pulls in core-3.1.1.jar which is an older version of ecj-4.4.2 which is now used directly for UDFs. Thus there are package/class conflicts between the two, when both are present on the classpath (at present)
Made changes to remove the older core-3.1.1 dependency, and now the hadoop code relies on ecj-4.4.2. Code compiles, but not sure what needs to be done to validate the hadoop still works properly now only relying on ecj-4.4.2
