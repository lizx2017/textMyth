Summary:
Select Count(*) on empty table does not return 0 in trunk
Description:
The test cql_tests.py:TestCQL.bug_6612_test is failing when performing a
 select count (*) 
on an empty table. It is expecting to have [0] returned, but instead [] is returned. 2.1.1 shows the expected behavior, with trunk HEAD deviating.
With cqlsh I can see a change in how select count(*) changes on an empty table as well:
