Summary:
JMX attribute setters not consistent with cassandra.yaml
Description:
If a setting is configurable both via cassandra.yaml and JMX, the two should be consistent. If that doesn't hold, then the JMX setter can't be trusted.
Here I present the example of phi_convict_threshold.
I'm trying to set phi_convict_threshold via JMX, which sets FailureDetector.phiConvictThreshold_, but this doesn't update Config.phi_convict_threshold, which gets its value from cassandra.yaml when starting up.
Some places, such as FailureDetector.interpret(InetAddress), use FailureDetector.phiConvictThreshold_; others, such as AntiEntropyService.line 813 in cassandra-1.1.2, use Config.phi_convict_threshold:
            // We want a higher confidence in the failure detection than usual because failing a repair wrongly has a high cost.
            if (phi < 2 * DatabaseDescriptor.getPhiConvictThreshold())
                return;
where DatabaseDescriptor.getPhiConvictThreshold() returns Conf.phi_convict_threshold.
So, it looks like there are cases where a value is stored in multiple places, and setting the value via JMX doesn't set all of them. I'd say there should only be a single place where a configuration parameter is stored, and that single field:
should read in the value from cassandra.yaml, optionally falling back to a sane default
should be the field that the JMX attribute reads and sets, and
any place that needs the current global setting should get it from that field. However, there could be cases where you read in a global value at the start of a task and keep that value locally until the end of the task.
Also, anything settable via JMX should be volatile or set via a synchronized setter, or else according to the Java memory model other threads may be stuck with the old setting.
So, I'm requesting the following:
Setting up guidelines for how to expose a configuration parameter both via cassandra.yaml and JMX, based on what I've mentioned above
Going through the list of configuration parameters and fixing any that don't match those guidelines
I'd also recommend logging any changes to configuration parameters.
