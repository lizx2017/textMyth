Summary:
system_drop_column_family() and system_rename_column_family() should not take keyspace args
Description:
With the addition of set_keyspace(), things that are scoped by keyspace should no longer take keyspace args. system_add_column_family() is correct in only taking a cf_def. system_drop_column_family() and system_rename_column_family() should be changed to match.
