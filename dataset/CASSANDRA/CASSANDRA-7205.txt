Summary:
Node never know a table has been DROP or CREATE if its gossip is disabled while executing this query
Description:
I'm using Cassandra 2.0.6 and I have 8 nodes. I'm doing some tests by using operations below:
disable gossip of node A;
check the status by nodetool in other node, node A is Down now;
use cqlsh connecting an "Up" node and create a table;
enable gossip of node A;
check the status, all nodes are "Up" now.
Then I find that node A doesn't know this table has been created. Both its own cql shell and nodetool cfstats tell me the table doesn't exist. Even waiting for a few minutes to get the "eventual consistency" final status, node A still doesn't know this table. And I find if each node knows there is a table but I drop it when one node's gossip is disabled, this node will never know the table has been dropped.
Is this a bug?
