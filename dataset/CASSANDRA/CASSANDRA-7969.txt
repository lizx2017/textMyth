Summary:
Properly track min/max timestamps and maxLocalDeletionTimes for range and row tombstones
Description:
First problem is that when we have only row or range tombstones in an sstable we dont update the maxLocalDeletionTime for the sstable
Second problem is that if we have a range tombstone in an sstable, minTimestamp will always be Long.MIN_VALUE for flushed sstables due to how we set the default values for the variables
