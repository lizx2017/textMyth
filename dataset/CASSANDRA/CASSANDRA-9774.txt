Summary:
fix sstableverify dtest
Description:
One of our dtests for sstableverify (offline_tools_test.py:TestOfflineTools.sstableverify_test) is failing hard on trunk (cassci history)
The way the test works is by deleting an SSTable, then running sstableverify on its table. In earlier versions, it successfully detects this problem and outputs that it "was not released before the reference was garbage collected". The test no longer finds this string in the output; looking through the output of the test, it doesn't look like it reports any problems at all.
EDIT: After digging into the C* source a bit, I may have misattributed the problem to sstableverify; this could be a more general memory management problem, as the error text expected in the dtest is emitted by part of the Ref implementation:
