Summary:
Some queries with collections require quoting the key even when the key is an integer
Description:
collections (id int primary key, amap map<int, varchar>);
"UPDATE test.collections SET amap[1] = 'text' WHERE id = 0" -> List operations are only supported on List typed columns
"UPDATE test.collections SET amap['1'] = 'text' WHERE id = 0" -> ok
Not sure if boolean/double/uuid/etc. are affected or require quoting as well.
DELETE is not affected though: "DELETE amap[1] from test.collections where id = 0" -> ok
