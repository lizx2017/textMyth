Summary:
Saved key cache is not loaded when opening ColumnFamily
Description:
This bug happens on cassandra version 1.1.3 ~ 1.1.x only
In order to load key cache in SSTableReader#open, keyCache has to be set by calling setTrackedBy before loading. CASSANDRA-4436 changed the order to load then setTrackedBy, so saved key cache is never loaded.
In 1.2, key cache stores both key and position, and is loaded out side of SSTableReader so the issue only happens on 1.1.x branch.
