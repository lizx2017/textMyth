Summary:
GossipingPropertyFileSnitch does not auto-reload local rack/dc
Description:
With the property file snitch, I can change the rack and dc of a node in cassandra-topology.properties from DC1/RAC1 to DC2/RAC2 while the server is running and that configuration is reloaded a short time later.
With the gossiping property file snitch, I change the cassandra-rackdc.properties when the server is running from DC1/RAC1 to DC2/RAC2 while the server is running and it never reloads. It requires a restart.
