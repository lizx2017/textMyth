Summary:
bulkLoad() method in StorageService throws AssertionError
Description:
Firstly, I apologize if this is a duplicate, as I cannot find a bug related to that.
We tried to stream some data to our Cassandra cluster by using JMX bulkLoad method. However, jmx reports a AssertionError since 1.1.0. I haven't really debugged into Cassandra, but by eyeballing the code it seems the AssertionError is thrown from SSTableReader.open() method with the line:
assert practitioner != null;
and tracing the code backwards, it seems the code in SSTableLoader.openSSTables() method has been changed to get the partitioner from the impl of inner class SSTableLoader.Client:
sstables.add(SSTableReader.open(desc, components, null, client.getPartitioner()));
This is different than 1.0.x codebase, when the partitioner is retrieved from StorageService:
sstables.add(SSTableReader.open(desc, components, null, StorageService.getPartitioner()));
The problem seems to me is when StorageService.bulkLoad instantiaties an impl of SSTableLoader.Client() it never does anything with the partitioner, resulting in the call 'client.getPartitioner()' returning null, thus the AssertionError.
(Note: this is me eyeballing the code only without debugging into it).
