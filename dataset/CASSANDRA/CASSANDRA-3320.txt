Summary:
pig_cassandra script errors when running against pig 0.9.1 tar ball because there are multiple jars.
Description:
The pig_cassandra script in contrib/pig/bin assumes there is only one pig jar file in $PIG_HOME. However, the latest release of pig 0.9.1 has two jar files: one for hadoop and one without hadoop. See below:
bone@zen:~/tools/pig-0.9.1-> ls -al *.jar
rw-rr- 1 bone staff 5130595 Sep 29 18:55 pig-0.9.1-withouthadoop.jar
rw-rr- 1 bone staff 12430153 Sep 29 18:55 pig-0.9.1.jar
This breaks the shell script with:
bin/pig_cassandra: line 42: [: /Users/bone/tools/pig/pig-0.9.1-withouthadoop.jar: binary operator expected
Unrecognized option: -x
Attached is a patch for the shell script that takes the last jar file listed in the directory. This fixes the problem. I also add an "echo" to notify the user which jar file they are using.
