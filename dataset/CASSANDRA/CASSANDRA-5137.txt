Summary:
Make sure SSTables left over from compaction get deleted and logged
Description:
When opening ColumnFamily, cassandra checks SSTable files' ancestors and skips loading already compacted ones. Those files are expected to be deleted, but currently that never happens.
Also, there is no indication of skipping loading file in the log, so it is confusing especially doing upgradesstables.
