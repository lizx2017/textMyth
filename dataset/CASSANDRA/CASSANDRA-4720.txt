Summary:
cqlsh fails to format timeuuid values
Description:
If a user has a table with a timeuuid column, and the user tries to select some rows containing timeuuid values, a weird error results:
global name 'unix_time_from_uuid1' is not defined
Not very helpful. It should probably display the timeuuid somehow.
