Summary:
Gossip sends removed node which causes restarted nodes to constantly create new threads
Description:
Our cassandra cluster had 14 nodes but it was mostly idle so about 2 weeks ago we removed 3 of them (via standard decommision) & moved tokens to balance load.
Since then no node was restarted but last week after restarting 2 of them we observed that both of them spawn threads ( WRITE-/1.2.3.4 where 1.2.3.4 is one of removed nodes IPs ) till they hit limit ( which is 800 on our system) and then cassandra dies. Not restarted nodes do not do that. There are no outgoing connections to those dead nodes
I noticed dead nodes are still in nodetool gossipinfo on non-restarted nodes but not on restarted ones so it seems they are not propertly removed from gossip.
Would rolling restart work for fixing this or is full cluster stop-start required ?
