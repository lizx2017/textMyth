Summary:
Wrong bloom_filter_fp_chance for newly created CFs with LeveledCompactionStrategy
Description:
0.1 is supposed to be the default bloom_filter_fp_chance for LeveledCompactionStrategy (and 0.01 for all other strategies).
However, CFPropDefs#applyToCFMetadata() sets bloom_filter_fp_chance before setting compaction strategy class, so the default bloom_filter_fp_chance is always 0.01 no matter what the compaction strategy is.
The fix is to move cfm#bloomFilterFpChance() call below cfm#compressionParameters().
The attached patch also kills dead default consistency level-related code.
