Summary:
Make Range and Bounds objects client-safe
Description:
From Mck's comment on CASSANDRA-1125:
Something broke here in production once we went out with 0.8.2. It may have been some poor testing, i'm not entirely sure and a little surprised.
CFIF:135 breaks because inside dhtRange.intersects(jobRange) there's a call to new Range(token, token) which calls StorageService.getPartitioner() and StorageService is null as we're not inside the server.
A quick fix is to change Range:148 from new Range(token, token) to new Range(token, token, partitioner) making the presumption that the partitioner for the new Range will be the same as this Range.
