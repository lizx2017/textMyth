Summary:
Can't prepare an INSERT query
Description:
Preparing an INSERT query fails with CQL3+binary protocol (maybe thrift as well, haven't checked). Preparing an equivalent UPDATE query works just fine.
demo (id int primary key, value text)
preparing "INSERT INTO test.demo (id, value) VALUES (?, ?)" -> 8704, Invalid definition for id, not a collection type
prparing "UPDATE test.demo SET value = ? WHERE id = ?" -> ok
