Summary:
"CREATE TABLE ..." execution time increases linearly with number of existing column families
Description:
During creation of 9K column families, the time to execute the "CREATE TABLE" statement increased linearly from 100ms to 15min. Tried issuing the statements using both the Java Driver (2.0.0-beta2) and cqlsh (4.1.0), with the same result.
