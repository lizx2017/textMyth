Summary:
Missing files in debian /etc/cassandra/conf folder
Description:
The standard debian installation puts;
cassandra-env.sh cassandra.yaml log4j-server.properties
into /etc/cassandra. However there seem to be additional files that might make sense there:
commitlog_archiving.properties cassandra-rackdc.properties log4j-tools.properties cassandra-topology.properties
(these are at least installed by the DSC rpm installer). So should those be added in debian or removed in rpms?
