Summary:
No client warning on tombstone threshold
Description:
It appears that a client warning is not coming back for the tombstone threshold case. The batch warning works.
Repro:
Create a data condition with tombstone_warn_threshold < tombstones < tombstone_failure_threshold
Query the row
Expected:
Warning in server log, warning returned to client
I'm basing this expectation on what I see here
Observed:
Warning in server log, no warning flag in response message.
