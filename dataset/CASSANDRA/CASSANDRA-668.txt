Summary:
long commitlog syncs can cause write pauses
Description:
on a heavily loaded system (deliberately exacerbated by running the bonnie++ i/o benchmarking tool at the same time as cassandra â€“ which might not be too far off from the environment you would see on some VPS hosts), we're seeing CL sync times of 1-5s, causing write pauses.
