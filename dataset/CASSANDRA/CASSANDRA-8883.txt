Summary:
Percentile computation should use ceil not floor in EstimatedHistogram
Description:
When computing the pcount Cassandra uses floor and the comparison with elements is >= so given a simple example of there being a total of five elements
// data
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
// offsets
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Cassandra would report the 50th percentile as 2. While 3 is the more expected value. As a comparison using numpy
import numpy as np
np.percentile(np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), 50)
==> 3.0
The percentiles was added in CASSANDRA-4022 but is now used a lot in metrics Cassandra reports. I think it should error on the side on overestimating instead of underestimating.
