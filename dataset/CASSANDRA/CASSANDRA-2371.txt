Summary:
Removed/Dead Node keeps reappearing
Description:
The removetoken option does not seem to work. The original node 10.240.50.63 comes back into the ring, even after the EC2 instance is no longer in existence. Originally I tried to add a new node 10.214.103.224 with the same token, but there were some complications with that. I have pasted below all the INFO log entries found with greping the system log files.
Seems to be a similar issue seen with http://cassandra-user-incubator-apache-org.3065146.n2.nabble.com/Ghost-node-showing-up-in-the-ring-td6198180.html
