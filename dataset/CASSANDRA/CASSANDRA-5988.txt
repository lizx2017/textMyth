Summary:
Make hint TTL customizable
Description:
Currently time to live for stored hints is hardcoded to be gc_grace_seconds. This causes problems for applications using backdated deletes as a form of optimistic locking. Hints for updates made to the same data on which delete was attempted can persist for days, making it impossible to determine if delete succeeded by doing read(ALL) after a reasonable delay. We need a way to explicitly configure hint TTL, either through schema parameter or through a yaml file.
