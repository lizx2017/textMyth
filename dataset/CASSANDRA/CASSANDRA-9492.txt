Summary:
Error message changes based on jdk used
Description:
Running the dtest cql_tests:TestCQL.validate_counter_regular test, it passes on both 2.2-HEAD and 2.1-HEAD with jdk7, but fails with jdk8. The test attempts an invalid query and expects a certain failure message. With jdk7, the error returned contains Cannot add a counter column in a non counter column family.
With jdk8 it contains Cannot add a non counter column in a counter column family.
This check is made in CFMetadata.java, and the message returned is based on the result of if (defaultValidator instanceof CounterColumnType).
