Summary:
If node fails to join a ring it will stay in joining state indefinately
Description:
While attempting to add a new node to my ring something went wrong and I had to terminate the node on ec2. After this the node keeps appearing in the ring command in "joining" state and never goes away. Per driftx on the Cassandra channel if I do a whole cluster restart it should go away, but since this is a production system this is not really possible. Additionally if I could join a node with same IP again this should go away, but being on ec2 this is not always easy. So not sure if this truly qualifies as a bug or more like a feature request, but I feel there should be a way to remove a node in any state if I wish without joining a node with same ip or doing a whole cluster restart.
