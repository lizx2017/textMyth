Summary:
Boolean constants syntax is not consistent between DDL and DML in CQL
Description:
DDL statements allow boolean constants to be either quoted or unquoted as:
CREATE KEYSPACE ks WITH replication = {'class': 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor': 1} AND durable_writes = true;
CREATE KEYSPACE ks WITH replication = {'class': 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor': 1} AND durable_writes = 'true';
While DML statements only allow unquoted boolean constants.
While this is not a big deal, it can introduce a bit of confusion for the users. Fixing this lack of syntax consistency would break the existing scripts, so that's something we might want to consider next time we'll introduce some breaking changes in CQL...
