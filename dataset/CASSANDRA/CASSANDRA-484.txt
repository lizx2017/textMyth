Summary:
subcolumn-reading code doesn't properly account for tombstoned columnfamily
Description:
mostly getColumnFamily returns null if there was no data for the query, but it can also return an empty CF if it is tombstoned. (for 0.5, consider returning empty CFs for no data so we don't have this confusion.)
