Summary:
comments and documentation for index_interval are misleading
Description:
The comments and documentation for index_interval are misleading. They state the larger the sampling the more effective the index as at the cost of space. This is true, but in the context of the configuration variable it implies the larger the setting is the larger the index is while in fact it's the opposite of that.
