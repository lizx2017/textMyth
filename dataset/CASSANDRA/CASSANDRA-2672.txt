Summary:
The class o.a.c.cql.jdbc.TypedColumn needs to be declared public
Description:
The implementation of ResultSet in the JDBC package provides a method: unwrap( Class<T> interfaceName) in order to allow some of the methods in the ResultSet implementation Class to be exposed.
The implementation currently restricts the access to only one acceptable interface: CassandraResultSet.
Two of the getters in that interface return TypedColumn which cleverly contains the "Cassandra" details of the desired column such as raw column details, and the AbstractType of the validator and the comparator among others. (Nice!) Unfortunately the TypedColumn class is not public so is it is not accessible to the callers code.
