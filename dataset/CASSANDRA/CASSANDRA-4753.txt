Summary:
Timeout reporter writes hints for the local node
Description:
MessagingService.java:330 calls StorageProxy.scheduleLocalHint() without checking if the local node is the target. This causes StorageProxy.scheduleLocalHint to throw AssertionError sometimes.
Got this error when some batches are timed out. This can happen because even local batches now go through StorageProxy.sendMessages and aren't just rm.apply()'d.
