Summary:
Compression chunk_length_kb is not correctly returned for thrift/avro
Description:
CASSANDRA-3492 fixed the interpretation of chunk_length_kb as a size in bytes but infortunately forgot to convert it back to kb when returning it for thrift/avro. In particular, this means that a describe cf would return things like chunk_length_kb: 65535.
I'm afraid that because migration uses Avro this is kind of a problem. One may have to issue an 'update column family' with the right chunk_length_kb to be sure to be in a safe place.
