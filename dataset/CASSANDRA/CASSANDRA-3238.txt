Summary:
Issue with multi region ec2 and replication updates
Description:
Using the Ec2MultiRegionSnitch and updating replication settings for a keyspace seems to cause some issues that require a rolling restart to fix. The following was observed when updating a keyspace from SimpleStrategy to NTS in a multi region environment:
All repairs would hang. Even repairs only against a keyspace that was not updated.
Reads at CL.ONE would start to go across region
After a rolling restart of the cluster, repairs started working correctly again and reads stayed local to the region.
