Summary:
cqlsh: handle timestamps outside of 1970 - 2038 range
Description:
Currently, cqlsh can't handle timestamp values that fall outside of the 1970 - 2038 range due to a python limitation with utcfromtimestamp(). This is being addressed by PYTHON-198 in the python driver. Once that's complete, we should update the bundled python driver.
