Summary:
CLONE - Once a host has been hinted to, log messages for it repeat every 10 mins even if no hints are delivered
Description:
We have "0 row" hinted handoffs every 10 minutes like clockwork. This impacts our ability to monitor the cluster by adding persistent noise in the handoff metric.
Previous mentions of this issue are here:
http://www.mail-archive.com/user@cassandra.apache.org/msg25982.html
The hinted handoffs can be scrubbed away with
nodetool -h 127.0.0.1 scrub system HintsColumnFamily
but they return after anywhere from a few minutes to multiple hours later.
These started to appear after an upgrade to 1.1.6 and haven't gone away despite rolling cleanups, rolling restarts, multiple rounds of scrubbing, etc.
A few things we've noticed about the handoffs:
1. The phantom handoff endpoint changes after a non-zero handoff comes through
2. Sometimes a non-zero handoff will be immediately followed by an "off schedule" phantom handoff to the endpoint the phantom had been using before
3. The sstable2json output seems to include multiple sub-sections for each handoff with the same "deletedAt" information.
The phantom handoff endpoint changes after a non-zero handoff comes through:
