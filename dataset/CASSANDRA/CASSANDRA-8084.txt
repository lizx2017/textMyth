Summary:
GossipFilePropertySnitch and EC2MultiRegionSnitch when used in AWS/GCE clusters doesnt use the PRIVATE IPS for Intra-DC communications - When running nodetool repair
Description:
Neither of these snitches(GossipFilePropertySnitch and EC2MultiRegionSnitch ) used the PRIVATE IPS for communication between INTRA-DC nodes in my multi-region multi-dc cluster in cloud(on both AWS and GCE) when I ran "nodetool repair -local". It works fine during regular reads.
Here are the various cluster flavors I tried and failed-
AWS + Multi-REGION + Multi-DC + GossipPropertyFileSnitch + (Prefer_local=true) in rackdc-properties file.
AWS + Multi-REGION + Multi-DC + EC2MultiRegionSnitch + (Prefer_local=true) in rackdc-properties file.
GCE + Multi-REGION + Multi-DC + GossipPropertyFileSnitch + (Prefer_local=true) in rackdc-properties file.
GCE + Multi-REGION + Multi-DC + EC2MultiRegionSnitch + (Prefer_local=true) in rackdc-properties file.
I am expecting with the above setup all of my nodes in a given DC all communicate via private ips since the cloud providers dont charge us for using the private ips and they charge for using public ips.
But they can use PUBLIC IPs for INTER-DC communications which is working as expected.
Here is a snippet from my log files when I ran the "nodetool repair -local" -

Note: The IPs its communicating is all PUBLIC Ips and it should have used the PRIVATE IPs starting with 172.x.x.x
YAML file values :
The listen address is set to: PRIVATE IP
The broadcast address is set to: PUBLIC IP
The SEEDs address is set to: PUBLIC IPs from both DCs
The SNITCHES tried: GPFS and EC2MultiRegionSnitch
RACK-DC: Had prefer_local set to true.
