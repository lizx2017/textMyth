Summary:
Some keys unreadable during compaction
Description:
Starts as part of merge commit 25be46497a8df46f05ffa102bc645bfd684ea48a
Stress will say that a key wasn't validated because it isn't returned even though it's loaded. The key will eventually appear and can be queried using cqlsh.
Reproduce with
#!/bin/sh
ROWCOUNT=10000000
SCHEMA='-col n=fixed(1) -schema compaction(strategy=LeveledCompactionStrategy) compression=LZ4Compressor'
./cassandra-stress write n=$ROWCOUNT -node xh61 -pop seq=1..$ROWCOUNT no-wrap -rate threads=25 $SCHEMA
./cassandra-stress mixed "ratio(read=2)" n=100000000 -node xh61 -pop "dist=extreme(1..$ROWCOUNT,0.6)" -rate threads=25 $SCHEMA
