Summary:
Replayed log data is not flushed before logs are wiped
Description:
The memtable created by replaying commit logs on startup is supposed to be flushed as a SSTable before the commitlog is removed, but this is not happening. So you can lose data by doing the following:
1. insert data
2. restart cassandra (using kill, to force replay)
3. restart cassandra again
