Summary:
First RepairJob unregisters RepairSession from FailureDetector
Description:
Due to CASSANDRA-3569, we unregister FD when all Merkle trees are received. Till 2.1, we do this on last repair job of a session.
In trunk(3.0), we are doing it after any one repair job has got all Merkle trees. This looks like a regression.
