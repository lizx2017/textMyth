Summary:
Followup to 6914: null handling, duplicate column in resultSet and cleanup
Description:
The patch for CASSANDRA-6914 left a few stuffs not properly handled:
A condition like IF m['foo'] = null is not handled and throw a NPE.
It's using ByteBuffer.equals() to compare 2 collection values which is generally incorrect (the actual comparator should be used).
If 2 conditions on 2 elements of the same collection were provided and the CAS failed, then the collection was duplicated in the resultSet.
The ColumnCondition.WithVariables was generally a bit inefficient/ugly: it can lead to bind multiple times the same terms which is unnecessary. It's cleaner to directly create a condition with bound values.
