Summary:
Javadoc for thrift interface is not generated
Description:
In both 0.6 and svn trunk no javadoc is generated for thrift-generated classes like org.apache.cassandra.thrift.Cassandra. The problem is that the wrong directory is included in the javadoc ant target (interface/thrift instead of interface/thrift/gen-java).
