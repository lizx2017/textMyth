Summary:
JDBC ResultSet improperly handles null column values
Description:
JDBC ResultSet getters return built-in datatypes such as int, long, short, byte, boolean that are not capable of handling a null value. As a consequence, it provides a method: wasNull which returns true if the value was null. The spec requires a zero numeric value (or false in the case of boolean ) is returned by the getter. This was being mis-handled and a null value was being cast (boxed) to the return value. An NPE would result.
