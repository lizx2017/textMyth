Summary:
RecentBloomFilterFalseRatio and RecentBloomFilterFalsePositives reset each other
Description:
If either of the ColumnFamily JMX attributes RecentBloomFilterFalseRatio or RecentBloomFilterFalsePositives are read, both are reset. This means if you try to read both attributes at the same time (like jconsole does, for example), one of them is guaranteed to be 0.
The solution might be that we store a separate false positives counter for the ratio and the normal count and reset them separately. Some refactoring should be done at the same time so that the BloomFilterTracker calculates the false positive ratio itself instead of having DataTracker fetch both counters and calculate the ratio.
On a related note, why does nodetool not use the Recent versions of the bloom filter metrics?
