Summary:
Debian init script broken
Description:
The debian init script released in 2.0.1 contains 2 issues:
The pidfile directory is not created if it doesn't already exist.
Classpath not exported to the start-stop-daemon.
These lead to the init script not picking up jna.jar, or anything from the debian EXTRA_CLASSPATH environment variable, and the init script not being able to stop/restart Cassandra.
