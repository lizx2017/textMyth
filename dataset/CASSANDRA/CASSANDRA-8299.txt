Summary:
cassandra-stress unique keys
Description:
In the old stress tool you could use -n 10000 and get 10000 unique keys in the keyspace.
In the new stress tool there doesn't seem to be a way to do this. For example if I have the following definition:
table_definition: |
CREATE TABLE table(
key uuid PRIMARY KEY,
col1 text,
col2 text,
col3 text
) WITH comment='A table'
Column Distribution Specifications ###
columnspec:
name: key
size: fixed(36)
population: uniform(1..100B)
name: col1
size: fixed(100)
name: col2
size: fixed(100)
name: col3
size: fixed(100)
and then run
cassandra-stress user n=10000 profile=stress.yaml ops(insert=1)
If you look at the keyspace was only 59000 keys. The new tool needs to be able to generated unique ids. In our tested we want to see how the number of keys effects the cluster when doing queries.
