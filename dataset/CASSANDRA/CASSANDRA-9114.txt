Summary:
cqlsh: Formatting of map contents broken
Description:
In CASSANDRA-9081, we upgraded the bundled python driver to version 2.5.0. This upgrade changed the class that's used for map collections, and we failed to add a new formatting adaptor for the new class.
This was causing the cqlsh_tests.TestCqlsh.test_eat_glass dtest to fail.
