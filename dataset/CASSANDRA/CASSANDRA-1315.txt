Summary:
ColumnFamilyOutputFormat should use client API objects
Description:
ColumnFamilyOutputFormat currently takes IColumns as its input, meaning that users need to understand Cassandra's internals reasonably well in order to use it, and need to hardcode things like the comparator type and clock type into their MapReduce jobs.
Instead, CFOutputFormat should take either Thrift or Avro objects, which are familiar interfaces for users.
