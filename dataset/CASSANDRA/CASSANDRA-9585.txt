Summary:
Make "truncate table X" an alias for "truncate X"
Description:
CQL syntax is inconsistent: it's "drop table X" but "truncate X". It used to trip me up all the time until I wrapped my brain around this inconsistency and it still triggers a tiny bout of OCD every time I type it. I realize it's too late to change it, but why not have both? "truncate table X" is also consistent with the syntax in SQL.
