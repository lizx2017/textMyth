Summary:
New versions of Hotspot create new Class objects on every JMX connection causing the heap to fill up with them if CMSClassUnloadingEnabled isn't set.
Description:
Newer versions of Oracle's Hotspot JVM , post 6u43 (maybe earlier) and 7u25 (maybe earlier), are experiencing issues with GC and JMX where heap slowly fills up overtime until OOM or a full GC event occurs, specifically when CMS is leveraged. Adding:
JVM_OPTS="$JVM_OPTS -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled"
The the options in cassandra-env.sh alleviates the problem.
