Summary:
cqlsh tab completion error in "CREATE KEYSPACE"
Description:
The following:
cqlsh> CREATE KEYSPACE test WITH strategy_class = 'S<TAB>
will tab complete like this:
cqlsh> CREATE KEYSPACE test WITH strategy_class = 'SimpleStrategy '
Note the extra space after SimpleStrategy. Not a big deal to remove, but it could be misleading to people.
