Summary:
cql3 doesn't support multiple clauses on primary key components
Description:
In trying to write a dtest for CASSANDRA-5225, I noticed that given a table such as:
CREATE TABLE foo (
  key text,
  c text,
  v text,
  PRIMARY KEY (key, c)
)
It is possible to slice the values of 1 or 2 for c:
select c from foo where key = 'foo' and c > '0' and c < '3';
However, there is no way to get these explicitly by name, even though it should be possible:
cqlsh:Keyspace1> select c from foo where key = 'foo' and c in ('1', '2');
Bad Request: PRIMARY KEY part c cannot be restricted by IN relation
