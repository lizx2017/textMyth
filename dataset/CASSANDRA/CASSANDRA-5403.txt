Summary:
Clean up ColumnFamily, ISortedColumns heirarchy
Description:
CF wraps ISC but adds no real functionality of its own (post-supercolumn cleanup).
This means that we're wasting allocations every time we create a CF/ISC pair when really one would do.
Other things that would be nice to clean up:
We often create an empty CF as a placeholder that should not be modified, and rely on convention to avoid such modification. We could enforce this with a new CF/ISC subclass.
Many places still use TMBSC where ABSC would be adequate and cheaper
Other places still (ModificationStatement; others?) would be fine using a column container with no sorting requirement at all
