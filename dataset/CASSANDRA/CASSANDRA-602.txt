Summary:
bytesToHex broken for small byte values
Description:
FBUtilities.bytesToHex uses Integer.toHexString, which does not zero-pad its output. We then assert in hexToBytes that each byte string is 2 characters long.
The assertion will occasionally fail, but oftentimes, we simple end up with a different byte value than we started with.
