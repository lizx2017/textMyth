Summary:
DEB package missing dependency
Description:
The DEB installer at http://www.apache.org/dist/cassandra/debian 10x main should include libcap2 as a dependency. Without libcap installed, the daemon fails to start, generating the following error:
failed loading capabilities library -- libcap.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory.
Cannot set group id for user 'cassandra'
set_user_group failed for user 'cassandra'
Service exit with a return value of 4
