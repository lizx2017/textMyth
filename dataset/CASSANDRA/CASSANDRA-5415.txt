Summary:
Batch with timestamp failed
Description:
When I create a prepared statement with the following CQL3 using Thrift protocol:
BEGIN BATCH USING TIMESTAMP <number>
<some INSERT INTO or UPDATE statements ....>
APPLY BATCH
and execute this statement in a loop, I randomly get the error:
InvalidRequestException(why:Timestamp must be set either on BATCH or individual statements)
All statements inside the batch have no individual USING TIMESTAMP.
