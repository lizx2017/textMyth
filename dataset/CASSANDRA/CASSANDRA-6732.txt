Summary:
Cross DC writes not compatible 1.2->1.1 during rolling upgrade
Description:
During a rolling upgrade from 1.1.12 to 1.2.15 one DC at a time only 1/3 of the writes to the first DC to be upgraded actually make it to the other DC, and LOTS of hints attempt to get made.
Looks like the header for forwarded writes changed from 1.1->1.2 so the 1.1 nodes can't read it.
