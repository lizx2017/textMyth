Summary:
CassandraStorage erroring due to system keyspace schema changes
Description:
CassandraStorage will be deprecated in 3.0, but is currently not working because it is selecting key_aliases from the system.schema_columnfamilies table, and the column no longer exists. This is causing about half of the pig-tests to fail.
