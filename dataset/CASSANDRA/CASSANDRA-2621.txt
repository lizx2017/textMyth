Summary:
sub columns under deleted CF returned
Description:
found when working on CASSANDRA-2590
In some cases sub columns are not filtered to check if they have a higher timestamp than and container super column or CF. For example a super col with two two columns, one with timestamp 0 and the other 5, will be returned with all columns even if there is a row delete at timestamp 2.
If the QueryFilter is created with a null superColumnName in the QueryPath it will not filter the sub columns.
IdentityQueryFilter.filterSuperColumn() lets all sub columns through. NamesQueryFilter.filterSubColumn() and SliceQueryFilter() check that each sub column is relavent.
I have a fix and am working on some test cases.
