Summary:
SSTableDeletingReference only deletes data files
Description:
Ching-Cheng Chen reports on the mailing list:
In SSTableDeletingReference, it try this operation
components.remove(Component.DATA);
before
STable.delete(desc, components);
However, the components was reference to the components object which was created inside SSTable by
this.components = Collections.unmodifiableSet(dataComponents);
As you can see, you can't try the remove operation on that components object.
