Summary:
CQL3: fix index dropping and assign default name if none provided at index creation
Description:
This ticket proposes to fix two problems of CQL3 index handling:
DROP INDEX is broken (because the code forgot to clone the metadata before doing modification which break the schema update path)
If an index is created with a name (which CREATE INDEX allow), there is no way to drop the index (note that we will internally assign a name to the index ColumnFamilyStore, but we don't assign a name in the ColumnDefinition object, which is the only one checked by DROP INDEX).
