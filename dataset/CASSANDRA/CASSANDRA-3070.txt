Summary:
counter repair
Description:
Hi!
We have some counters out of sync but repair doesn't sync values.
We tried nodetool repair.
We use LOCAL_QUORUM for read. A repair row mutation is sent to other nodes while reading a bad row but counters wasn't repaired by mutation.
Output of two nodes were uploaded. (Some new debug messages were added.)
