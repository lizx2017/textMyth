Summary:
Adding another datacenter's node results in 0 rows returned on first datacenter
Description:
On Cassandra-1.0.5:
1. Create a node in C* with a fresh installation and create a keyspace on that node with one column family -
CREATE KEYSPACE test
WITH placement_strategy = 'SimpleStrategy'
and strategy_options=
{replication_factor:1}
;
use test;
create column family cf1;
2. Insert values into cf1 -
set cf1[ascii('k')][ascii('c')] = ascii('v');
get cf1[ascii('k')];
=> (column=63, value=v, timestamp=1325689630397000)
Returned 1 results.
3. update the strategy options from simple to networktopology with
{Cassandra:1, Backup:1}

4. read from cf1 to make sure the options change doesn't affect anything -
consistencylevel as LOCAL_QUORUM;
get cf1[ascii('k')];
=> (column=63, value=v, timestamp=1325689630397000)
Returned 1 results.
5. start a second node in the Backup datacenter
6. read from cf1 again (on the first node) -
consistencylevel as LOCAL_QUORUM;
get cf1[ascii('k')];
Returned 0 results.
After about 60 seconds, "get cf1[ascii('k')]" started to return results again.
Also, when running at a CL of ONE on 1.0's head, we were able to see issues as well.
But, if more than one node was added to the second datacenter, then replication_strategy is changed, it seems okay.
