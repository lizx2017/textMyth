Summary:
stress tool hangs forever on timeout or error
Description:
The stress tool hangs forever if it encounters a timeout or exception. CTRL-C will kill it if run from a terminal, but when running it from a script (like a dtest) it hangs the script forever. It would be great for scripting it if a reasonable error code was returned when things go wrong.
To duplicate, clear out /var/lib/cassandra and then run "stress --operation=READ".
