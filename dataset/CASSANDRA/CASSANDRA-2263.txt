Summary:
cql driver jar
Description:
Work was done in CASSANDRA-1848 to create a jar for the CQL Java driver. The generated Thrfit code was broken out into it's own jar as well, since that is a dependency for both servers and clients. However, based on the work currently happening in CASSANDRA-2262 and CASSANDRA-2124, it seems that additional dependencies will exist, and new jar(s) will need to be created.
The easiest way to fix this will probably be to put copies of all of o.a.c.db.marshal and o.a.c.utils, and a copy of o.a.c.config.ConfigurationException into the CQL driver jar (a split along those lines to create another jar doesn't make sense IMO).
