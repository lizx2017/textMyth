Summary:
Discard pooled readers for cold data
Description:
Reader pooling was introduced in CASSANDRA-4942 but pooled RandomAccessReaders are never cleaned up until the SSTableReader is closed. So memory use is "the worst case simultaneous RAR we had open for this file, forever."
We should introduce a global limit on how much memory to use for RAR, and evict old ones.
