"Expected both token and generation columns"
Description:
From the mailing list:
ERROR 16:14:35,975 Exception encountered during startup.
java.lang.RuntimeException: Expected both token and generation columns; found ColumnFamily(LocationInfo [Generation:false:4@4,])

Exception encountered during startup.
Separately, the same user wrote: "I added a server to my cluster. It had some junk in the system/LocationInfo files from previous, unsuccessful attempts to add the server to the cluster. (They were unsuccessful because I hadn't opened the port on that computer.)"
Perhaps that is why it was able to create the Generation column but not the Token?
