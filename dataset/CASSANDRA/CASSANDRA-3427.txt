Summary:
CompressionMetadata is not shared across threads, we create a new one for each read
Description:
The CompressionMetada holds the compressed block offsets in memory. Without being absolutely huge, this is still of non-negligible size as soon as you have a bit of data in the DB. Reallocating this for each read is a very bad idea.
Note that this only affect range queries, since "normal" queries uses CompressedSegmentedFile that does reuse a unique CompressionMetadata instance.
