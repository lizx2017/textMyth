Summary:
DISTINCT queries with LIMITs or paging are incorrect when partitions are deleted
Description:
Using paging demo code from https://github.com/PatrickCallaghan/datastax-paging-demo
The code creates and populates a table with 1000 entries and pages through them with setFetchSize set to 100. If we then delete one entry with 'cqlsh':
cqlsh:datastax_paging_demo> delete from datastax_paging_demo.products  where productId = 'P142'; (The specified productid is number 6 in the resultset.)
and run the same query ("Select * from") again we get:
[com.datastax.paging.Main.main()] INFO  com.datastax.paging.Main - Paging demo took 0 secs. Total Products : 999
which is what we would expect.
If we then change the "select" statement in dao/ProductDao.java (line 70) from "Select * from " to "Select DISTINCT productid from " we get this result:
[com.datastax.paging.Main.main()] INFO  com.datastax.paging.Main - Paging demo took 0 secs. Total Products : 99
So it looks like the tombstone stops the paging behaviour. Is this a bug?
