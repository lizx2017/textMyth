Summary:
Update read paths to ensure ColumnFamilyStore.removeDeleted is called
Description:
In some cases, RowIteratorFactory's getReduced calls the filter.collateColumns path and doesn't remove columns TTL-ed out (by CASSANDRA-3974).
Sylvain suggested that we should put removeDeleted on every read path, making it the only method concerned with tombstone and CF-TTL checks. He also suggested that QueryFilter.isRelelevant might then be able to be removed.
See comments in CASSANDRA-3974 for more information.
