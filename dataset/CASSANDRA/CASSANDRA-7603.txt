Summary:
cqlsh fails to decode blobs
Description:
As described in PYTHON-101, cqlsh patches the python driver's deserialization method for BytesType for formatting purposes. When the bundled driver was upgraded to 2.1, the patch was not updated to match, resulting in an error like this:
cqlsh:unicode> select * from test;
Traceback (most recent call last):
