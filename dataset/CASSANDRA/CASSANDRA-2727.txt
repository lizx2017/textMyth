Summary:
examples/hadoop_word_count reducer to cassandra doesn't output into the output_words cf
Description:
I tried the examples/hadoop_word_count example and could output to the filesystem but when I output to cassandra (the default), nothing shows up in output_words. I can output to cassandra using pig so I think the problem is isolated to this example.
