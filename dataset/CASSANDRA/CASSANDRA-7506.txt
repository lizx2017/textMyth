Summary:
querying secondary index using complete collection should warn/error
Description:
Cassandra does not seem to support querying a set literal like so:
select * from testtable where pkey='foo' and mycollection = {'one', 'two'};
We currently don't let the user know this query is problematic, rather we just return no rows.
To reproduce:
create keyspace test with replication = {'class': 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor':1} ;

use test ;

create table testtable (pkey text PRIMARY KEY, mycollection set<text>);

create index on testtable (mycollection);

insert into testtable (pkey, mycollection) VALUES ( 'foo', {'one','two'};

cqlsh:test> select * from testtable where pkey='foo' and mycollection = {'one', 'two'};

(0 rows)
