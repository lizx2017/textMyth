Summary:
CQL3: create table don't always validate access to the right keyspace
Description:
Create table allows (like other queries) to override the currently set keyspace (CREATE TABLE foo.bar ...). However, when we do that, the access check is done on the wrong keyspace. In particular if no keyspace was set, this end up in a NPE.
