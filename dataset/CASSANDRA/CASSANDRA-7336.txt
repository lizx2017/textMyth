Summary:
RepairTask doesn't send a correct message in a JMX notifcation in case of IllegalArgumentException
Description:
From CASSANDRA-7317:
The behavior when manually trying to repair the full range of 127.0.0.01 definitely needs improvement though.
Repair command:
[Nicks-MacBook-Pro:21:50:44 cassandra-2.0] cassandra$ bin/nodetool -p 7100 repair -st -10 -et -9223372036854775808 system_traces
[2014-05-28 21:50:55,803] Starting repair command #17, repairing 1 ranges for keyspace system_traces
[2014-05-28 21:50:55,804] Starting repair command #17, repairing 1 ranges for keyspace system_traces
[2014-05-28 21:50:55,804] Repair command #17 finished
[Nicks-MacBook-Pro:21:50:56 cassandra-2.0] cassandra$ echo $?
1
system.log:
ERROR [Thread-96] 2014-05-28 21:40:05,921 StorageService.java (line 2621) Repair session failed:
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Requested range intersects a local range but is not fully contained in one; this would lead to imprecise repair
The actual output of the repair command doesn't really indicate that there was an issue. Although the command does return with a non zero exit status.
The error here is invisible if you are using the synchronous jmx repair api. It will appear as though the repair completed successfully.
