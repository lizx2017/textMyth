Summary:
leveled compaction does less work in L0 than intended
Description:
We have this code in the candidate loop:
.               if (SSTable.getTotalBytes(candidates) > maxSSTableSizeInBytes)
                {
                    // add sstables from L1 that overlap candidates
                    candidates.addAll(overlapping(candidates, generations[1]));
                    break;
                }
thus, as soon as we have enough to compact to make one L1 sstable's worth of data, we stop collecting candidates.
