Summary:
CassandraStorage allow_deletes doesn't work in Hadoop cluster
Description:
When using CassandraStorage in a Pig script that runs in a Hadoop cluster, the environment variable configuration option for allow_deletes doesn't work. I'd like to see allow_deletes added as a URL parameter.
For example, I'd like to do
STORE storable_events INTO 'cassandra://drlcrs/event?allow_deletes=true' USING org.apache.cassandra.hadoop.pig.CassandraStorage();
