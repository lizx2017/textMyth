Summary:
java.io.IOException: Could not get input splits
Description:
see http://www.mail-archive.com/user@cassandra.apache.org/msg32414.html
I've noticed that if I restart Cassandra I get more errors for the first minutes, although it's accessible through cqlsh without issue.
I have tested on a 1-node (Osx Laptop) and 4-nodes (Ubuntu servers) and got the same error. I tried with version 1.2.6, 1.2.8, 1.2.9, 1.2.10 without success
