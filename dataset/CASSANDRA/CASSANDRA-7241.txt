Summary:
Pig test fails on 2.1 branch
Description:
run ant pig-test on cassandra-2.1 branch. There are many tests failed. I trace it a little and find out Pig test fails starts from https://github.com/apache/cassandra/commit/362cc05352ec67e707e0ac790732e96a15e63f6b
commit.
It looks like storage changes break Pig tests.
