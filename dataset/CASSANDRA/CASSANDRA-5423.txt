Summary:
PasswordAuthenticator is incompatible with various Cassandra clients
Description:
Evidently with the old authenticator it was allowed to set keyspace, and then login. With the org.apache.cassandra.auth.PasswordAuthenticator you have to login and then setkeyspace
For backwards compatibility it would be good to allow setting before login, and perform the actual operation/validation later after the login.
