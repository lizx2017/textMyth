Summary:
Add a close() method to CRAR to prevent leaking file descriptors.
Description:
The problem is that under heavy load Finalizer daemon is unable to keep up with number of "source" and "channel" fields from CRAR to finalize (as FileInputStream has custom finalize() which calls close inside) which creates memory/cpu pressure on the machine.
