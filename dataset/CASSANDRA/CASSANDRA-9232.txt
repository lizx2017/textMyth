Summary:
"timestamp" is considered as a reserved keyword in cqlsh completion
Description:
cqlsh seems to treat "timestamp" as a reserved keyword when used as an identifier:
cqlsh:ks1> create table t1 (int int primary key, ascii ascii, bigint bigint, blob blob, boolean boolean, date date, decimal decimal, double double, float float, inet inet, text text, time time, timestamp timestamp, timeuuid timeuuid, uuid uuid, varchar varchar, varint varint);
Leads to the following completion when building an INSERT statement:
cqlsh:ks1> insert into t1 (int, 
"timestamp" ascii       bigint      blob        boolean     date        decimal     double      float       inet        text        time        timeuuid    uuid        varchar     varint
"timestamp" is a keyword but not a reserved one and should therefore not be proposed as a quoted string. It looks like this error happens only for timestamp. Not a big deal of course, but it might be worth reviewing the keywords treated as reserved in cqlsh, especially with the many changes introduced in 3.0.
