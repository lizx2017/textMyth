Summary:
range scan doesn't repair missing rows
Description:
Range scans do not do digest queries but they do compare all the replicas they receive and repair any discrepancies in the background. (Thus, to get comparable behavior to normal read repair, CL.ALL must be used.)
The bug is that currently, replicas that omit a row entirely will be ignored and that row will not be sent to them.
