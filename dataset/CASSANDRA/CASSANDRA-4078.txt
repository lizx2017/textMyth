Summary:
StackOverflowError when upgrading to 1.0.8 from 0.8.10
Description:
Hello
I am trying to upgrade our 1-node setup from 0.8.10 to 1.0.8 and seeing the following exception when starting up 1.0.8. We have been running 0.8.10 without any issues.
Attached is the entire log file during startup of 1.0.8. There are 2 exceptions:
1. StackOverflowError (line 2599)
2. InstanceAlreadyExistsException (line 3632)
I tried "run scrub" under 0.8.10 first, it did not help. Also, I tried dropping the column family which caused the exception, it just got the same exceptions from another column family.
Thanks
