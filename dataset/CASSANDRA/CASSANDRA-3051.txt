Summary:
On Disk Compression breaks SSL Encryption
Description:
Encryption depends on FileStreamTask.write [1] protected member to be called because the SSLFileStreamTask.write overrides this to write back to the server.
When enabled, compression circumvents the call and the client does not communicate using an SSL socket back to the server.
