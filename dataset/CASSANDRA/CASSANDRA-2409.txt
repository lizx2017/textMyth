Summary:
Add INSERT support to CQL
Description:
There are two reasons to support INSERT:
It helps new users feel comfortable (everyone's first statement will be to try to INSERT something, we should make that a positive experience instead of slapping them)
Even though it is synonymous with update it is still useful in your code to have both to help communicate intent, similar to choosing good variable names
The only downside is explaining how INSERT isn't a "true" insert because it doesn't error out if the row already exists â€“ but we already have to explain that same concept for UPDATE; the cognitive load is extremely minor.
