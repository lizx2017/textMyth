Summary:
Don't exchange schema between nodes with different versions (no pull, no push)
Description:
Subject. Don't push schema to unknown-, or differently major-versioned nodes, and don't pull schema from them, either.
Since we don't support schema altering during upgrade, and adding nodes during cluster upgrades is also a non-recommended thing, this is what we are going to do.
Until CASSANDRA-6038, that is.
