Summary:
Run LCS for both repaired and unrepaired data
Description:
If a user has leveled compaction configured, we should run that for both the unrepaired and the repaired data. I think this would make things a lot easier for end users
It would simplify migration to incremental repairs as well, if a user runs incremental repair on its nice leveled unrepaired data, we wont need to drop it all to L0, instead we can just start moving sstables from the unrepaired leveling straight into the repaired leveling
Idea could be to have two instances of LeveledCompactionStrategy and move sstables between the instances after an incremental repair run (and let LCS be totally oblivious to whether it handles repaired or unrepaired data). Same should probably apply to any compaction strategy, run two instances and remove all repaired/unrepaired logic from the strategy itself.
