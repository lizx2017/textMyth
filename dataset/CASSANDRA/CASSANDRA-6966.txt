Summary:
Errors with Super Columns, mixup of 1.2 and 2.0
Description:
On our test cluster, we tried a upgrade of Cassandra from 1.2.11 to 2.0.6. During the time we were running with 2 different versions of cassandra, there was errors in the logs:
ERROR [WRITE-/10.10.0.41] 2014-03-19 11:23:27,523 OutboundTcpConnection.java (line 234) error writing to /10.10.0.41
java.lang.RuntimeException: Cannot convert filter to old super column format. Update all nodes to Cassandra 2.0 first.

I confirm we do have old style super columns which were designed when cassandra was 1.0.x.
Since in our test cluster the replication factor is 1, I can see errors on the client side, since 1 node among 2 was down. So I don't know for sure if this error in cassandra affected the client, the time frame is too short to be sure from the logs.
