Summary:
COPY command does not work properly with collections causing failure to import data
Description:
The COPY command does not properly format collections in the output CSV - to be able to re-import the data.
Here is how you can replicate the problem:
CREATE TABLE user_colors ( 
user_id int PRIMARY KEY, 
colors list<ascii> 
);

UPDATE user_colors SET colors = ['red','blue'] WHERE user_id=5; 
UPDATE user_colors SET colors = ['purple','yellow'] WHERE user_id=6; 
UPDATE user_colors SET colors = ['black''] WHERE user_id=7;

COPY user_colors (user_id, colors) TO 'output.csv';

CREATE TABLE user_colors2 ( 
user_id int PRIMARY KEY, 
colors list<ascii> 
);

COPY user_colors2 (user_id, colors ) FROM 'user_colors.csv';
Bad Request: line 1:68 no viable alternative at input ']'
Aborting import at record #0 (line 1). Previously-inserted values still present.
0 rows imported in 0.007 seconds.
The CSV file seems to be malformed
The single quotes within the collection are missing
The double quotes for collection on user_id=7 are missing and causing COPY to fail.
5,"[red, blue]"
7,[black]
6,"[purple, yellow]"
Should be like this
5,"['red', 'blue']"
7,"['black']"
6,"['purple', 'yellow']"
Once the file is changed, the import works
COPY user_colors2 (user_id, colors ) FROM 'user_colors.csv';
3 rows imported in 0.012 seconds.
SELECT * FROM user_colors2;

 user_id | colors
---------+------------------
       5 |      [red, blue]
       7 |          [black]
       6 | [purple, yellow]
