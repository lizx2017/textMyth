Summary:
Data loss after moving tokens
Description:
The dtest topology_test:TestTopology.movement_test is failing on 2.1.0 and 2.1-HEAD. The test, which has been attached, goes through the following workflow:
Create an unbalanced three node cluster without vnodes
Create a keyspace with RF=1
Load data into the cluster
Flush the cluster with nodetool flush
Move the tokens around to balance the cluster, using nodetool move
Run nodetool cleanup
At this point, the test checks that all 10,000 of the originally inserted rows are still there. In 2.0.10 that is true, however in 2.1, only ~4000 rows exist.
