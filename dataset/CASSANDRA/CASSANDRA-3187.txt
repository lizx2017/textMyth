Summary:
Return both listen_address and rpc_address through describe_ring
Description:
CASSANDRA-1777 changed describe_ring to return the rpc address associated with a node instead of the listen_address. This allows using different interfaces for listen_address and rpc_address, but breaks when rpc_address is set to something like 0.0.0.0.
I think the describe_ring should just return both interfaces. We can add an optional field to the TokenRange struct that is 'listen_endpoints' or something similar and populate that with the listen addresses of nodes.
