Summary:
Upgrading to cassandra-1.2 with a dead LEFT state from 1.1 causes problems
Description:
In 1.1, we wrote LEFT states as LEFT,token,expiretime in gossip. However in 1.2, VersionValue serializes this to LEFT,expiretime,tokens and causes the upgrade 1.2 to try and parse it this way as well, causing it to try to parse the token as an expiretime.
Another wrinkle to this is assassinate still writes it the old way: LEFT,tokens,expiretime.
