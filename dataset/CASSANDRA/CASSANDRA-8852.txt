Summary:
Stream throttling mixes up bits & bytes
Description:
The throttling of the streaming doesn't work the way it's intended. If you set streamThroughputOutboundMegabitsPerSec to 1, the ratelimiter rate is set to 1024*1024*8. Which means your allowing 8 megabyte/second throughput, not 1/8 megabyte/second as intended.
