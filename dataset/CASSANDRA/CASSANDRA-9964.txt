Summary:
Document post-2.1 caching table options syntax
Description:
CASSANDRA-5357 added new syntax for caching for CREATE TABLE in 2.1, but documentation hasn't been updated accordingly.
Now that the old options are gone completely after CASSANDRA-9712, we must update the CQL spec.
DS Docs have been up to date for a while.
