Summary:
Bootstrap breaks data stored (missing rows, extra rows, column values modified)
Description:
Scenario:
Two fresh (empty /data /commitog /saved_caches dirs) cassandra installs.
Start first one.
Run data inserting program [1], run again in verify mode - all data intact.
Bootstrap 2nd node.
Run verification again, now it fails.
Issue is very strange to me as cassandra works perfectly for me when cluster nodes stay the same for days now but any bootstrap ( 1 > 2 nodes, 2 -> 3 nodes, 2>3 nodes RF=2) breaks data.
I am running cassandra with 1GB heap size, 32bit userland on 64bit kernels, not sure what else could matter there.
Any hints ?
Thanks in advance, regards.
[1] simple program generating data and later verifying data.
