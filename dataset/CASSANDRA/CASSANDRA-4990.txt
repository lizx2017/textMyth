Summary:
Do not allow use of collection with compact storage
Description:
You can define ColumnFamily with collection type and compact storage as follows:
CREATE TABLE test (
  user ascii PRIMARY KEY,
  mails list<text>
) WITH COMPACT STORAGE;
This does not make sense and end up error when inserting data to collection.
INSERT INTO test (user, mails) VALUES ('foo', ['foo@foo.org']);
I think it is better not to allow defining such ColumnFamily.
