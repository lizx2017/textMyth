Summary:
Expring columns can expire between the two phase of LazilyCompactedRow.
Description:
LazilyCompactedRow reads the columns to compact twice. First to create the index, bloom filter and calculate the data size, and then another phase to actually write the columns. But a column can expire between those two phase, which will result in a bad data size in the sstable (and a possibly corrupted row index).
