Summary:
Cassandra 1.2 should not accept CQL version "3.0.0-beta1"
Description:
During Cassandra 1.1's whole lifecycle, the CREATE KEYSPACE syntax was pretty dramatically and incompatibly different from what is there now for 1.2. That's ok, since we explicitly said there could be breaking changes in the syntax before 3.0.0 final, but at least we should make it clear that 3.0.0 is not compatible with the 3.0.0-beta1 syntax we had out for quite a while.
If we don't want to reject connections asking for 3.0.0-beta1, we should bump the version number to 3.0.1 or something.
