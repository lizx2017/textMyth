Summary:
isRunning flag set prematurely in org.apache.cassandra.transport.Server
Description:
In org.apache.cassandra.transport.Server, the start() method sets the isRunning flag before calling the run() method. In the event of an initialization error like a port conflict an exception will be thrown at line 136 which is,
Channel channel = bootstrap.bind(socket);
It seems like it might make more sense to set the isRunning flag after binding to the socket. I have a tool that deploys a node and then verifies it is ready to receive CQL requests. I do this via JMX. Unless I use a delay before making that check, the JMX call will return true even though there is a port conflict.
