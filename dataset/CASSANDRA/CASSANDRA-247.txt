Summary:
Thrift interface uses reserved keyword "end"
Description:
The definition for get_slice_by_name_range has an argument named "end".
According to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/THRIFT-434, this will soon become an illegal keyword in Thrift definitions due to its use as a reserved keyword in Ruby.
Currently, attempting to use the Ruby interface results in syntax errors unless the interface definition is changed prior to generation.
