Summary:
BytesType and batch mutate causes encoded bytes of non-printable characters to be dropped
Description:
When running the two tests, individual column insert works with the values generated. However, batch insert with the same values causes an encoding failure on the key. It appears bytes are dropped from the end of the byte array that represents the key value. See the attached unit test
