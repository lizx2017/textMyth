Summary:
Broken default values for min/max timestamp
Description:
When the SStableMetadata are not present (or are too hold), the default for the min and max timestamp used is not always correct. Namely, the default (i.e. when we don't know anything) for the min timestamp should be MIN_VALUE and the max timestamp should be MAX_VALUE.
And there is 2 places where we need to apply those default:
if the metadata is an old one that don't have the info
if we don't have any metadata component at all
The only default that is correct is the case fixed by CASSANDRA-5153, but even then it missed a number of occurrences of the problem.
