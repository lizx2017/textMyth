Summary:
Fix 2.0 key and column aliases serialization and cqlsh DESC SCHEMA
Description:
CASSANDRA-5125 made a slight change to how key_aliases and column_aliases are serialized in schema. Prior to that we never kept nulls in the the json pseudo-lists. This does break cqlsh and probably breaks 1.2 nodes receiving such migrations as well. The patch reverts this behavior and also slightly modifies cqlsh itself to ignore non-regular columns from system.schema_columns table.
This patch breaks nothing, since 2.0 already handles 1.2 non-null padded alias lists.
