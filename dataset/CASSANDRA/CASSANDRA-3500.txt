Summary:
cqlsh ASSUME doesn't work when using SELECT keyspace.cfname syntax
Description:
After assigning an ASSUME type to some columnfamily CF in keyspace K, if a SELECT is subsequently done on CF while the session is using a different keyspace, the ASSUME does not take effect:
cqlsh> USE ks;
cqlsh:ks> CREATE COLUMNFAMILY cf (key int PRIMARY KEY, col int);
cqlsh:ks> INSERT INTO cf (key, col) VALUES (99, 1633837924);
cqlsh:ks> ASSUME cf(col) VALUES ARE ascii;
cqlsh:ks> SELECT * FROM cf;
 KEY |  col |
  99 | abcd |

cqlsh:ks> USE system;
cqlsh:system> SELECT * FROM ks.cf;
 KEY |        col |
  99 | 1633837924 |
the output from both {{SELECT}}s there should be the same.
