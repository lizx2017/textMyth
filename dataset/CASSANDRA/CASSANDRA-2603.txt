Summary:
node stuck in 'Down' in nodetool ring, until disablegossip/enablegossip flapped it back into submission
Description:
Cluster with 0.7.4 and 9 machines. I was doing rolling restarts so nodes were expected to have flappted up/down a bit.
After cleanup, I noticed that one of the nodes 'nodetool ring' claimed that another node was Down. I'll call the node that considered the other one to be down "UpNode" and the node that was considered down "DownNode".
DownNode was the next successor on the ring relative to UpNode. Only UpNode thought it was down; all others members of the clusters agreed it was up. This stayed the case for almost 24 hours.
In system.log on UpNode, it is clearly visible that DownNode flapped to state UP recently with no notification of flapping to state DOWN afterwards. Yet 'nodetool ring' reported Down.
Today, I did disablegossip+wait-for-a-bit+enablegossip on DownNode. This caused 'nodetool ring' on UpNode to again reflect reality that DownNode is in fact up.
I do not have a reproducable test case but wanted to file it since I don't remember seeing, and didn't easily find, a JIRA bug indicating a bug with this effect has recently been fixed.
