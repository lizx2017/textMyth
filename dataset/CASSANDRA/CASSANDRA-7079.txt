Summary:
allow filtering within wide row
Description:
Let's say I have a table with wide rows.
CREATE TABLE relation (
u1 bigint,
u2 bigint,
f boolean,
PRIMARY KEY (u1, u2));
Usually I need to retrieve the whole row:
select * from relation where u1 = ?;
But sometimes I just need the relations within u1 with f = true.
By now I can't perform the following without creating an index which will degrade write performance:
select * from relation where u1 = ? and f=true allow filtering;
So now I filter rows on server side which means more network traffic and I don't know how much more server resources. Filtering rows in this case on a server side looks like nothing hard.
