Summary:
Digest mismatch doesn't wait for writes as intended
Description:
As reported by Niklas Ekström on the dev list:
I’m looking in the file StorageProxy.java (Cassandra 1.1.5), and line 766 seems odd to me.
FBUtilities.waitOnFutures() is called with the repairResults from the RowRepairResolver resolver.
The problem though is that repairResults is only assigned when the object is created at line 737 in StorageProxy.java, and there it is assigned to Collections.emptyList(), and in the resolve() method in RowRepairResolver, which is indirectly called from line 771 in StorageProxy.java, that is, after the call to FBUtilities.waitOnFutures().
So the effect is that line 766 in StorageProxy.java is essentially a no-op.
