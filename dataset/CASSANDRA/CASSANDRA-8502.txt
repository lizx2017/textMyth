Summary:
Static columns returning null for pages after first
Description:
When paging is used for a query containing a static column, the first page contains the right value for the static column, but subsequent pages have null null for the static column instead of the expected value.
Repro steps:
Create a table with a static column
Create a partition with 500 cells
Using cqlsh, query that partition
Actual result:
You will see that first, the static column appears as expected, but if you press a key after "--MORE--", the static columns will appear as null.
See the attached file for a repro of the output.
I am using a single node cluster.
