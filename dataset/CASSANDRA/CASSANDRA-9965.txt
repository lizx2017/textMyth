Summary:
Add new JMX methods to change local compaction strategy
Description:
ColumnFamilyStore.setCompactionStrategyClass() should get the same treatment wrt JMX/schema switches that enabled got in CASSANDRA-9899.
It should also not alter the CFMetaData object directly, ever. Only DDL statements should be allowed to do that.
CASSANDRA-9712 will temporarily throw UOE for that call.
