Summary:
Unable to compute when histogram overflowed
Description:
It seems like with 2.1.0 histograms can't be computed most of the times:
$ nodetool cfhistograms draios top_files_by_agent1
nodetool: Unable to compute when histogram overflowed
See 'nodetool help' or 'nodetool help <command>'.
I can probably find a way to attach a .cql script to reproduce it, but I suspect it must be obvious to replicate it as it happens on more than 50% of my column families.
