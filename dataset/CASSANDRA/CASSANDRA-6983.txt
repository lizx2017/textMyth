Summary:
DirectoriesTest fails when run as root
Description:
When you run the DirectoriesTest as a normal user, it passes because it fails to create the 'bad' directory:
    [junit] ------------- Standard Error -----------------
    [junit] ERROR 16:16:18,111 Failed to create /tmp/cassandra4119802552776680052unittest/ks/bad directory
    [junit]  WARN 16:16:18,112 Blacklisting /tmp/cassandra4119802552776680052unittest/ks/bad for writes
    [junit] ------------- ---------------- ---------------
But when you run the test as root, it succeeds in making the directory, causing an assertion failure that it's unwritable:
    [junit] Testcase: testDiskFailurePolicy_best_effort(org.apache.cassandra.db.DirectoriesTest):       FAILED
    [junit] 
    [junit] junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: 
    [junit]     at org.apache.cassandra.db.DirectoriesTest.testDiskFailurePolicy_best_effort(DirectoriesTest.java:199)
It seems to me that we shouldn't be relying on failing the make the directory. If we're just going to test a nonexistent dir, why try to make one at all? And if that is supposed to succeed, then we have a problem with either the test or blacklisting.
