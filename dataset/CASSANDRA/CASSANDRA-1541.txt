Summary:
KEYS indexes recreated after first restart
Description:
I made sure I waited at least commitlog_sync_period_in_ms, but the SystemTable.isIndexBuilt flag doesn't appear to be sticking after a call to system_add_column_family (via CASSANDRA-1531). During the first restart after creation, the index is recreated, logging: "Creating index" and "Index _ complete" again. The second restart works as it should.
