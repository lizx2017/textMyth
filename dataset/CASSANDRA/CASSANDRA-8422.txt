Summary:
cassandra won't start up due to "Unable to gossip with any seeds" on the decommissioned node
Description:
2-node
nodeA - seed
nodeB
1. decommission nodeB from the cluster with nodetool
when it's finished, kill cassandra process on nodeB
2. delete data from commit/cache/data directories on nodeB
3. try to start cassandra on nodeB (first time)
=> FAILED with "Unable to gossip with any seeds"
4. try to start cassandra on nodeB (second time)
=> OK
It was not a one-time shot. I tried it a several times and encountered the same issue for some reason.
