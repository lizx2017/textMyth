Summary:
StorageService exposes two different objects for probability tracing
Description:
StorageServiceMBean exposes the tracing probability using two different methods:
    public void setTraceProbability(double probability);
    public double getTracingProbability();
In a JMX explorer like JConsole, two objects are presented: one called TraceProbability and the other called TracingProbability. One is read-only, the other write-only; this is a bit confusing.
It is possible to have a single object there by having the same suffix for both the getter and setter.
