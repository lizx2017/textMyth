Summary:
Decommission should take a token
Description:
Like removetoken, decom should take a token parameter. This is a bit easier said than done because it changes gossip, but I've seen enough people burned by this (as I have myself.) In the short term though decommission still accepts a token parameter which I thought we had fixed.
