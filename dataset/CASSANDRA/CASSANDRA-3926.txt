Summary:
all column validator options are not represented in cli help
Description:
The options added to column validators from CASSANDRA-2530 are not shown as options in the CLI help. I was going to create a column family with a float validator and double checked the help and it wasn't shown. So I just had to double check that I could. Would be nice to have those added to those docs, even though CQL is the way forward.
