Summary:
Cassandra-stress regression in 2.2
Description:
We are seeing some regression in performance when using cassandra-stress 2.2. You can see the difference at this url:
http://riptano.github.io/cassandra_performance/graph_v5/graph.html?stats=stress_regression.json&metric=op_rate&operation=1_write&smoothing=1&show_aggregates=true&xmin=0&xmax=108.57&ymin=0&ymax=168147.1
The cassandra version of the cluster doesn't seem to have any impact.
