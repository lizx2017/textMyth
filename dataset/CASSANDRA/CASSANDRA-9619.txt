Summary:
Read performance regression in tables with many columns on trunk and 2.2 vs. 2.1
Description:
There seems to be a regression in read in 2.2 and trunk, as compared to 2.1 and 2.0. I found it running cstar_perf jobs with 50-column tables. 2.2 may be worse than trunk, though my results on that aren't consistent. The relevant cstar_perf jobs are here:

http://cstar.datastax.com/tests/id/40ff2766-1248-11e5-bac8-42010af0688f
The sequence of commands for these jobs is
stress write n=65000000 -rate threads=300 -col n=FIXED\(50\)
stress read n=65000000 -rate threads=300
stress read n=65000000 -rate threads=300
Have a look at the operations per second going from the first read operation to the second read operation. They've fallen from ~135K to ~100K comparing trunk to 2.1 and 2.0. It's slightly worse for 2.2, and 2.2 operations per second fall continuously from the first to the second read operation.
There's a corresponding increase in read latency â€“ it's noticable on trunk and pretty bad on 2.2. Again, the latency gets higher and higher on 2.2 as the read operations progress (see the graphs here and here).
I see a similar regression in a more recent test, though in this one trunk performed worse than 2.2. This run also didn't display the increasing latency in 2.2.
This regression may show for smaller numbers of columns, but not as prominently, as shown in the results to this test with the stress default of 5 columns. There's an increase in latency variability on trunk and 2.2, but I don't see a regression in summary statistics.
My measurements aren't confounded by the recent regression in cassandra-stress; cstar_perf uses the same stress program (from trunk) on all versions on the cluster.
I'm currently working to
reproduce with a smaller workload so this is easier to bisect and debug.
get results with larger numbers of columns, since we've seen the regression on 50 columns but not the stress default of 5.
