Summary:
local consistency level during boostrap (may cause a write timeout on each write request)
Description:
Hi,
During bootstrap, for LOCAL_QUORUM and LOCAL_ONE consistencies, the DatacenterWriteResponseHandler were waiting for pending remote endpoints.
I think that's a regression, because it seems that it has been correctly implemented in CASSANDRA-833, but removed later.
It was specifically annoying in the case of RF=2 and cl=LOCAL_QUORUM, because during a bootstrap of a remote node, all requests ended in WriteTimeout, because they were waiting for a response that would never happen.
