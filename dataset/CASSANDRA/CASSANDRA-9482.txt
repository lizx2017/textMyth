Summary:
SSTable leak after stress and repair
Description:
I have a dtest that fails intermittently because of SSTable leaks. The test logic leading to the error is:
create a 5-node cluster
insert 5000 records with stress, RF=3 at CL=ONE
run flush on all nodes
run repair on a single node.
The leak is detected on a different node than repair was run on.
The failing test is here. The relevant error his here, along with the errors from the entire 5-node cluster. In these logs, the repair was run on node1 and the leak was found on node2.
I can bisect, but I thought I'd get the ball rolling in case someone knows where to look.
