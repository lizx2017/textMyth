Summary:
Token Generator needs to be partitioner aware
Description:
I do not agree with the decision to change the default partition from RP to murmur. Also whatever micro-benchmarking demonstrating performance gains is completely outweighed by disk latency anyway.
Assuming we are not going to change the default back there is another issue.
Historically, there are many blogs and reference material shows how to make tokens for RandomPartitioner. Indeed the relatively new TokenGenerator is 'unaware' of this change, as it is giving the user tokens for the Random Partitioner.

Token Generator Interactive Mode
--------------------------------

 How many datacenters will participate in this Cassandra cluster? 1
 How many nodes are in datacenter #1? 3

DC #1:
  Node #1:                                        0
  Node #2:   56713727820156410577229101238628035242
  Node #3:  113427455640312821154458202477256070484
This will lead to confusion amount new users and imbalanced rings. We should enhance the token-generator so it will require input from use on which partitioner they are using so it can do the appropriate math and give users the correct information.
