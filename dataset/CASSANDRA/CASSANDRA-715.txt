Summary:
HHOM goes into infinite loop, wasting cpu
Description:
To replicate: take a host down, cause hints to it, wait for HHOM to kick in
The issue is line 201 of HHOM:
startColumn = keyColumn.name(); // repeating the last as the first is fine since we just deleted it
That comment is false. The column may not have been deleted, since the endpoint could still be down. This causes HHOM to go into an infinite loop trying to deliver hints to a down host.
