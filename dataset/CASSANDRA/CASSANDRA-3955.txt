Summary:
HintedHandoff won't compact a single sstable, resulting in repeated log messages
Description:
First introduced by CASSANDRA-3554, and then mostly solved in CASSANDRA-3733, there is still one special case where the HH log message will repeat every 10 mins for 0 rows: when there have previously been hints delivered to the node, but now only a single sstable exists. Because the we refused to compact a single sstable, and it contains tombstones for the hints, the message repeats.
