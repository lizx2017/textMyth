Summary:
LatencyMetrics is reporting total latency in nanoseconds rather than microseconds
Description:
I don't know if this is the desired behaviour but all the comments in the code indicate that it should be reporting microseconds.
A single write shows the following:
WriteLatency
------------
Count: 1
Min: 315.853
Max: 379.022

WriteTotalLatency
-----------------
Count: 339667
In LatencyMetrics:
    /** Total latency in micro sec */
    public final Counter totalLatency;
