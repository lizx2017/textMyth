Summary:
cassandra-all 1.2.0 pom missing netty dependency
Description:
It seems that cassandra depends on netty now, however the pom excludes this dependency. This was previously reported as CASSANDRA-5181, but the fix for 5181 added netty to the dependency-management section of the pom, not the depencies section
