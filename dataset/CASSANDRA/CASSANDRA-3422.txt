Summary:
Can create a Column Family with comparator CounterColumnType which is subsequently unusable
Description:
It's probably the case that this shouldn't be allowed at all but one is currently allowed to create a Column Family with comparator CounterColumnType which then appears unusable.
CREATE COLUMNFAMILY comparator_cf_counter (id text PRIMARY KEY) WITH comparator=CounterColumnType
Fails
UPDATE comparator_cf_counter SET 1=1 + 1 WHERE id='test_key'
Error => invalid operation for non commutative columnfamily comparator_cf_counter
