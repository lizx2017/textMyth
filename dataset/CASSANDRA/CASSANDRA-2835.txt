Summary:
CFMetadata don't set the default for Replicate_on_write correctly
Description:
Replicate_on_write must default to true (defaulting to false is very dangerous and imho, the option of setting it to false shouldn't exist in the first place) and CFMetadata.DEFAULT_REPLICATE_ON_WRITE is correctly true. But it doesn't get set correctly. Instead, the code force the value of the cf_def even if it wasn't defined, resulting in setting it to false since that is the default value for a boolean in JAVA.
