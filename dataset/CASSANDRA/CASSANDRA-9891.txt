Summary:
AggregationTest.testAggregateWithWithWriteTimeOrTTL is fragile
Description:
I've seen AggregationTest.testAggregateWithWithWriteTimeOrTTL fail on cassci on the line
assertTrue(row.getInt("ttl(b)") > 4
Given that the ttl is set to 5 a few lines above and the CQL ttl() method returns the actual time-to-live (that is, it decrease with time), it feels safe to assume this test is overly fragile.
