Summary:
CL.ANY writes can still time out
Description:
If we know that all replicas are down at the beginning of a mutation, we will write a hint and return success.
But if we do not, we will attemp to write to replicas, time out, return failure, and then write a hint, violating our contract that (unless the coordinator goes down), writes at CL.ANY should always succeed.
