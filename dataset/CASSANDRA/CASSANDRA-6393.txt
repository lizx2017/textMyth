Summary:
Invalid metadata for IN ? queries
Description:
I tried to use the following CQL query:
DELETE FROM table WHERE id IN ?
using Java driver like this:
prepStatement.setList("id", idsAsList);
but got the following exception:
 java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: id is not a column defined in this metadata
    at com.datastax.driver.core.ColumnDefinitions.getAllIdx(ColumnDefinitions.java:273)
    at com.datastax.driver.core.BoundStatement.setList(BoundStatement.java:840)
Debugger shows that Cassandra sends "in(id)" in metadata. Is this correct?
