Summary:
Fix Findbugs: Condition misuse
Description:
We frequently misuse Condition objects, although there is no guarantee that all of the uses are abuses.
On the other hand, findbugs did find two issues that are likely to be bugs: not checking the return value of await(timeout), and calling wait() rather than await() on a Condition. See the attached.
In order to find unused method parameters for CASSANDRA-608, I ran FindBugs against Cassandra, and found a few interesting issues we ought to explore (but not the unused method params, oi.)
