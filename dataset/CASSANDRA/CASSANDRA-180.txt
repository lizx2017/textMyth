Summary:
Blocking insert may have fewer responses than replication factor
Description:
Currently, block_insert always assumes the number of responses equals the replication factor. However, for a small cluster (e,g, 1 node) and/or when failure occurs, the number of responses could be fewer than the replication factor.
