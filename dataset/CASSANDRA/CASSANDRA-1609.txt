Summary:
Cluster restart re-adds removed tokens
Description:
After a cluster restart one of our nodes began reporting tokens that had been removed a good while ago (week or more) in it's nodetool ring output. This probably has something to do with our change to persist the ring in CASSANDRA-1518 and removetoken changes in CASSANDRA-1216. The node didn't actually gossip the removed tokens so they showed up in TMD but not gossip.
Additionally all nodes began reporting a node that had been removed maybe an hour ago.
