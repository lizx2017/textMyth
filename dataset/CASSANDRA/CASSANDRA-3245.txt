Summary:
Don't fail when numactl is installed, but NUMA policies are not supported
Description:
When numactl is installed but NUMA policies are not supported, trying to run cassandra gives only:
numactl: This system does not support NUMA policy
..and the startup script fails there.
We should probably fail a little more gracefully. Possibly the best way to tell if numactl will work is by using:
numactl --hardware
but I don't have ready access to a machine with proper NUMA support at the moment so I can't check how easy it is to tell the difference in the output.
It looks just as reliable (if possibly a bit more brittle) to check for the existence of the directory /sys/devices/system/node. If that directory doesn't exist, we shouldn't even try to use or run numactl.
