Summary:
cqlsh --color option doesn't allow you to disable colors
Description:
There's no way to disable colors with cqlsh, despite it having a --color option, because that option can only enable color if present, not disable it, and the default is that color is enabled.
(Incidentally, if the --file option is used, it will disable color.)
