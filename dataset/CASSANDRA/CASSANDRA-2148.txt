Summary:
system CFs default to large memtable throughputs on large heaps
Description:
The default memtableThroughputInMB is calculated now based on the heap size. Most people running with a large heap in production explicitly set it for their memtable(s). However, the the CFs in the system keyspace still default to the calculated value which on a large heap can be quite large. HintsColumnFamily is really the only problematic one though as the others are flushed afters changes to them.
we should:
1) set the throughput on the hints CF to a reasonable max and min value - min(256, max(32, normalDefault/2))
2) set the throughput on the other system CFs to some small constant value (just as a safety); 8M sounds good
