Summary:
The native protocol server can trigger a Netty bug
Description:
The patch from CASSANDRA-5926 did fix the original deadlock, but unfortunately we can now run into a netty bug (with MemoryAwareThreadPoolExecutor): https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/1310.
That bug has been fixed in netty 3.6.6 but we're currently using an older version (3.5.9). So we should just upgrade our dependency to 3.6.6.
