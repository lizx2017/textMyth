Summary:
stress (2.1) spams console with java.util.NoSuchElementException when run against nodes recently created
Description:
I don't get any stack trace on the console, but I get two java.util.NoSuchElementException for each operation stress is doing.
This seems to occur when stress is being run against a recently created node (such as one from ccm).
To reproduce: create a ccm cluster, and run stress against it within a few minutes . Run a simple stress command like cassandra-stress write n=10 .
