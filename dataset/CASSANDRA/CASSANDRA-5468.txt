Summary:
Prepared statements from default keyspace are broken
Description:
Tested under CQL 3 binary protocol.
Preparing a statement from the default keyspace of the connection (statement scoped with keyspace) and then running it will always throw the error "no keyspace has been specified".
Exec: CREATE KEYSPACE Tests WITH replication = {'class': 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor' : 1}

Exec: CREATE TABLE Tests.AllTypes (a int, b int, primary key (a))

Prepare: insert into Tests.AllTypes (a, b) values (?, ?)
Exec prepared statement and exception "no keyspace has been specified" is thrown.
Doing a use Tests before preparing the statement solves the issue.
This used to work in 1.2.3.
