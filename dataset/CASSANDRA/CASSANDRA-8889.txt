Summary:
CQL spec is missing doc for support of bind variables for LIMIT, TTL, and TIMESTAMP
Description:
CASSANDRA-4450 added the ability to specify a bind variable for the integer value of a LIMIT, TTL, or TIMESTAMP option, but the CQL spec has not been updated to reflect this enhancement.
Also, the special predefined bind variable names are not documented in the CQL spec: "[limit]", "[ttl]", and "[timestamp]".
