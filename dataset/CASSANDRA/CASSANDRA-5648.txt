Summary:
Cassandra: Insert of null value not possible with CQL3?
Description:
Hi there,
I'm trying to migrate a project from thrift to cql3/java driver and I'm experiencing a strange problem.
Schema:
CREATE TABLE foo (
  key ascii,
  column1 ascii,
  foo ascii,
  PRIMARY KEY (key, column1)
) WITH COMPACT STORAGE;
The table just consists of a primary key and a value, sometimes all the information lies in the key though, so the value is not needed.
Through the thrift interface, it just works fine to leave out "foo".
Executing this query:
INSERT INTO foo(key, column1) VALUES ('test', 'test2');
Fails with
"Bad Request: Missing mandatory column foo"
though.
Explicitly inserting "null" as a value does not store the column / deletes the old one with a "null" value inserted through thrift.
Inserting an empty String works fine, but this seems a bit bloated.
Is this intended to (not) work this way?
Best,
Tobias
