Summary:
Counter AES performance issue
Description:
We noticed tonight when trying out AES for Counters in trunk, there is a serious performance issue when inlining the SSTables. We found that the way we are seeking in the file, BRAF keeps flushing out its buffer of 8MB, and we call dfile.sync() on every row. We are finalizing a patch to write a new SSTable on rebuild, instead of inlining.
