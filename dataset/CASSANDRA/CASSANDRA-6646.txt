Summary:
Disk Failure Policy ignores CorruptBlockException
Description:
If Cassandra is using compression and has a bad drive or stable, it will throw an CorruptBlockException.
Disk Failure Policy only works if it is an FSError and does not work for IOExceptions like this.
We need to better handle such exceptions as it causes nodes to not respond to the co-ordinator causing the client to timeout.
