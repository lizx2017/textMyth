Summary:
Deleting an element from a List which is null throws a NPE
Description:
I am seeing an NPE on the latest 2.1 branch with this sequence of deletes from a list - first delete the entire list, then attempt to delete one element.
I expected to see List index 0 out of bound, list has size 0 but instead got an NPE.

cqlsh:frozen_collections> DELETE s['1'] FROM t WHERE id = 'user';
It appears the DELETE emails... directly followed by DELETE emails[0]... is the offending sequence. Either one alone works fine, as does adding an intervening insert/update.
The same sequence performed on a Set rather than List works (as shown above).
