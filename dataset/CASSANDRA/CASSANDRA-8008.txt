Summary:
"Timed out waiting for timer thread" on large stress command
Description:
I've been using cstar_perf to test a performance scenario and was able to reproduce this error on a two node cluster with stock 2.1.0 while carrying out large stress writes (50M keys):
java.lang.RuntimeException: Timed out waiting for a timer thread - seems one got stuck
        at org.apache.cassandra.stress.util.Timing.snap(Timing.java:83)

        at org.apache.cassandra.stress.StressMetrics.access$300(StressMetrics.java:42)
        at org.apache.cassandra.stress.StressMetrics$2.run(StressMetrics.java:104)
        at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:745)
It looks like a similar error to that found in CASSANDRA-6943. I've also attached the test log and thread dumps.
