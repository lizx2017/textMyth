Summary:
Fix Findbugs: Static initializers
Description:
We have a few singleton classes that are not doing their lazy initialization correctly (we really need a generic solution to this problem, sigh). In most cases, we are missing 'volatile' on the static field. See attached.
In order to find unused method parameters for CASSANDRA-608, I ran FindBugs against Cassandra, and found a few interesting issues we ought to explore (but not the unused method params, oi.)
