Summary:
Unable to "point in time" restore if table/cf has been recreated
Description:
With Cassandra 2.1, and the addition of the CF UUID, the ability to do a "point in time" restore by restoring a snapshot and replaying commitlogs is lost if the table has been dropped and recreated.
When the table is recreated, the cf_id changes, and the commitlog replay mechanism skips the desired mutations as the cf_id no longer matches what's present in the schema.
There should exist a way to inform the replay that you want the mutations replayed even if the cf_id doesn't match.
