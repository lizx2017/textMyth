Summary:
bug when trying to describe a cf in a pre cql3 case sensitive keyspace
Description:
I can't describe column families in my schema defined via cassandra-cli. Update also seems to fail for the same CF's.
CREATE KEYSPACE Hastur
with placement_strategy = 'org.apache.cassandra.locator.SimpleStrategy'
and strategy_options =
{replication_factor:2}
;
CREATE COLUMN FAMILY LookupByKey
with compaction_strategy = 'LeveledCompactionStrategy'
and compression_options = null;
Then later, https://gist.github.com/3006886
