Summary:
Upgraded cassandra loses all cfs on restart
Description:
A bit dramatic summary, but hey;
If you upgrade cassandra and then restart it, you lose all your CFs, but they come back if you restart again.
This is due to fixSchemaNanoTimestamp not flushing the new data after truncating the CF and re-doing the mutations.
