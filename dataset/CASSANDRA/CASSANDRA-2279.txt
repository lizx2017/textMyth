The steps that I took to reproduce it were:
Create a keyspace, column family, and a key
Delete the key on Node 1 using the cli (del cf['key']
Flush
Repair on a cluster with more than 1 node
Wait GCSeconds
Compact
And the empty row would appear on Node 2
However, when I was able to get rid of the empty rows, I was following these steps on a single machine:
Create a keyspace, column family, and a key
Delete the key
Flush
Sample write (writing to some temporary key)
Deleting the attribute to that temporary key (not the entire key)
Flush
Compact
or these steps:
Create a keyspace, column family, and a key
Delete the key
Flush
Wait GCseconds
Compact
