Summary:
checkForEndpointCollision fails for legitimate collisions
Description:
Since CASSANDRA-7939, checkForEndpointCollision no longer catches a legitimate collision. Without CASSANDRA-7939, wiping a node and starting it again fails with 'A node with address %s already exists', but with it the node happily enters joining state, potentially streaming from the wrong place and violating consistency.
