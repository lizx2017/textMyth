Summary:
Handle zero index searchers in StorageProxy#estimateResultRowsPerRange()
Description:
CASSANDRA-7525 has broken Thrift's ability to filter based on arbitrary columns, even those without a secondary index defined.
Two of the thrift tests are broken because of this:
https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/cassandra-2.1.0/test/system/test_thrift_server.py#L1982
https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/cassandra-2.1.0/test/system/test_thrift_server.py#L1605
Both trigger this assert: https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/cassandra-2.1.0/src/java/org/apache/cassandra/service/StorageProxy.java#L1457
This is not a path reachable via CQL3 yet (until/if we further extend ALLOW FILTERING power), but it can be legally reached via Thrift, and should handle the possibility.
