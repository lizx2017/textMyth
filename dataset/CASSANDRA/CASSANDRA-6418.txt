Summary:
auto_snapshots are not removable via 'nodetool clearsnapshot'
Description:
Snapshots of deleted CFs created via the "auto_snapshot" configuration parameter appear to not be tracked. The result is that 'nodetool clearsnapshot <keyspace with deleted CFs>' does nothing, and short of manually removing the files from the filesystem, deleted CFs remain indefinitely taking up space.
I'm not sure if this is intended, but it seems pretty counter-intuitive. I haven't found any documentation that indicates "auto_snapshots" would be ignored by 'nodetool clearsnapshot'.
