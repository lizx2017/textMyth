Summary:
Not all column families are created
Description:
It seems that not all column families will be created via system_add_keyspace in some cases. To reproduce:
Run stress.py (with CASSANDRA-1033) inserts (I used 1M) against standard columns. During this run, both Standard1 and Super1 will be created.
Run stress.py again, this time against super columns. Due to CASSANDRA-1036 no errors will be visible to the client but can be observed in the log.
You can switch the order and stress supers first, in which case Standard1 will not exist. If you call describe_keyspace on Keyspace1, it will show both CFs even though only one will work.
