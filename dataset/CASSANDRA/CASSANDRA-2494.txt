Summary:
Quorum reads are not monotonically consistent
Description:
As discussed in this thread,
http://www.mail-archive.com/user@cassandra.apache.org/msg12421.html
Quorum reads should be consistent. Assume we have a cluster of 3 nodes (X,Y,Z) and a replication factor of 3. If a write of N is committed to X, but not Y and Z, then a read from X should not return N unless the read is committed to at least two nodes. To ensure this, a read from X should wait for an ack of the read repair write from either Y or Z before returning.
Are there system tests for cassandra? If so, there should be a test similar to the original post in the email thread. One thread should write 1,2,3... at consistency level ONE. Another thread should read at consistency level QUORUM from a random host, and verify that each read is >= the last read.
