Summary:
Outdated comment in default storage-conf.xml
Description:
There is a comment for the "Keyspace" element
~ The default ColumnSort is Time for standard column families. For
~ super column families, specifying ColumnSort is not supported; the
~ supercolumns themselves are always name-sorted and their subcolumns
~ are always time-sorted.
This seems to be outdated as far as I can tell and could be deleted as the default "CompareWith" value (BytesType) is explained later for the ColumnFamily element which seems to be more appropiate. The limitation seems to have been lifted (again: as far as I can tell, I'm new to Cassandra).
