Summary:
get_slice_from forces iterating all columns and leaks file handlers with exception
Description:
There are 2 bugs in the get_slice_from code in CFS.java.
1. The following 2 lines forces all columns to be iterated in each iterator, which is inefficient.
List<IColumn> L = new ArrayList();
CollectionUtils.addAll(L, collated);
2. If any exception occurs, the opened file handlers are not closed.
