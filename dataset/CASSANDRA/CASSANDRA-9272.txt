Summary:
Atomic Batch Statements Fail to Execute on Some Coordinators
Description:
Install and configure a three-node Cassandra cluster spread across two data centers (DCs). Place two Cassandra instances in DC1 and one Cassandra instance in DC2. (We have designated one node as a seed in each data center.)
Gracefully shut down any one Cassandra instance in DC1. This can be done by running 'kill <process_id>' in Linux.
Open a CQL Shell connection to the remaining node in DC1.
Create the following keyspace: CREATE KEYSPACE batch_test WITH replication = {'class': 'NetworkTopologyStrategy', 'DC1': '2', 'DC2':'1'};
Create the following table: CREATE TABLE batch_test.batch_table ( partition_key TEXT PRIMARY KEY );
Execute the following atomic batch query: BEGIN BATCH INSERT INTO batch_test.batch_table (partition_key) VALUES ('a'); INSERT INTO batch_test.batch_table (partition_key) VALUES ('b'); APPLY BATCH;
Observe an availability-related error, despite a sufficient number of nodes available to service the query. The trace below shows sample results from our cluster:
DC1
cqlsh> CONSISTENCY
Current consistency level is ONE.
cqlsh> BEGIN BATCH INSERT INTO batch_test.batch_table (partition_key) VALUES ('a'); INSERT INTO batch_test.batch_table (partition_key) VALUES ('b'); APPLY BATCH;
Unable to complete request: one or more nodes were unavailable.
cqlsh> CONSISTENCY QUORUM
Consistency level set to QUORUM.
cqlsh> BEGIN BATCH INSERT INTO batch_test.batch_table (partition_key) VALUES ('a'); INSERT INTO batch_test.batch_table (partition_key) VALUES ('b'); APPLY BATCH;
Unable to complete request: one or more nodes were unavailable.
cqlsh> BEGIN UNLOGGED BATCH INSERT INTO batch_test.batch_table (partition_key) VALUES ('a'); INSERT INTO batch_test.batch_table (partition_key) VALUES ('b'); APPLY BATCH;
cqlsh>
Note: an UNLOGGED BATCH executes successfully. A regular BATCH also executes successfully if it only contains one INSERT query.
We now show a similar trace using a CQL Shell connected to the Cassandra instance in DC2:
DC2
â€”
cqlsh> CONSISTENCY
Current consistency level is ONE.
cqlsh> BEGIN BATCH INSERT INTO batch_test.batch_table (partition_key) VALUES ('a'); INSERT INTO batch_test.batch_table (partition_key) VALUES ('b'); APPLY BATCH;
cqlsh> CONSISTENCY QUORUM
Consistency level set to QUORUM.
cqlsh> BEGIN BATCH INSERT INTO batch_test.batch_table (partition_key) VALUES ('a'); INSERT INTO batch_test.batch_table (partition_key) VALUES ('b'); APPLY BATCH;
cqlsh> BEGIN UNLOGGED BATCH INSERT INTO batch_test.batch_table (partition_key) VALUES ('a'); INSERT INTO batch_test.batch_table (partition_key) VALUES ('b'); APPLY BATCH;
cqlsh>
All queries execute successfully using the DC2 Cassandra instance as a coordinator.
