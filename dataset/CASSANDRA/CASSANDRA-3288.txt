Summary:
CfDef can default to an invalid id and fail during system_add_column_family
Description:
The line from this commit:
https://github.com/apache/cassandra/commit/38e3e85b121ba6308ba3ceb26312d12ed0d609ec#L1R683
Introduced an issue in that some clients, particularly Hector, will send a CfDef with an ID having been set to 0. Done via the CfDef#setId, the isSetId bit is flipped to true, causing error if schemaId of 0 already exists, which given the use case, is likely.
Since we know the context of a system_create_column_family, this can be sidestepped by just stepping on whatever ID is there (irrelevant on a create anyway) with the value returned from: Schema.instance.nextCFId()
