Summary:
Adjustments to range query and 2ary index query parallelism are incorrect
Description:
There was a simple error in the code from CASSANDRA-1337 where the parallelism is adjusted if the first round of fetches do not satisfy the limit. This generally results in the second fetch being much larger than it needs to be.
