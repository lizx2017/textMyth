Summary:
CLI can show bad DESCRIBE for CQL3 CF if given the CF explicitly
Description:
The CLI omits CQL3 tables if you do a regular describe command. It also emits a nice warning about it. However, if you do a describe with an explicit CF name, it does something a bit unintuitive:
[default@ryan] describe r1;

WARNING: CQL3 tables are intentionally omitted from 'describe' output.
See https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-4377 for details.

    ColumnFamily: r1
      Key Validation Class: org.apache.cassandra.db.marshal.Int32Type
      Default column value validator: org.apache.cassandra.db.marshal.BytesType
      Cells sorted by: org.apache.cassandra.db.marshal.CompositeType(org.apache.cassandra.db.marshal.UTF8Type)
      GC grace seconds: 0
      Compaction min/max thresholds: 0/0
      Read repair chance: 0.0
      DC Local Read repair chance: 0.0
      Populate IO Cache on flush: false

      Bloom Filter FP chance: default
      Built indexes: []
      Compaction Strategy: null
In this case it emitted the WARNING message, but it still showed the table anyway, and many of the CF settings are incorrect because of this. Better to show nothing than incorrect values.
