Summary:
Compaction not starting for new tables
Description:
Something committed since 2.1.8 broke cassandra-2.1 HEAD
create keyspace test with replication = {'class': 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor': 1};
create table test.stcs ( a int PRIMARY KEY , b int);
repeat more than 4 times:
insert into test.stcs (a, b) VALUES ( 1, 1);
nodetool flush test stcs

ls <data dir>/test/stcs-*
See a bunch of sstables where STCS should have kicked in and compacted them down some.
