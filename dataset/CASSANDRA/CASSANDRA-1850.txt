Summary:
When the ANTLR code generation fails the build continues and ignores the failure
Description:
When trying to tweak the build, I broke the ANTLR code generation tasks, but as I was not doing a full clean build the generated code was still present, so I missed the fact that the code generation was broken. It would be nice if the antlr tasks had failonerror="true"
