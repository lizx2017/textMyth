Summary:
cassandra-stress does not honour consistency level (cl) parameter when used in combination with user command
Description:
The stress test tool does not honour "cl" parameter when used in combination with the "user" command. Consistency level will be default ONE no matter what is set by "cl=".
Works fine with "write" command.
How to reproduce:
1. Create a suitable yaml-file to use in test
2. Run e.g.
./cassandra-stress user profile=./file.yaml cl=ALL no-warmup duration=10s  ops\(insert=1\) -rate threads=4 -port jmx=7100
3. Observe that cl=ONE in trace logs
