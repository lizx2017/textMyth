Summary:
Query on a secondary index stopped working
Description:
After upgrading from cassandra 2.0.10 to 2.1.2 this type of query (using cqlsh) on a secondary index have stopped working (not returning results):
select * from tweets_updated where updated = '2014-09-06' limit 1;
However the data exists:
select * from tweets_updated limit 5;

 uname           | updated                  | updated_date
-----------------+--------------------------+--------------
      xxxxxx1 | 2014-08-22 17:37:46-0700 |         null
   xxxxxx2 |                     null |   2014-09-06
There are two secondary indexes:
CREATE TABLE tweets.tweets_updated (
    uname text PRIMARY KEY,
    updated timestamp,
    updated_date text
) WITH bloom_filter_fp_chance = 0.01
    AND caching = '{"keys":"ALL", "rows_per_partition":"NONE"}'
    AND comment = ''
    AND compaction = {'min_threshold': '4', 'class': 'org.apache.cassandra.db.compaction.SizeTieredCompactionStrategy', 'max_threshold': '32'}
    AND compression = {'sstable_compression': 'org.apache.cassandra.io.compress.LZ4Compressor'}
    AND dclocal_read_repair_chance = 0.0
    AND default_time_to_live = 0
    AND gc_grace_seconds = 864000
    AND max_index_interval = 2048
    AND memtable_flush_period_in_ms = 0
    AND min_index_interval = 128
    AND read_repair_chance = 0.1
    AND speculative_retry = '99.0PERCENTILE';
CREATE INDEX tweets_updated_updated_idx ON tweets.tweets_updated (updated);
CREATE INDEX updated_date ON tweets.tweets_updated (updated_date);
I've run nodetool rebuild_index on both of them after upgrade - did not help.
