Summary:
Offline scrub does not migrate the directory structure on migration from 1.0.x to 1.1.x and causes the keyspace to disappear
Description:
Due to CASSANDRA-4411, upon migration from 1.0.x to 1.1.x containing LCS-compacted sstables, an offline scrub should be run before Cassandra 1.1.x is started. But Cassandra 1.1.x uses a new directory structure (CASSANDRA-2749) that offline scrubber doesn't detect or try to migrate.
How to reproduce:
1- Run cassandra 1.0.12.
2- Run stress tool, let Cassandra flush Keyspace1 or flush manually.
3- Stop cassandra 1.0.12
4- Run ./bin/sstablescrub Keyspace1 Standard1
which returns "Unknown keyspace/columnFamily Keyspace1.Standard1" and notice the data directory isn't migrated.
5- Run cassandra 1.1.9. Keyspace1 doesn't get loaded and Cassandra doesn't try to migrate the directory structure. Also commitlog entries get skipped: "Skipped XXXXX mutations from unknown (probably removed) CF with id 1000"
Without the unsuccessful step 4, Cassandra 1.1.9 loads and migrates the Keyspace correctly.
