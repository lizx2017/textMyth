Summary:
After a minor compaction, deleted key-slices are visible again
Description:
After a minor compaction, deleted key-slices are visible again.
Steps to reproduce:
1) Insert a row named "test".
2) Insert 500000 rows. During this step, row "test" is included in a major compaction:
file-1, file-2, file-3 and file-4 compacted to file-5 (includes "test").
3) Delete row named "test".
4) Insert 500000 rows. During this step, row "test" is included in a minor compaction:
file-6, file-7, file-8 and file-9 compacted to file-10 (should include tombstoned "test").
After step 4, row "test" is live again.
Test environment:
Single node with empty database.
Standard configured super-column-family (I see this behavior with several gc_grace settings (big and small values):
create column family Customers with column_type = 'Super' and comparator = 'BytesType;
In Cassandra 0.7.6 I observe the expected behavior, i.e. after step 4, the row is still deleted.
I've included a .NET program to reproduce the problem. I will add a Java version later on.
