Summary:
StreamingService.StreamDestinations never empties
Description:
The problem is that StreamOutManager.streamManagers never has anything removed from it. In order for StreamingService.getDestinations() to work properly, we either need to track hosts differently, or remove from StreamOutManager.streamManagers when we are no longer streaming to a node.
I lean towards the former, as any time we call StreamOutManager.get(), we're back in the same boat.
