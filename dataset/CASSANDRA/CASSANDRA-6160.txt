Summary:
Throw errror when attempting to create a secondary index against counter
Description:
Using CQL you can create a secondary index against a counter which is then non-functional.
cqlsh:test> create table test2 (col1 int, col2 counter, primary key (col1)) ;
cqlsh:test> create index dodgy on test2(col2) ;
cqlsh:test> update test2 set col2 = col2 + 0 where col1 = 1 ;
cqlsh:test> select * from test2 ;

 col1 | col2
------+------
    1 |    0

cqlsh:t7088> select * from test2 where col2 = 0 ;
We should return an error to let users know they are in unsupported territory.
