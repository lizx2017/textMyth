Summary:
Cannot create secondary index on a table WITH COMPACT STORAGE
Description:
In CASSANDRA-8156 it is said that secondary indexes are not allowed on clustering columns in COMPACT tables.
However, I found that it is not possible to create a secondary index on the value column in a COMPACT table:
CREATE TABLE t (
a INT,
b INT,
c INT,
PRIMARY KEY (a, b)
) WITH COMPACT STORAGE;
CREATE INDEX ON t (c);
Bad Request: Secondary indexes are not supported on PRIMARY KEY columns in COMPACT STORAGE tables
