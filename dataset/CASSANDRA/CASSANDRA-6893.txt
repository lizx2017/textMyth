Summary:
Unintended update with conditional statement
Description:
After updated to 2.0.6, I have encountered the strange behavior of conditional updates.
When I executed CQL like UPDATE test SET value = ? WHERE id = ? IF value = ? in concurrent, sometimes cassandra returns true even if value is not satisfied the condition.
I have attached the program which reproduce this issue. The program works fine in cassandra 2.0.5. But it seems that resets values while execution in 2.0.6.
