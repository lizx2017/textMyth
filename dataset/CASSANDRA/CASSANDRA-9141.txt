Summary:
Scrub errors when attempting to abort
Description:
On trunk, when scrub attempts to abort, the following error occurs:
java.lang.IllegalStateException: Cannot abort - changes have already been committed
    at org.apache.cassandra.io.sstable.SSTableRewriter.abort(SSTableRewriter.java:195)
    at org.apache.cassandra.db.compaction.Scrubber.scrub(Scrubber.java:277)
    at org.apache.cassandra.db.ScrubTest.testScrubCorruptedCounterRow(ScrubTest.java:158)
This is reproduceable with the ScrubTest.testScrubCorruptedCounterRow() unit test, although the patch to correctly enable compression from CASSANDRA-9135 is required (if it's not committed yet).
Assigning to Yuki Morishita for now, since I don't have a better idea of who to assign to.
