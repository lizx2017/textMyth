Summary:
LOCAL_QUORUM writes returns wrong message
Description:
We have two DC3, each with 7 nodes.
Here is the keyspace setup:
create keyspace test
with placement_strategy = 'NetworkTopologyStrategy'
and strategy_options =
{DC2 : 3, DC1 : 3}
and durable_writes = true;
We brought down two nodes in DC2 for maintenance. We only write to DC1 using local_quroum (using datastax JavaClient)
But we see this errors in the log:
Cassandra timeout during write query at consistency LOCAL_QUORUM (4 replica were required but only 3 acknowledged the write
why does it say 4 replica were required? and Why would it give error back to client since local_quorum should succeed.
Here are the output from nodetool status
Note: Ownership information does not include topology; for complete information, specify a keyspace

I did a cql trace on the query and here is the trace, and it does say
Write timeout; received 3 of 4 required replies | 17:27:52,831 | 10.1.0.1 | 2002873
at the end. I guess that is where the client gets the error from. But the rows was inserted to Cassandra correctly. And I traced read with local_quorum and it behaves correctly and the reads don't go to DC2. The problem is only with writes on local_quorum.
