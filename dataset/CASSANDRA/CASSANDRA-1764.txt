Summary:
NPE on system_update_cf when adding an index to a column without existing metadata
Description:
When trying to create a secondary index using system_update_column_family(), if you try to add an index on a column that does not already have an existing entry in the CfDef's column_metadata, a NullPointerException is thrown.
Looks like the logic in o.a.c.config.CFMetaData.apply() is faulty. Specifically, creating a toUpdate Set (similar to the toAdd and toDelete) sets and using that for the loop ~ line 663 would fix this.
