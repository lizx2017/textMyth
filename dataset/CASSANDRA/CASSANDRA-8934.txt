Summary:
COPY command has inherent 128KB field size limit
Description:
In using the COPY command as follows:
cqlsh -e "COPY test.test1mb(pkey, ccol, data) FROM 'in/data1MB/data1MB_9.csv'"
the following error is thrown:
<stdin>:1:field larger than field limit (131072)
The data file contains a field that is greater than 128KB (it's more like almost 1MB).
A work-around (thanks to Jeremiah Jordan and Tyler Hobbs is to modify the cqlsh script and add the line
csv.field_size_limit(1000000000)
anywhere after the line
import csv
