Summary:
getNextBackgroundTask gives up too easily
Description:
getNextBackgroundTask only attempts once to markSSTablesForCompaction. So if many task invocations are scanning compaction candidates concurrently (e.g. because submitBackground fires off a bunch of gNBT at once), it's highly likely that all will compute the same victim list and only one will return a CompactionTask, resulting in less compaction concurrency than desired.
