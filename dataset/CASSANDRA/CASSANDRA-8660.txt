Summary:
Cassandra makes Java 1.7+ SEGFAULT
Description:
We upgraded a 3 nodes cluster from Cassandra 2.0.11-5f54285e9e to 2.1-7e6d9eb842.
With Cassandra 2.1 , within ~10 min. cassandra manages to makes Java 1.7.0_72-b14 segfault. This is also tested and same behavior w/ Java 1.7.0_60-b19 and 1.8.0_25-b17.
We were able to use same data, downgrade back to 2.0 and things ran for ~3-4 days w/ no hick up. Upgrading back to Cassandra-2.1, Java does a segfault again.
See attached hs_err file.
