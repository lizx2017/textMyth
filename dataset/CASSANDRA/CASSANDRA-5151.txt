Summary:
Implement better way of eliminating compaction left overs.
Description:
This is from discussion in CASSANDRA-5137. Currently we skip loading SSTables that are left over from incomplete compaction to not over-count counter, but the way we track compaction completion is not secure.
One possible solution is to create system CF like:
create table compaction_log (
  id uuid primary key,
  inputs set<int>,
  outputs set<int>
);
to track incomplete compaction.
