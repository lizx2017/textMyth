Summary:
get_range_slice returns multiple copies of each row for ConsistencyLevel > ONE
Description:
I've noticed that both 0.5.1 and 0.6b2 return multiple identical copies of the data stored in my keyspace whenever I make a call to get_range_slice or get_range_slices using
ConsistencyLevel.QUORUM and ReplicationFactor is greater than one.
So with ReplicationFactor set to 2 for my application's KeySpace I get double the number of KeySlices that I expect to get. When using ConsistencyLevel.ONE I get only one KeySlice for each row.
I've seen this happen with Cassandra 0.5.1 and with 0.6 beta 2. The behavior on 0.6 beta 2 is exhibited with both get_range_slice and get_range_slices.
The attached Java program demonstrates the issue for 0.6 beta 2. The program writes a series of single-column rows into the Standard1 table, and then uses get_range_slice to receive a list of all row. The returned number of rows is consistently twice the number of rows written to the database. I wipe out the database completely before running the test.
