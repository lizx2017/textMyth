Summary:
MarshalException is thrown when cassandra-cli creates the example Keyspace specified by conf/schema-sample.txt
Description:
Use the following steps to recreate the bug:
1. Checkout the source code from trunk. For my case, revision is 1085753.
2. Run "ant" to build cassandra.
3. Run "bin/cassandra -f" to start cassandra.
4. Run "bin/cassandra-cli -host localhost --file conf/schema-sample.txt".
Then there is the following message:
... schemas agree across the cluster
Line 9 => org.apache.cassandra.db.marshal.MarshalException: cannot parse 'birthdate' as hex bytes
The root cause is BytesType's fromString method. FBUtilities's hexToBytes method is invoked with "birthdate". NumberFormatException is thrown since "birthdate" is not a hex string.
BytesType.java
    public ByteBuffer fromString(String source)
    {
        try
        {
            return ByteBuffer.wrap(FBUtilities.hexToBytes(source));
        }
        catch (NumberFormatException e)
        {
            throw new MarshalException(String.format("cannot parse '%s' as hex bytes", source), e);
        }
    }
