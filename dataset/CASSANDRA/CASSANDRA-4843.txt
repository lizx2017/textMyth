Summary:
When upgrading from 1.1.6 to 1.20 change in partitioner causes nodes not to start
Description:
ERROR 10:17:20,341 Cannot open /home/edward/cassandra/data/system/schema_keyspaces/system-schema_keyspaces-hf-1 because partitioner does not match org.apache.cassandra.dht.RandomPartitioner != org.apache.cassandra.dht.Murmur3Partitioner
This is because 1.2 has a new default partitioner, why are we changing the default? Is this wise? The current partitioner has been rock solid for years.
Should the previously known partition be stored in the schema like the previously know seed nodes, and schema?
