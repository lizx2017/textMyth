Summary:
CollectionType validate method should have a proper implementation
Description:
This is pretty much the same problem than for CASSANDRA-6783 but with the validate method. Namely, we use to never need that method for ListType/SetType/MapType but we need it now with UDT. More precisely, passing a UDT value with collections inside in a prepare statement currently throws an UnsupportedOperationException.
