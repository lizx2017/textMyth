Summary:
Pig CqlStorage read schema changes to (value, value ... value) from ((name,value), (name, value) ... (name, value)) . Do we need make it backward compatible?
Description:
Since the pushdown needs the schema change from (name, value) tuple to value
  schema: (value, value, value) where keys are in the front. Each has its name in the column schema
Doesn't anyone needs backward compatible which will block filter push down?
The new schema is much concise than the old one, and It still keeps the column name in the column schema.
