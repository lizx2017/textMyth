Summary:
HHOM and BM direct delivery should not cause hints to be written on timeout
Description:
Currently, a timed out HHOM hint delivery would create a further hint, with a wrong TTL. BM direct delivery code is using the same code snippet basically, so is also affected (with slightly worse consequences).
