Summary:
Removing cold_reads_to_omit is not backwards compatible
Description:
While doing some tests on cassandra-2.1.5-tentative I found the cold_reads_to_omit parameter in SizeTieredCompactionStrategy was removed, this breaks our CREATE TABLE statements. This was done in CASSANDRA-8860 and if I understand Marcus comment in that JIRA, the intention was to keep the parameter in 2.1 but ignore it to avoid breaking existing code. But the patch actually removes the parameter.
