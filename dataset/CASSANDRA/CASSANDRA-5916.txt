Summary:
gossip and tokenMetadata get hostId out of sync on failed replace_node with the same IP address
Description:
If you try to replace_node an existing, live hostId, it will error out. However if you're using an existing IP to do this (as in, you chose the wrong uuid to replace on accident) then the newly generated hostId wipes out the old one in TMD, and when you do try to replace it replace_node will complain it does not exist. Examination of gossipinfo still shows the old hostId, however now you can't replace it either.
