Summary:
SSTables limited to (2^31)/15 keys
Description:
The current BloomFilter implementation requires a BitSet of (bucket_count * num_keys) in size, and that calculation is currently performed in an integer, which causes overflow for around 140 million keys in one SSTable.
Short term fix: perform the calculation in a long, and cap the value to the maximum size of a BitSet.
Long term fix: begin partitioning BitSets, perhaps using Linear Bloom Filters.
