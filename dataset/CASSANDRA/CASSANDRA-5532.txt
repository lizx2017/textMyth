Summary:
Maven package installation broken by recent build changes
Description:
CASSANDRA-3818 provides the ability to disable maven ant tests during the build. Part of the change is to refactor the maven-ant-tasks-retrieve-build target to wrapped by an antcall, with a guard condition to check if m-a-t should be used. The use of antcall causes the target & those targets it depends on to be called in a separate scope to the main build, which unfortunately means that the repository refs and ant macros which get defined there are not available once the antcall is completed. The final effect is that the mvn-install task fails as the install macro is not defined in its scope, and the artifacts task fails due to the repository refs being similarly undefined. I haven't tried it, but I suspect the publish task would be affected in the same way.
