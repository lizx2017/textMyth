Summary:
Remove multithreaded compaction (and precompactedrow)
Description:
There is at best a very small sweet spot for multithreaded compaction (ParallelCompactionIterable). For large rows, we stall the pipeline and fall back to a single LCR pass. For small rows, the overhead of the coordination outweighs the benefits of parallelization (45s to compact 2x1M stress rows with multithreading enabled, vs 35 with it disabled).
