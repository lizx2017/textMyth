Summary:
While using BulkOutputFormat unneccessarily look for the cassandra.yaml file.
Description:
I am trying to use BulkOutputFormat to stream the data from map of Hadoop job. I have set the cassandra related configuration using ConfigHelper ,Also have looked into Cassandra code seems Cassandra has taken care that it should not look for the cassandra.yaml file.
But still when I run the job i get the following error:
{
12/01/13 11:30:04 WARN mapred.JobClient: Use GenericOptionsParser for parsing the arguments. Applications should implement Tool for the same.
12/01/13 11:30:04 INFO input.FileInputFormat: Total input paths to process : 1

}
Also let me know how can i make this cassandra.yaml file available to Hadoop mapreduce job?
