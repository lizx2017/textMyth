Summary:
row deletions do not add to memtable op count
Description:
from discussion http://www.mail-archive.com/user@cassandra.apache.org/msg12531.html
Memtable.resolve() uses the count of columns in the CF to bump the op count however RowMutation.delete() does not add any columns to the CF when an entire row is deleted. If a super column or column is deleted it adds 1 towards the op count. Deleting many named columns will add many to the op count.
