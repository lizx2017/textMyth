Summary:
Token, DecoratedKey, RowPosition and all bound types should not make any hidden references to the database partitioner
Description:
Currently some of the functionality of Token refers to StorageService.getPartitioner() to avoid needing an extra argument. This is in turn implicitly used by RowPosition and then Range, causing possible problems, for example when ranges on secondary indices are used in a murmur-partitioned database.
These references should be removed to force explicit choice of partitioner by callers; alternatively, the Token interface could be changed to provide a reference to the partitioner that created it.
(Note: the hidden reference to partitioner in serialization is a separate issue.)
