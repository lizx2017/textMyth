Summary:
Remove cold_reads_to_omit from STCS
Description:
While I upgrading my cluster to 2.1.3, I find some nodes (not all) may have GC issue after the node restarting successfully. Old gen grows very fast and most of the space can not be recycled after setting its status to normal immediately. The qps of both reading and writing are very low and there is no heavy compaction.
Jmap result seems strange that there are too many java.util.HashMap$Entry objects in heap, where in my experience the "[B" is usually the No1.
If I downgrade it to 2.1.1, this issue will not appear.
I uploaded conf files and jstack/jmap outputs. I'll upload heap dump if someone need it.
