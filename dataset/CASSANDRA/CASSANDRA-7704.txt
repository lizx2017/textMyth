FileNotFoundException during STREAM-OUT triggers 100% CPU usage
Description:
See attached backtrace which was what triggered this. This stream failed and then ~12 seconds later it emitted that exception. At that point, all CPUs went to 100%. A thread dump shows all the ReadStage threads stuck inside IntervalTree.searchInternal inside of CFS.markReferenced().
