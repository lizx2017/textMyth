Summary:
ColumnFamilyRecordReader hadoop integration fails with ghost keys
Description:
When running hadoop-cassandra jobs with range queries over ghost keys, the ColumnFamilyRecordReader throws an exception if the last key in a slice_range query is a ghost key.
This seems to be related to changes made in CASSANDRA-2855 to prevent ghost keys appearing in a hadoop map.
The call stack trace is attached.
I made a one-line change to ColumnFamilyRecordReader.java, which seems to solve this issue for us.
