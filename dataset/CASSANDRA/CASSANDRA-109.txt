Summary:
Missing null check for READ-REPAIR header
Description:
The READ-REPAIR header is assumed to always be present which is no longer the case. This leads to a non-critical NullPointerException in ReadVerbHandler:109
String repair = new String( message.getHeader(ReadCommand.DO_REPAIR) );
A null check is needed.
