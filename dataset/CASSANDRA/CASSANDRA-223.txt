Summary:
time-based slicing does not work correctly w/ "historical" memtables
Description:
TimeFilter assumes that it is done as soon as it finds a column stamped earlier than what it is filtering on, but when you have a group of "historical" memtables whose columns were written in an arbitrary order this is not a safe assumption.
It is not even a safe assumption when dealing with a single memtable + sstable pair, as the attached new test shows.
