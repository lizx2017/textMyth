Summary:
BulkOutputFormat shouldn't need flags to specify the output type
Description:
BOF currently requires the IS_SUPER boolean to be set to determine if the output CF is going to be a super or not, and would similarly use a flag to indicate counters (if there was support for that yet.) Instead, it should be able to introspect the mutations to determine what kind of columns to write.
