Summary:
cqlsh: handle when full cassandra type class names are given
Description:
When a builtin Cassandra type was being used for data in previous versions of Cassandra, only the short name was sent: "UTF8Type", "TimeUUIDType", etc. Starting with 1.2, as of CASSANDRA-4453, the full class names are sent.
Cqlsh doesn't know how to handle this, and is currently treating all data as if it were an unknown type. This goes as far as to cause an exception when the type is actually a number, because the driver deserializes it right, and then cqlsh tries to use it as a string.
Here for googlage:
AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'replace'
Fixeries are in order.
