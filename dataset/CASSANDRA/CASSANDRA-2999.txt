Summary:
cassandra-cli doesn't accept floats for memtable_thoughput
Description:
The cassandra-cli does not accept floats for the value of memtable_throughput (memtable_throughput_in_mb). This means that you can't specify a value with sub-MB resolution, such as 0.5.
This probably doesn't matter much for production, but it's useful for testing really low memtable thresholds.
