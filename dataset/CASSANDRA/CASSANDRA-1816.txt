Summary:
cassandra deb should depend on adduser
Description:
The cassandra debian package uses the addgroup and adduser commands in its postinst script, which are found in the 'adduser' package, but the cassandra debian package does not depend on adduser. When a user does not already have adduser installed, this will lead to an error like:
Setting up cassandra (0.7.0~rc1) ...
/var/lib/dpkg/info/cassandra.postinst: 50: addgroup: not found
dpkg: error processing cassandra (--configure):
 subprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 127
Yes, this won't happen much, because systems without adduser installed are rare. But adduser is not "Essential: yes", so it will happen sometimes in bare-bones VMs or development environments.
