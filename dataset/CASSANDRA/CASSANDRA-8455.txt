Summary:
IndexOutOfBoundsException when building SyntaxError message snippet
Description:
It looks like some syntax errors can result in an IndexOutOfBoundsException when the error message snippet is being built:
cqlsh> create table foo (a int primary key, b int;
<ErrorMessage code=2000 [Syntax error in CQL query] message="Failed parsing statement: [create table foo (a int primary key, b int;] reason: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException -1">
There isn't any error or stacktrace in the server logs. It would be good to fix that as well.
