Summary:
Error when creating multiple CQLSSTableWriters for more than one column family in the same keyspace
Description:
The reason why this occurs is if the keyspace has already been loaded (due to another column family being previously loaded in the same keyspace), CQLSSTableWriter builder only loads the column family via Schema.load(CFMetaData). However, Schema.load(CFMetaData) only adds to the Schema.cfIdMap without making the proper addition to the CFMetaData map belonging to the KSMetaData map.
