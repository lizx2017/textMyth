Summary:
ColumnFamilyMetrics#totalDiskSpaceUsed gets wrong value when SSTable is deleted
Description:
ColumnFamilyMetrics#totalDiskSpaceUsed is decremented when actual SSTables files are deleted from disk. The amount of decrement is calculated at the beginning of SSTableReader instantiation(through SSTableDeletionTask).
But the size can change because Summary.db file may be re-created after SSTableReader instantiation, and that leads to calculate wrong value for totalDiskSpaceUsed.
I attached unit test file for 2.0, but you can also compare the value after doing "TRUNCATE".
