Summary:
Java Build Path is broken in Eclipse after running generate-eclipse-files Ant target
Description:
Following the instructions in http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/RunningCassandraInEclipse, but checking out v0.8.1:
After running the 'generate-eclipse-files' Ant target, the build path is set up to include all the libraries in build/lib/jars, but each library has ;C (semicolon, letter C) appended to it, so Eclipse can't find the libraries - there are about 55 errors like:
Project 'cassandra-0.8.1' is missing required library: '\Users\David\eclipse_workspace\cassandra-0.8.1\build\lib\jars\commons-cli-1.2.jar;C'
