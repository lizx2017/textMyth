Summary:
stress.java doesn't read more unique rows than 2x the number of threads
Description:
This can be observed by watching how much the row/key cache grows on each run. I'm not sure when this started or if it was always the case, but it's actually useful behavior when you want to benchmark just the cache, so it'd be nice to preserve as an option.
