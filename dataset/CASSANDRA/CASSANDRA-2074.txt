Summary:
Currently voted on 7.0.1 release won't start on windows
Description:
The proposed release (https://hudson.apache.org/hudson/job/Cassandra-0.7/228/) won't start on my windows dev machine running ecplise. (Haven't tested this on linux)
Startup parameters:
-Dcassandra.config=cassandra-test/cassandra.yaml
-ea -Xmx2G
It exists right after the following message, no ERROR message is shown. I also tried deleting all my data folders, but cassandra still exists.
INFO 18:02:09,690 Will not load MX4J, mx4j-tools.jar is not in the classpath
apache-cassandra-2011-01-24_06-01-26.jar works fine though.
