Summary:
sstable tools may result in commit log segments be written
Description:
There was a report of sstable2json causing commitlog segments to be written out when run. I haven't attempted to reproduce this yet, so that's all I know for now. Since sstable2json loads the conf and schema, I'm thinking that it may inadvertently be triggering the commitlog code.
sstablescrub, sstableverify, and other sstable tools have the same issue.
