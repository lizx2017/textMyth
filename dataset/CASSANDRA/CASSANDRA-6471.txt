Summary:
Executing a prepared CREATE KEYSPACE multiple times doesn't work
Description:
See user reports on the java driver JIRA: https://datastax-oss.atlassian.net/browse/JAVA-223. Preparing CREATE KEYSPACE queries is not particularly useful but there is no reason for it to be broken.
The reason is that calling KSPropDef/CFPropDef.validate() methods are not idempotent. Attaching simple patch to fix.
