Summary:
runWithCompactionsDisabled only cancels compactions, which is not the only source of markCompacted
Description:
Operations like repair that may operate over all sstables cancel compactions before beginning, and fail if there are any files marked compacting after doing so. Redistribution of index summaries is not a compaction, so is not cancelled by this action, but does mark sstables as compacting, so such an action will fail to initiate if there is an index summary redistribution in progress. It seems that IndexSummaryManager needs to register itself as interruptible along with compactions (AFAICT no other actions that may markCompacting are not themselves compactions).
