Summary:
limit disregarded when paging with IN clause under certain conditions
Description:
This issue was originally reported on the python-driver userlist and confirmed by Adam Holmberg
When:
page_size < limit < data size,
the limit value is disregarded and all rows are paged back.
to repro:
create a table and populate it with two partitions
CREATE TABLE paging_test ( id int, value text, PRIMARY KEY (id, value) )
Add data: in one partition create 10 rows, an in a second partition create 20 rows
perform a query with page_size of 10 and a LIMIT of 20, like so:
SELECT * FROM paging_test where id in (1,2) LIMIT 20;
The limit is disregarded and three pages of 10 records each will be returned.
