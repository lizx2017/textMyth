Summary:
ParentRepairSession potentially block ANTI_ENTROPY stage
Description:
Follow up from CASSANDRA-9151,
potentially block this stage again since many methods are synchronized in ActiveRepairService.
Methods prepareForRepair(could block for 1 hour for prepare message response) and finishParentSession(this one block for anticompaction to finish) are synchronized and could hold on to the lock for a long time.
In RepairMessageVerbHandler.doVerb, if there is an exception for another repair, removeParentRepairSession(also synchronized) will block.
