Summary:
Drain causes incorrect error messages: "Stream took more than 24H to complete; skipping"
Description:
After calling drain on a node, there are a bunch of incorrect error messages in the cassandra log file: "Stream took more than 24H to complete; skipping".
The problem is in MessagingService.waitForStreaming. It is logging an error if ThreadPoolExecutor.awaitTermination returns true, but if a timeout happens it returns false. See http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ThreadPoolExecutor.html#awaitTermination%28long,%20java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit%29
