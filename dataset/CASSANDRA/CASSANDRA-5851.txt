Summary:
Fix 2i on composite components omissions
Description:
There some edge-cases, not covered by CASSANDRA-5125, the attached patch fixes those:
(Assuming CREATE TABLE test (pk0 int, pk1 int, ck0 int, ck1 int, val int, PRIMARY KEY ((pk0, pk1), ck0, ck1)))
could not create a 2i on the first part of a composite partition key (pk0)
if created, it couldn't work because of getKeyBounds() returning non-empty bounds
could create an index on the first clustering key column (ck0), but it would never actually be triggered on reads
queries like SELECT * FROM test WHERE pk0 = x AND pk1 = y AND ck1 = z would throw an exception because COCK.makeIndexColumnNameBuilder() couldn't handle empty provided columnName
cqlsh could not describe any of these indexes because it was taking column aliases and key aliases from schema_columnfamilies and not reading them directly from schema_columns (had to do the related refactoring).
