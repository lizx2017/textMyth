Summary:
Streaming CommitLog backup
Description:
Problems with the current SST backups
1) The current backup doesn't allow us to restore point in time (within a SST)
2) Current SST implementation needs the backup to read from the filesystem and hence additional IO during the normal operational Disks
3) in 1.0 we have removed the flush interval and size when the flush will be triggered per CF,
For some use cases where there is less writes it becomes increasingly difficult to time it right.
4) Use cases which needs BI which are external (Non cassandra), needs the data in regular intervals than waiting for longer or unpredictable intervals.
Disadvantages of the new solution
1) Over head in processing the mutations during the recover phase.
2) More complicated solution than just copying the file to the archive.
Additional advantages:
Online and offline restore.
Close to live incremental backup.
Note: If the listener agent gets restarted, it is the agents responsibility to Stream the files missed or incomplete.
There are 3 Options in the initial implementation:
1) Backup -> Once a socket is connected we will switch the commit log and send new updates via the socket.
2) Stream -> will take the absolute path of the file and will read the file and send the updates via the socket.
3) Restore -> this will get the serialized bytes and apply's the mutation.
Side NOTE: (Not related to this patch as such) The agent which will take incremental backup is planned to be open sourced soon (Name: Priam).
