Summary:
Bootstrapping might skip needed ranges.
Description:
Bootstrapper.getRangeWithSources should return a multimap with as many keys as myRangeAddresses. But with the way the two loops are structured, they are not guaranteed to ever examine all of myRanges. To see why, consider a scenario where the inner-loop breaks on the first element in myRanges. myRangeAddresses will only ever have one key in it.
Solution is to swap the order of the loops.
