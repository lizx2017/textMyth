Summary:
Reading from table which contains collection type using token function and with CL > ONE causes overwhelming writes to replicas
Description:
When reading from a table at the aforementioned conditions, each read from replica also casues write to the replica.
Confimed in version 2.0.12 & 2.0.13, version 2.1.3 seems ok.
To reproduce:
CREATE KEYSPACE test WITH replication = {'class': 'NetworkTopologyStrategy', 'DC1': 2};
USE test;
CREATE TABLE bug(id int PRIMARY KEY, val map<int,int>);
INSERT INTO bug(id, val) VALUES (1, {2: 3});
CONSISTENCY LOCAL_QUORUM
TRACING ON
SELECT * FROM bug WHERE token(id) <= 0;
