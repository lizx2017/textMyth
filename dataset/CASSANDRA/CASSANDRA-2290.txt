Summary:
Repair hangs if one of the neighbor is dead
Description:
Repair don't cope well with dead/dying neighbors. There is 2 problems:
Repair don't check if a node is dead before sending a TreeRequest; this is easily fixable.
If a neighbor dies mid-repair, the repair will also hang forever.
The second point is not easy to deal with. The best approach is probably CASSANDRA-1740 however. That is, if we add a way to query the state of a repair, and that this query correctly check all neighbors and also add a way to cancel a repair, this would probably be enough.
