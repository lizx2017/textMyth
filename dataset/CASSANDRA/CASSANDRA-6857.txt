Summary:
SELECT DISTINCT with a LIMIT is broken by paging
Description:
The paging for RangeSliceCommand only support the case where we count CQL3 rows . However, in the case of SELECT DISTINCT, we do actually want to use the "count partitions, not CQL3 row" path and that's currently broken when the paging commands are used (this was first reported on the Java driver JIRA and there is a reproduction script there).
