Summary:
Anti-compaction is blocking ANTI_ENTROPY stage
Description:
In RepairMessageVerbHandler.doVerb case ANTICOMPACTION_REQUEST
We block on ANTI_ENTROPY stage. This is not good as no other message could be processed till any anticompaction is running. This can cause snapshots for new repairs to fail.
