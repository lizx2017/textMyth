Summary:
possible to have orphaned data files that never get deleted
Description:
startup looks for data files, then tries to load them
delete removes starting w/ the data file (so that if there is a partial delete, we don't panic on the next start b/c of missing index or bloom filter)
but this means that if we have a partial delete, the index/BF files can persist forever
