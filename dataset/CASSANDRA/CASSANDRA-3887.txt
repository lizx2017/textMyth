Summary:
NPE on start-up due to missing stage
Description:
On 1.1 (with our patches, but fairly sure they aren't involved):
 INFO [main] 2012-02-10 17:57:26,220 StorageService.java (line 768) JOINING: waiting for ring and schema information

ERROR [Thread-6] 2012-02-10 17:57:26,333 AbstractCassandraDaemon.java (line 139) Fatal exception in thread Thread[Thread-6,5,main]

That NPE is after an assertion (not triggered due to lack of -ea). Race on start-up - getting messages before stages set up? (not investigating further right now)
