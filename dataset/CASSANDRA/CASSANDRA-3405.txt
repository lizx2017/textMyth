Summary:
Row cache provider reported wrong in cassandra-cli
Description:
When doing "show schema;" in the CLI, the row_cache_provider is reported as ConcurrentLinkedHashCacheProvider while it really is SerializingCacheProvider
Same goes for "describe keyspace" (after CASSANDRA-3384) on the 0.8 branch
