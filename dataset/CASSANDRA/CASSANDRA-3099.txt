Summary:
Counters are not always hinted
Description:
CASSANDRA-2892 mistakenly removed some hints for counters, namely the hints that were supposed to be stored on the local node (that is, instead of removing from the hintedEndpoints multimap only the local write (since it has been already applied), we were removing everything having the local node as destination).
