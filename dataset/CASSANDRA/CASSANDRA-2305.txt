Summary:
Tombstoned rows not purged from cache after gcgraceseconds
Description:
From email to list:
I was wondering if this is the expected behavior of deletes (0.7.0). Let's say I have a 1-node cluster with a single CF which has gc_grace_seconds = 0. The following sequence of operations happens (in the given order):
insert row X with timestamp T
delete row X with timestamp T+1
force flush + compaction
insert row X with timestamp T
My understanding is that the tombstone created by the delete (and row X) will disappear with the flush + compaction which means the last insertion should show up. My experimentation, however, suggests otherwise (the last insertion does not show up).
I believe I have traced this to the fact that the markedForDeleteAt field on the ColumnFamily does not get reset after a compaction (after gc_grace_seconds has passed); is this desirable? I think it introduces an inconsistency in how tombstoned columns work versus tombstoned CFs. Thanks.
