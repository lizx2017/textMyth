Summary:
Thrift tables are not supported from CqlPagingInputFormat
Description:
CqlPagingInputFormat inspects the system schema to generate the WHERE clauses needed to page "wide rows," but for a classic Thrift table there are no entries for the "default" column names of key, column1, column2, ..., value so CPIF breaks.
