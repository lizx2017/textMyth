Summary:
Hinted handoff not working after rolling upgrade from 0.8.7 to 1.0.2
Description:
While testing rolling upgrades from 0.8.7 to 1.0.2 on a test cluster I've noticed that hinted hand-off didn't always work properly. Hints generated on an upgraded node does not seem to be delivered to other newly upgraded nodes once they rejoin the ring. They only way I've found to get a node to deliver its hints is to restart it.
Here's some steps to reproduce this issue:
1. Install cassandra 0.8.7 on node1 and node2 using default settings.
2. Create keyspace foo with
{replication_factor: 2}
. Create column family bar
3. Shutdown node2
4. Insert data into bar and verify that HintsColumnFamily on node2 contains hints
5. Start node2 and verify that hinted handoff is performed and HintsColumnFamily becomes empty again.
6. Upgrade and restart node1
7. Shutdown node2
8. Insert data into bar and verify that HintsColumnFamily on node2 contains hints
9. Upgrade and start node2
10. Notice that hinted handoff is not performed when "node2" comes back. (Only if node1 is restarted)
