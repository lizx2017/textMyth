Summary:
Hinted HandOff are not delivered correctly following change to ByteBuffer
Description:
In trunk (rc1-snapshot), I get a Fatal Exception during hints delivery, the exception being:
java.lang.RuntimeException: Corrupted hint name java.nio.HeapByteBuffer[pos=0 lim=22 cap=22]
This is due to a misuse of the 3rd parameter of ArrayUtils.lastIndexOf.
