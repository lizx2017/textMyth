Summary:
UDT schema change messages are indistinguishable from table schema changes
Description:
With the v2 protocol, schema change messages (both responses and pushed notifications) for UDT changes are indistinguishable from table changes. This means that drivers using the v2 protocol may not properly detect type changes. Additionally, if a table and a UDT share the same name and the UDT is dropped, the driver may interpret this as the table being dropped.
The best solution seems to be to use "keyspace updated" messages for UDT changes when using the v2 protocol.
