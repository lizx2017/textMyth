Summary:
Fix LazilyCompactedRowTest
Description:
LazilyCompactedRowTest.testTwoRowSuperColumn has never really worked. It uses LazilyCompactedRowTest.assertBytes() that assumes standard columns, even though that test is for super columns. For some reason, the deserialization of the super columns as columns was not breaking stuff and so the test was "working", but CASSANDRA-3872 changed that and LazilyCompactedRowTest.testTwoRowSuperColumn fails on current cassandra-1.1 branch (but it's not CASSANDRA-3872 fault, just the test that is buggy).
