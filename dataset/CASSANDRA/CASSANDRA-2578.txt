Summary:
stress performance is artificially limited
Description:
With stress I only get about 7k inserts/s against a single server, and the load and cpu usage from stress is higher than the server. Pystress gets 15-20k inserts/s against the same machine. Stress isn't cpu-limited however, so there must be something else holding it back.
