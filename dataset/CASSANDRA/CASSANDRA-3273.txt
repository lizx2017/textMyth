Summary:
FailureDetector can take a very long time to mark a host down
Description:
There are two ways to trigger this:
Bring a node up very briefly in a mixed-version cluster and then terminate it
Bring a node up, terminate it for a very long time, then bring it back up and take it down again
In the first case, what can happen is a very short interval arrival time is recorded by the versioning logic which requires reconnecting and can happen very quickly. This can easily be solved by rejecting any intervals within a reasonable bound, for instance the gossiper interval.
The second instance is harder to solve, because what is happening is that an extremely large interval is recorded, which is the time the node was left dead the first time. This throws off the mean of the intervals and causes it to take a much longer time than it should to mark it down the second time.
