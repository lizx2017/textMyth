Summary:
Fix misuse of DataOutputBuffer.getData in AntiEntropyService
Description:
As reported by Schubert Zhang, AntiEntropyService is ignoring the length of the input buffer.
byte[] rowhash = FBUtilities.hash("SHA-256", row.key.key.getBytes(), row.buffer.getData());
While this isn't affecting our accuracy, it would break validation if we started reusing buffers in CompactedRow. This issue has already been fixed in 0.7.
