Summary:
Truncate can (in theory) lead to corrupt responses to client or segfault
Description:
Noticed this while searching for another problem. I don't have a unit test exhibiting it, as it would be non-trivial to add (needs a high rate burn test of writes, reads, truncates and non-snapshotted CFs). We can perhaps file a follow-up ticket to address that, however the kitchen sink tests will hopefully cover this ground.
