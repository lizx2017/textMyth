Summary:
Table comments indicates expiry checking happens 10x times per minimum interval, but doesn't
Description:
Minor point, the there is a comment in the body of the Table constructor that claims it checks 10x as often to not miss the deadline by more than 10%. It seems to me that either the comment should be removed, or a change is necessary to make it true (trivial patch attached).
