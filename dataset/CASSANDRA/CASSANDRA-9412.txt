Summary:
Cleanup cqlsh help text for Grant/Revoke
Description:
Following up earlier discussion with Sam. The help text for Grant and Revoke in cqlsh displays the target as
TO [ROLE <rolename> | USER <username>]
but should be just
TO <roleOrUsername> 
There are also out of date comments in Cql.g on grantRoleStatement and revokeRoleStatement that indicate a ROLE keyword is used in these statements when that is no longer the case.
