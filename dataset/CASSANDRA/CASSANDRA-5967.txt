Summary:
Allow local batchlog writes for CL.ANY
Description:
We tell people that ANY means you can write if even a single node is reachable. We should apply that to batchlog writes as well.
Note: we already allow local batchlog writes for any single-node datacenter; batchlog writes are synchronous, so cross-dc latency would be slow enough to be unusable.
