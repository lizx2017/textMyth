Summary:
CommitLogArchiver thread pool name inconsistent with others
Description:
Pretty trivial... The names of all ThreadPoolExecutors are in CamelCase except the CommitLogArchiver as commitlog_archiver. This shows up a little more obvious in tpstats output:
nodetool tpstats

Seems minor enough to update this to be CommitLogArchiver but it may mean changes in any monitoring applications (although I don't think this particular pool has had much runtime or monitoring needs).
