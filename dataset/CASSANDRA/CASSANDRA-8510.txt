Summary:
CompactionManager.submitMaximal may leak resources
Description:
Once an AbstractCompactionTask is created it MUST be executed for its resources to be cleaned up, however here a collection of AbstractCompactionTask are constructed; if any of them yield an exception the remainder will not be executed and their resources leaked. Somebody with experience of compaction should decide how best to deal with this: either release the resources manually on an exception or always execute each task.
