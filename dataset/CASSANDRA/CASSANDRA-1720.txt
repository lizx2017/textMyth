Summary:
DecoratedKey equals() only tests Token
Description:
I'm working on a new Partitioner for Lucandra that lets many keys share the same token.
When I use this partitioner SliceQueryFilter class returns all rows that match key with the same Token. This isn't correct in my mind.
Tokens should only be used to route a Key in the ring. DecoratedKey equals() hashCode() and compare() should consider Token and Key
Thoughts?
