Summary:
make cassandra not allow itself to run out of memory during sustained inserts
Description:
Tv on IRC pointed out to me that the issue that I've been encountering
is probably point 2. in this roadmap:
http://www.mail-archive.com/cassandra-dev@incubator.apache.org/msg00160.html
I was unable to find any existing issue for this topic, so I'm creating a new one.
Since this issue would block our use of Cassandra I'm happy to look into it,
but if this is a known issue perhaps there's already a plan for addressing it
that could be clarified?
