Summary:
index scan should treat not-present columns as not matching index expressions
Description:
As reported on the mailing list,
I created a column family and added index on column A,B,C. 

Now I insert three rows. 

row1 : A=123, B=456, C=789 
row2 : A=123, C=789 
row3 : A=123, B=789, C=789 

Now if I perform an indexed query for A=123 and B=456, both row1 and row2 are returned.
