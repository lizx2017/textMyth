Summary:
requiring --debug to see stack traces for failures in cassandra-cli is a terrible idea (aka silent failure is never a valid option)
Description:
this manifests itself in cassandra-cli by returning null to the user. In order to see what the problem was (and in many cases, just to know there was a problem at all) requires running cassandra-cli with "--debug"
