Summary:
Adler32 Digests for Compressed SSTables are Incorrect
Description:
ChecksumWriter append() calculates the checksum of a buffer, then also writes that checksum as an int into the provided DataOutput. The final call to writeFullChecksum will have the checksum of all of the buffers, but none of the intermediate int checksums.
This issue was discovered (and a fix proposed) in #5791 - if the patch for #5791 is not accepted, some fix for src/java/org/apache/cassandra/io/util/DataIntegrityMetadata.java should be applied.
