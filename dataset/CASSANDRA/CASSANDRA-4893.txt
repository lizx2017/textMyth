Summary:
Don't throw internal exceptions over JMX
Description:
Similarly to how we don't return internal objects over JMX we shouldn't throw internal exceptions over jmx as well.
The one example I encountered was throwing ConfigurationException for the move() command. We should check the rest of our jmx as well.
