Summary:
CQL token(id) does not work in DELETE statements
Description:
When I try to delete a row by the token of the primary key, this happens:
cqlsh> delete from keyspace.table where token(id) = 0x478e5222f7484a5596344392e4451d59;
Bad Request: Invalid HEX constant (0x478e5222f7484a5596344392e4451d59) for id of type uuid
I'm using a blob-type because my data is highly organized, so I'm running a ByteOrderedPartitioner. This isn't a major issue, but it will save me a bit of coding hassle and cpu cycles to not be converting in and out of uuid's.
Also, I find it curious that the ByteOrderedPartitioner stores values as blob, but returns them as uuid - although I imagine this discussion took place long before I got here. Might there be a way to set Cassandra to deal solely with blobs? Or at least to return a uuid as blob?
