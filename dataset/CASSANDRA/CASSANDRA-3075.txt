Summary:
Cassandra CLI unable to use list command with INTEGER column names, resulting in syntax error
Description:
I have a Column Family named 1105115.
I have inserted the CF with Hector, and it did not
throw any exception concerning the name of the
column.
If I am issuing the command
list 1105115;
I incur the following error:
[default@unknown] list 1105115;
Syntax error at position 5: mismatched input '1105115' expecting Identifier
I presume we are not to name CFs as integers?
Or is there something I am missing from
the bellow help content:
[default@unknown] help list;
list <cf>;
list <cf>[<startKey>:];
list <cf>[<startKey>:<endKey>];
list <cf>[<startKey>:<endKey>] limit <limit>;
List a range of rows, and all of their columns, in the specified column
family.
The order of rows returned is dependant on the Partitioner in use.
Required Parameters:
cf: Name of the column family to list rows from.
Optional Parameters:
endKey: Key to end the range at. The end key will be included
in the result. Defaults to an empty byte array.
limit: Number of rows to return. Default is 100.
startKey: Key start the range from. The start key will be
included in the result. Defaults to an empty byte array.
Examples:
list Standard1;
list Super1[j:];
list Standard1[j:k] limit 40;
