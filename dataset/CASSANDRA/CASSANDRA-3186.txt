Summary:
nodetool should not NPE when rack/dc info is not yet available
Description:
As the title says. What happens is the persisted ring is loaded, but if those nodes are down and you're using a snitch like ec2 that gets rack/dc info from gossip, nodetool NPEs instead of showing that the node is down.
