Summary:
Auth.setup() is called too early
Description:
Auth.setup() triggers a request against the system_auth keyspace, request that is not an internal one, so it at least require TokenMetadata to be set up. However, Auth.setup() is call much too early, even before the commit log is replayed. The only reason this doesn't trigger an assertionError everytime is because Auth.setup() actually only schedul it's request after RING_DELAY, but still, replaying the commit log can take much more than that, and even without that I suspect this would be racy with normal bootstrap.
