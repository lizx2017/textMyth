Summary:
fix regression in 1968 (young gen sizing logic)
Description:
1968 introduced a regression (there was still cleanup to do). In particular it broke when an explicit MAX_HEAP_SIZE was set. Attaching draft patch (needs more testing).
Allowing automatic newsize calculation in the face of a manually specified MAX_HEAP_SIZE was problematic. Either one has to duplicate JVM parsing of MAX_HEAP_SIZE or ask the user to set MAX_HEAP_SIZE_IN_MB (or similar) instead.
In this patch (consider it a draft) i opted for the latter + picking up MAX_HEAP_SIZE for backwards compatibility (but with the effect that it disables new size calculation). I tried to make it slightly more posixly correct, but as usual no guarantees given that I have no posix shell to test it on.
I'm not really happy about the shell acrobatics and my confidence that there is not some left-over issue is not high. Should we just not worry about MAX_HEAP_SIZE compatibility and remove all that compatibility cruft? Plenty of acrobatics left still, but it would remove the more hideous parts.
