Summary:
Core Dump while running long duration CommitLogStressTest
Description:
After 13 hours, a core dump occurred.

I don't have much information for now since the jenkins job was not set to grab any logs from a core dump. The test has been restarted this morning and I will be able to get the core dump log that time if it fails.
