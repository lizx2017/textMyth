Summary:
Unify ARE#makeDataRequests() and ARE#makeDigestRequests()
Description:
Two methods should be essentially the same, yet CASSANDRA-4718 gave madeDataRequests() some preferential treatment - confusing at least one person in the process.
The attached patch cleans up and unifies both methods.
Will not include in CHANGES.txt.
