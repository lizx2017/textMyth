Summary:
Failed to delete commitlog when restarting service
Description:
When restarting any Cassandra node we've got exception:
ERROR 09:42:27,869 Exception encountered during startup.
java.io.IOException: Failed to delete C:\cassandra\data\commitlog\CommitLog-1280817512228.log

INFO 09:42:27,869 Cassandra Service Finished: Tue Aug 03 09:42:27 EEST 2010
Aftrer exception was thrown and Cassandra didn't started, within commitlog directory there's only one file: CommitLog-1280817512228.log
and no CommitLog-1280817512228.log.header. Looks like CommitLog-1280817512228.log was a new file, not the last one after stopping service.
After few restarts .log file is deleted and Cassandra is working fine until next restart.
