Summary:
Better debian packaging permissions
Description:
The debian package creates a cassandra user for the process to run as. It chowns /var/lib/cassandra and /var/log/cassandra, but it doesn't grant group level access to these files. It should do a 'chown cassandra:cassandra ...' so that users in the cassandra group can also access those files. Also we should chown /etc/cassandra and any other files/directories created.
