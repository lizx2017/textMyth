Summary:
The Pig CqlStorage/AbstractCassandraStorage classes don't handle collection types
Description:
The CqlStorage class gets the Pig data type for values from the AbstractCassandraStorage class, in the getPigType method. If it isn't a known data type, it makes the value into a ByteArray. Currently there aren't any cases there for lists, maps, and sets.

See this describe output from the grunt shell:
grunt> describe listdata ;                                        
listdata: {id: (name: chararray,value: int),alist: (name: chararray,value: bytearray),amap: (name: chararray,value: bytearray),aset: (name: chararray,value: bytearray)}
where the cql data structures had this schema:
CREATE TABLE alltypes (
  id int PRIMARY KEY,
  alist list<text>,
  amap map<text, text>,
  aset set<text>
It turns out that if you cast the map in grunt to a pig map, then it sort of works, but I don't think we should probably use a pig map. Lists don't appear to work at all, as there is no Pig analogue. I think you could probably just do a UDF to cast these things, but we already have all of the type information, so we just need to change them to tuples or bags or whatever.
