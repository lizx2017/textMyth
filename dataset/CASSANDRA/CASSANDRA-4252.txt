Summary:
Set operation mode to MOVING earlier
Description:
Right now when moving a node we set the OperationMode only once we've calculated the necessary ranges to transfer and if there actually are ranges to transfer. Due to the sleep for ring settling this means there are 30 seconds where the node is moving but the operation mode isn't set accordingly. Additionally if it turns out no data needs to be transferred then the move will complete without ever switching the OperationMode to moving.
