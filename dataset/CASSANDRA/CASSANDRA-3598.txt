Summary:
Index Scan's will span across multiple DC's
Description:
Looks like we send requests to all the nodes provided by StorageService.instance.getLiveNaturalEndpoints(keyspace, range.right);
We dont filter it based on blockedFor (Consistency levels).
In a multi DC setup this will cause unnecessary load on the other DC. And even within a DC we might query more nodes than needed.
