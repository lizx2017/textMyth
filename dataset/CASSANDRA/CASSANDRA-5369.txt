Summary:
cqlsh drops characters from script files with wrong version of the Python libedit (readline) library
Description:
If an python installation has the wrong version of readline, cqlsh does not allow non-ascii characters such as in the word "caf√©". When reading a script, cqlsh simply drops those characters out of the script. In my case, the script contained insert statements, and C* thereby inserted bad data. cqlsh needs to throw if there is a version of readline that exhibits this behavior. This behavior was exhibited in my version of OSX 10.8
It was remedied by upgrading readline:
