Summary:
Notify clients that bootstrap is finished over binary protocol
Description:
Currently, Cassandra will notify clients when a new node is added to a cluster. However, that node is typically not usable yet. It first needs to gossip its key range and finish loading all its assigned data before it allows clients to connect. Depending on the amount of data this may take quite a while. The clients in the mean time have no clue about the bootstrap status of that node. The only thing they can do is periodically check if it will accept a connection.
My proposal would be to send an additional UP event when the bootstrap is done, this allows clients to mark the node initially as down/unavailable and simply wait for the UP event to arrive.
Kind regards,
Joost
