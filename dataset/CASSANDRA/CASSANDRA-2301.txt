Summary:
OOM on repair with many inconsistent ranges
Description:
Repair can OOM when lots of ranges are inconsistent, causing many sstables to be streamed.
I replicated the error by making 1264 3MB sstables on one node, added a second node, changed the replication factor to 2, and ran a repair.
Looking at the heap dump of the original failure, there were 2.4GB of FutureTasks, each taking up 8MB of space. I tracked down the BufferedRandomAccessFile and made sure that it was cleared every time it was closed inside of src/java/org/apache/cassandra/io/sstable/SSTableWriter.java.
Attached is the patch I used which stopped the error when I was trying to replicate it.
