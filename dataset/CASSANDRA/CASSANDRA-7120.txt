Summary:
Bad paging state returned for prepared statements for last page
Description:
When executing a paged query with a prepared statement, a non-null paging state is sometimes being returned for the final page, causing an endless paging loop.
Specifically, this is the schema being used:
    CREATE KEYSPACE test3rf WITH replication = {'class': 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor': '3'}';
    USE test3rf;
    CREATE TABLE test3rf.test (
                k int PRIMARY KEY,
                v int
    )
The inserts are like so:
INSERT INTO test3rf.test (k, v) VALUES (?, 0)
With values from [0, 99] used for k.
The query is SELECT * FROM test3rf.test with a fetch size of 3.
The final page returns the row with k=3, and the paging state is 0004000000420004000176007fffffa2. This matches the paging state from three pages earlier. When executing this with a non-prepared statement, no paging state is returned for this page.
This problem doesn't happen with the 2.0 branch.
