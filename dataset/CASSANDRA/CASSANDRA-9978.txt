Summary:
Split/Scrub tools no longer remove original sstable
Description:
Looks like CASSANDRA-7066 broke the scrub and split tools. The orig sstable is no longer removed.
I fixed the sstablesplit dtest so you should see the issue now. The max sstable size doesn't match expected because it's the original
