Summary:
parse_for_table_meta errors out on queries with undefined grammars
Description:
CASSANDRA-6910 introduced changes to the cqlsh function parse_for_table_meta that cause an error to be thrown whenever a query does not have its grammar defined in cql3handling.py. However, this is affecting queries that are legitimate cql syntax and are accepted by Cassandra, but aren't defined in cqlsh.
