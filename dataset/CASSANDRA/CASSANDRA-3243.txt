Summary:
Node which was decommissioned and shut-down reappears on a single node
Description:
I decommissioned a node several days ago. It was no longer in the ring list on any node in the ring. However, it was in the dead gossip list.
In an attempt to clean it out of the dead gossip list so I could truncate, I shut down the entire ring and bought it back up. Once the ring came back up, one node showed the decommissioned node as still in the ring in a state of 'Down'. No other node in the ring shows this info.
I successfully ran removetoken on the node to get that phantom node out. However, it is back in the dead gossip list, preventing me from truncating.
Where might the info on this decommissioned node be being stored? Is HH possibly trying to deliver to the removed node, thus putting it back in the ring on one node?
I find it extremely curious that none of the other nodes in the ring showed the phantom node. Shouldn't gossip have propagated the node everywhere, even if it was down?
