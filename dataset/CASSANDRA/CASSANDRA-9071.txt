Summary:
CQLSSTableWriter gives java.lang.AssertionError: Empty partition
Description:
I am always getting the following error:
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.AssertionError: Empty partition
at org.apache.cassandra.io.sstable.SSTableSimpleUnsortedWriter$DiskWriter.run(SSTableSimpleUnsortedWriter.java:228)
It happens at a certain point that seems to be repeatable. Only issue is I am converting 400 million records into multiple SSTables and creating small test is a challenge
Last comment from Benedict looks relevant here https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-8619
Is there a work around, quick fix, fix that I can try out locally?
Thanks,
-Ajit
