Summary:
nodetool statusthrift exception while node starts up
Description:
We noticed when calling nodetool statusthrift, while a node is starting up, it throws an exception. I think the proper behavior should be just return false, instead of throwing an exception if RPC server hasn't started yet. That way this stack trace won't have to be thrown in nodetool:
Exception in thread "main"
java.lang.IllegalStateException: No configured RPC daemon
