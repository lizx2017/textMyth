Summary:
Race condition silently kills thrift server
Description:
There's a race condition in CustomTThreadPoolServer that can cause the thrift server to silently stop listening for connections.
It happens when the executor service throws a RejectedExecutionException, which is not caught.
Silent in the sense that OpsCenter doesn't notice any problem since JMX is still running fine.
