Summary:
cql3 ALTER TABLE ALTER TYPE has no effect
Description:
running the following with cql3:
CREATE TABLE test (foo text PRIMARY KEY, bar int);
ALTER TABLE test ALTER bar TYPE float;
does not actually change the column type of bar. It does under cql2.
Note that on the current cassandra-1.1.0 HEAD, this causes an NPE, fixed by CASSANDRA-4163. But even with that applied, the ALTER shown here has no effect.
