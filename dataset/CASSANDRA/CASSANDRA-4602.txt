Summary:
Stack Size on Sun JVM 1.6.0_33 must be at least 160k
Description:
I started a fresh Cassandra 1.1.4 install with Sun JVM 1.6.35.
On startup I got this in output.log
The stack size specified is too small, Specify at least 160k
Cannot create Java VM
Service exit with a return value of 1
Remembering CASSANDRA-4275 I monkeyed around and started the JVM with -Xss160k the same as Java 7. I then got
ERROR [WRITE-/192.168.1.12] 2012-08-31 01:43:29,865 AbstractCassandraDaemon.java (line 134) Exception in thread Thread[WRITE-/192.168.1.12,5,main]

Same as CASSANDRA-4442
At which point I dropped back to Java 6.33.
CASSANDRA-4457 bumped the stack size to 180 for java 7, should we also do this for Java 6.33+ ?
