Summary:
IndexSummaryManagerTest.testCompactionsRace intermittently timing out on trunk
Description:
Keep running it repeatedly w/showoutput="yes" in build.xml on junit and you'll see it time out with:
    [junit] WARN  17:02:56 Unable to cancel in-progress compactions for StandardRace.  Perhaps there is an unusually large row in progress somewhere, or the system is simply overloaded.

    [junit] WARN  17:02:57 Unable to cancel in-progress compactions for StandardRace.  Perhaps there is an unusually large row in progress somewhere, or the system is simply overloaded.

I originally thought this was a Windows specific problem (CASSANDRA-8962) but can reproduce on linux by just repeatedly running the test.
