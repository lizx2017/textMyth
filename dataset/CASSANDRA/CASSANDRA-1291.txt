Summary:
nodetool ring prints incorrect IP address
Description:
Nodetool's ring output on trunk seems to duplicate an ipaddress instead of printing them all.
To reproduce: spin up a 3 node cluster and create a keyspace, examine nodetool ring. One ip address will show up twice, though the tokens are correctly displayed for the three machines.
This is a cosmetic error, if you call getLiveNodes via JMX you can see all three IPs.
