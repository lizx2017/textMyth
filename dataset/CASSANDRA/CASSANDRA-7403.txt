Summary:
Reconciliation doesn't consider fields specific to expiring cells
Description:
Reconciling 2 ExpiringColumns which are equal in every way except for the localExpirationTime field will always favour the instance on which reconcile is called as fields specific to expiration are not considered.
This is actually beneficial in pre-2.1 versions as in AtomicSortedColumns.Holder.addColumn we call reconcile on the new column, which 'wins' the reconcilliation and so the localExpirationTime is effectively extended.
From 2.1 onwards, reconcile is actually called on the existing value (in BTreeSortedColumns.ColumnUpdater) and so it wins the reconcilliation and the ttl doesn't get extended. The same thing happens in the iterator returned from MergeIterator.Reducer.getReducer() so we see the same behaviour when merging cells from the multiple SSTables and/or memtables.
