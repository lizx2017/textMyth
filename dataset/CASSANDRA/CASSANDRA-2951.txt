Summary:
FreeableMemory can be accessed after it is invalid
Description:
SerializingCache.get looks like this:
    public V get(Object key)
    {
        FreeableMemory mem = map.get(key);
        if (mem == null)
            return null;
        return deserialize(mem);
    }
If a cache object is evicted or replaced after the get happens, but before deserialize completes, we will trigger an assertion failure (if asserts are enabled) or segfault (if they are not).
