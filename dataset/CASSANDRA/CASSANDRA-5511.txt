Summary:
Clean up backwards compatibility complexity for 2.0
Description:
We've supported rolling upgrades (network-compatible for read/write operations) for several releases, but both 1.0 -> 1.1 and 1.1 -> 1.2 required being on a recent release of the immediately prior major series for this to work as desired.
Meanwhile, we still support reading sstables at least back to 0.6 and possibly even earlier. This makes dealing with changes to the sstable quite challenging; the recently written-and-reverted CASSANDRA-5487 comes to mind.
2.0 is a good place to drop support for sstables older than 1.2.5. Our experience with network compatibility demonstrates that this is not an unreasonable burden to impose, and the major version number change suggests that this is a logical time to make such a change.
