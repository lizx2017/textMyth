Summary:
Compaction timestamp captured incorrectly in Compaction History table
Description:
Compaction finish time is incorrectly captured using System.nanoTime() before the compaction is triggered. The finish time should be captured using System.currentTimeMillis() as per #4432. The suggested patch captures using FBUtilities.timestampMicros() after the compaction completes.
This however doesn't fix the formatting of timestamp values by
cqlsh which throws decoding errors as below:
Failed to format value NNN.. as timestamp: timestamp out of range for platform time_t
