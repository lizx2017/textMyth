Summary:
SELECT queries broken for Thrift-created tables with non-string comparators
Description:
CFMetaData.getColumnNameType() is broken, which in turn breaks ColumnIdentifier.Raw.prepare().
Basically, the logic of it is incorrect - we should be returning the type of the clustering column, not of the REGULAR value one.
See ThriftCompatibilityTest after this commit.
