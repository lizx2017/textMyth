Summary:
Failure to delete column families
Description:
I have a two node cluster, and one keyspace defined as follows:
create keyspace SampleKeyspace with placement_strategy = 'org.apache.cassandra.locator.SimpleStrategy' and strategy_options =
{replication_factor:2}
;
I then create a column family as follows:
create column family SampleFamily with caching = 'keys_only' and key_validation_class = 'LongType' and compression_options =
{ sstable_compression: SnappyCompressor, chunk_length_kb: 64 }
I stream SSTables through SStableLoader.
After the load is complete, compaction begins. During this time, I request a drop of the family through cassandra-cli using "drop column family SampleFamily".
Cassandra-cli responds that schemas are in agreement. Looking on the file system, however, the full set of data files are still found under data/SampleFamily (in addition to the snapshot created on drop family). There are no errors in either system or output logs.
