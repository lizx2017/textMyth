Summary:
Multiple migrations might run at once
Description:
The service.MigrationManager class manages a MIGRATION_STAGE where nodes should execute db.migration.Migration instances.
The problem is that the node that a client connects to via Thrift or Avro initiates the migration in their client thread (calls migration.apply). Instead, the Thrift and Avro clients should ensure that the migration occurs in MIGRATION_STAGE, and should block until the migration is applied by the stage.
