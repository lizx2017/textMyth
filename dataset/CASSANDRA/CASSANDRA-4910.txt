Summary:
CQL3 doesn't allow static CF definition with compact storage in C* 1.1
Description:
In Cassandra 1.1, the following CQL3 definition:
CREATE TABLE user_profiles (
    user_id text PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name text,
    last_name text,
    year_of_birth int
) WITH COMPACT STORAGE;
yields:
Bad Request: COMPACT STORAGE requires at least one column part of the clustering key, none found
This works fine in 1.2 however.
