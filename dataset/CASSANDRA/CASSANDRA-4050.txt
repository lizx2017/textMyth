Summary:
Rewrite RandomAccessReader to use FileChannel / nio to address Windows file access violations
Description:
On Windows w/older java I/O libraries the files are not opened with FILE_SHARE_DELETE. This causes problems as hard-links cannot be deleted while the original file is opened - our snapshots are a big problem in particular. The nio library and FileChannels open with FILE_SHARE_DELETE which should help remedy this problem.
Original text:
I'm using Cassandra 1.0.8, on Windows 7. When I take a snapshot of the database, I find that I am unable to delete the snapshot directory (i.e., dir named "
{datadir}
{keyspacename}\snapshots{snapshottag}") while Cassandra is running: "The action can't be completed because the folder or a file in it is open in another program. Close the folder or file and try again" [in Windows Explorer]. If I terminate Cassandra, then I can delete the directory with no problem.
I expect to be able to move or delete the snapshotted files while Cassandra is running, as this should not affect the runtime operation of Cassandra.
