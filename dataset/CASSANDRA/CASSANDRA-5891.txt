Summary:
Scrub disk footprint needs to be reduced
Description:
Currently scrub creates a snapshot at the beginning of the scrub. This causes the disk used to be doubled after the scrub.
If the disk utilization is more than 50%, scrub wont work. It would be nice to have an overriding option to disable snapshot. Something like --no-snapshot.
