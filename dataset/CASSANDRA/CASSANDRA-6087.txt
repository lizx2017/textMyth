Summary:
Node OOMs on commit log replay when starting up
Description:
After some activity on batchlogs and hints and CFs restarted nodes without finished draining. On startup it OOMs.
Investigating it found, that memtables occupied all available RAM, because MeteredFlusher is started later in setup code, so memtables cannot flush.
Fixed by starting metered flusher before commit log replay starts
