Summary:
updating strategy_options has no effect
Description:
updating the strategy_options with cassandra-cli does not actually do anything:
[default@unknown] use mt2;
Authenticated to keyspace: mt2
[default@mt2] update keyspace mt2 with placement_strategy = 'NetworkTopologyStrategy' and strategy_options =
{OVH:1, FALKENSTEIN:1}
;

Waiting for schema agreement...
... schemas agree across the cluster
[default@mt2] show schema;
create keyspace mt2
with placement_strategy = 'NetworkTopologyStrategy'
and strategy_options =
{OVH : 2, FALKENSTEIN : 0}
and durable_writes = true;
the strategy_options were not updated.
