Summary:
When dropping a CF, row cache is not invalidated
Description:
When dropping a ColumnFamily with row cache enabled, then row cache is not invalidated for this CF.
This can be a bit annoying if the ColumnFamily is recreated because it will be empty, but row cache won't.
Note : this is similar to a "TRUNCATE" command (and TRUNCATE does invalidate the cache...)
Attached is patch which removes the rows of the currently dropped CF from row cache.
