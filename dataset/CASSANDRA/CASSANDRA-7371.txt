Summary:
DELETEs get lost
Description:
The mentioned commit introduced a bug which is not easy to reproduce:
Workload description:
One INSERT into a table
multiple concurrent SELECTs against different tables (one select returns a result)
One UPDATE against the same table as the INSERT
(same) multiple concurrent SELECTs against different tables (one select returns a result)
One DELETE against the same table as the INSERT
(same) multiple concurrent SELECTs against different tables
Expected is that the last bunch of SELECTs returns no result. But since commit SHA the DELETE gets not processed.
To clarify - the DELETE is not delayed - it is not executed at all.
Checked against a single node C* "cluster".
Does only affect unreleased 2.1 - not 2.0 nor 1.2.
