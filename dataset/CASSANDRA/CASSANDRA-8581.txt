Summary:
Null pointer in cassandra.hadoop.ColumnFamilyRecoderWriter
Description:
When I run examples/hadoop_word_count. I find that ReducerToFilesystem is correct but when I use ReducerToCassandra, the program will call loadYaml().
The reason is that the program catch a exception at line 196 of ColumnFamilyRecoderWriter.java.
Then it check why the exception occur, then it loadYaml to check if the disk is broken...
However, the exception is NullPointerException. because the client is not initialized.
So we need a check to judge whether the client is null.
(
The exception, original code and fixed code are in the attachments.
