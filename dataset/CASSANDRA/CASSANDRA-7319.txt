Summary:
Fix availability validation for LOCAL_ONE CL
Description:
ConsistencyLevel#assureSufficientLiveNodes() is currently broken wrt LOCAL_ONE (unlike ConsistencyLevel#isSufficientLiveNodes()). Because of this it's possible for a read request to go to a node in a non-local DC if there are no live replicas in the local DC (writes are also affected).
