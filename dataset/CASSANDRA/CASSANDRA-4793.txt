Summary:
Commitlog files replayed but not in the order of their ids
Description:
I noticed that the commitlog files were not replayed in the order of their ids.
It seems that they are sorted by "last modification date" before being replayed, but this does not corresponds to their ids.
Moreover, "last modification date" is changed when a file is copied, so, this could also change the order of archived commitlogs.
Maybe it's safer to sort them using the id in the file name ?
