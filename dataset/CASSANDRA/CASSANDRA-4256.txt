Summary:
Include stress tool in debian packaging
Description:
The stress tool isn't included in the debian packaging. We need to update that to grab the stress shell script as well as put the stress.jar file in lib.
Also the stress shell script needs to be updated to include looking in /usr/share/cassandra... when searching for the stress jar so it will run in packaged installations.
