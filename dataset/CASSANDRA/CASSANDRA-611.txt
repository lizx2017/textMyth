Summary:
Fix Findbugs: Replace keySet w entrySet
Description:
A lot of places in the codebase, we iterate over the keySet() of a Map, and call get() for each key. For a HashMap, this is still O(N), but when you are dealing with a SortedMap, this is O(NlogN). The list of occurences are attached.
Fixing this issue should give us a general (minor?) performance boost.
In order to find unused method parameters for CASSANDRA-608, I ran FindBugs against Cassandra, and found a few interesting issues we ought to explore (but not the unused method params, oi.)
