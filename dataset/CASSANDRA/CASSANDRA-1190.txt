Summary:
Remove automatic repair sessions
Description:
Currently both manual and automatic repair sessions use the same timeout value: TREE_STORE_TIMEOUT. This has the very negative effect of setting a maximum time that compaction can take before a manual repair will fail.
For automatic/natural repairs (triggered by two nodes autonomously finishing major compactions around the same time), you want a relatively low TREE_STORE_TIMEOUT value, because trees generated a long time apart will cause a lot of unnecessary repair. The current value is 10 minutes, to optimize for this case.
On the other hand, for manual repairs, TREE_STORE_TIMEOUT needs to be significantly higher. For instance, if a manual repair is triggered for a source node A storing 2 TB of data, and a destination node B with an empty store, then node B needs to wait long enough for node A to finish compacting 2 TB of data, which might take > 12 hours. If a node B times out the local tree before node A sends its tree, then the repair will not occur.
