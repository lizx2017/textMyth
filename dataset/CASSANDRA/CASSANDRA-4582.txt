Summary:
in cqlsh the output of describe columnfamily doesn't convert to hex
Description:
When the comparator=blob, cqlsh is outputting the metadata for column names in utf8. Instead it should output them in hex because that's what will make it so its output can be used to re-create the column family. Granted it's going to be pretty unreadable for the user, but it will work to re-create the CF.
