Summary:
Droppable tombstones are not being removed from LCS table despite being above 20%
Description:
JMX is showing that one of our CQL3 LCS tables has a droppable tombstone ratio above 20% and increasing (currently at 28%). Compactions are not falling behind and we are using the OOTB setting for this feature so I would expect not to go above 20% (will attach screen shot from JMX). Table description:
CREATE TABLE global_user (
user_id timeuuid,
app_id int,

extra_param map<text, text>,

PRIMARY KEY (user_id, app_id, type, name)
