Summary:
Mixed line endings in the codebase
Description:
There seems to be a lot of line endings in the codebase that end with DOS line endings. Some files are even mixes of DOS and Unix line endings. This patch removes all the DOS file endings and corrects them to Unix.
Also attached is the program that I used to remove them.
Using Unix line endings in all places makes lots of things easier. At the very least, a consistent choice of line endings would. Has there been discussion of what should be the correct line ending to use?
