Summary:
Error in CLI when updating keyspace
Description:
To repro:
1. Open the cli
2. Create a keyspace:
create keyspace ks1 with placement_strategy = SimpleStrategy and strategy_options =
{replication_factor:1}
;
3. Update the keyspace:
update keyspace ks1 with strategy_options =
{replication_factor:3}
;
The output is:
[default@unknown] create keyspace ks1 with placement_strategy = SimpleStrategy and strategy_options =
{replication_factor:1}
;

[default@unknown]
The problem is that the patch in CASSANDRA-4052 assumes the CLI is authenticated to a working keyspace. getKSMetaData in executeUpdateKeySpace is called with keySpace, which is null.
Changing this to keyspaceName partially solves it, we now get:
[default@unknown] update keyspace ks1 with strategy_options =
{replication_factor:3}
;
Not authenticated to a working keyspace.

Not authenticated to a working keyspace.
This comes from replayAssumptions in getKSMetaData.
It seems that the refresh code needs to be reworked slightly to not assume the CLI is authenticated to a keyspace.
