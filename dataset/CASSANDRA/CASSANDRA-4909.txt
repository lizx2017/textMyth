Summary:
Bug when composite index is created in a table having collections
Description:
CASSANDRA-4511 is open to add proper indexing of collection, but currently indexing doesn't work correctly if we index a value in a table having collection, even if that value is not a collection itself.
We also don't refuse creating index on collections, even though we don't support it. Attaching patch to fix both.
