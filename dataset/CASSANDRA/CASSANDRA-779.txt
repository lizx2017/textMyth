Summary:
Bootstrapping is not threadsafe
Description:
The bootstrapper thread (called from the main thread which has acquired the lock for SS via SS.init) currently makes a few calls into SS that require its lock.
Those methods need to be thread-safe, but do not need the same lock required by SS.init.
