Summary:
Cqlsh cannot connect in trunk
Description:
Cqlsh errors with
Unable to connect to any servers', {'127.0.0.1': KeyError('column_aliases',)}
. To fix, we need to pull in a newer version of the python driver that doesn't assume certain metadata exists. This was broken by the cassandra commit cbbc1191ce1656a92354a4fa3859626cb10083e5. A fix should be in version 2.1.3 of the driver.
