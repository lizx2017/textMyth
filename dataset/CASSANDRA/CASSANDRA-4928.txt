Summary:
CQL3 SelectStatement should not share slice query filters amongst ReadCommand
Description:
In 1.2, SliceQueryFilter is stateful and should thus not be shared but SelectStatement is doing some sharing in the case of an IN query. This is the reason why cql_test:TestCQL.limit_multiget_test in the dtests is failing intermittently.
Let's be clear that the fact that SliceQueryFilter is stateful is ugly, but that is a concession made for performance until we can refactor all this more cleanly (which still being efficient). Such refactor being, as far as I can tell, far from trivial.
