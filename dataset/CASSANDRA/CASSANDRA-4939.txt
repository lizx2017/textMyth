Summary:
Add debug logging to list filenames processed by o.a.c.db.Directories.migrateFile method
Description:
Customer is getting the following error when starting Cassandra:
ERROR 20:20:06,635 Exception encountered during startup
java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException: String index out of range: -1
at java.lang.String.substring(Unknown Source)
at org.apache.cassandra.db.Directories.migrateFile(Directories.java:556)
at org.apache.cassandra.db.Directories.migrateSSTables(Directories.java:493)
It looks like this is caused by an file with an unexpected name in one of his keyspace directories. However, because we don't log the name of the file as it is processed, it is hard to tell which file is causing it to choke.
It would be good to add a logger.debug statement at the beginning of the method to list the file currently being processed.
