Summary:
Support bringing up a new datacenter to existing cluster without repair
Description:
Was talking to Brandon in irc, and we ran into a case where we want to bring up a new DC to an existing cluster. He suggested from jbellis the way to do it currently was set strategy options of dc2:0, then add the nodes. After the nodes are up, change the RF of dc2, and run repair.
I'd like to avoid a repair as it runs AES and is a bit more intense than how bootstrap works currently by just streaming ranges from the SSTables. Would it be possible to improve this functionality (adding a new DC to existing cluster) than the proposed method? We'd be happy to do a patch if we got some input on the best way to go about it.
