Summary:
Pig load/storefunc loads only one schema and BytesType validation class needs fix
Description:
With a recent optimization, it appears that the Pig load/store func gets only one schema from Cassandra and tries to apply it to all CFs in the pig script. Also, the BytesType validation tries to cast the object in putNext as a DataByteArray and wrap it as a ByteBuffer. Instead it should just call objToBB which should take care of it.
