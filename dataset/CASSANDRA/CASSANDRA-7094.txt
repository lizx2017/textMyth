Summary:
cqlsh: DESCRIBE is not case-insensitive
Description:
Keyspaces which are named starting with capital letters (and perhaps other things) sometimes require double quotes and sometimes do not.
For example, describe works without quotes:
cqlsh> describe keyspace ProductGenomeLocal;
CREATE KEYSPACE "ProductGenomeLocal" WITH replication = {
'class': 'SimpleStrategy',
'replication_factor': '3'
};
USE "ProductGenomeLocal";
[...]
But use will not:
cqlsh> use ProductGenomeLocal;
Bad Request: Keyspace 'productgenomelocal' does not exist
It seems that qoutes should only really be necessary when there's spaces or other symbols that need to be quoted.
At the least, the acceptance or failures of quotes should be consistent.
Other minor annoyance: tab expansion works in use and describe with quotes, but will not work in either without quotes.
