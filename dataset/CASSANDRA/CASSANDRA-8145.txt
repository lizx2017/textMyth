Summary:
Restore public access to QueryProcessor#processStatement
Description:
Classes which implement the QueryHandler interface were previously able to delegate to QueryProcessor#getStatement() and QueryProcessor#processStatement() which allowed them to inspect the parsed statement objects before execution. CASSANDRA-7719 made QueryProcessor#processStatement() private, so a custom QueryHandler is now forced to call QueryProcess#process and have the parsing performed twice.
