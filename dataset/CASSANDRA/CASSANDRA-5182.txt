Summary:
Deletable rows are sometimes not removed during compaction
Description:
Our use case is write heavy and read seldom. To optimize the space used, we've set the bloom_filter_fp_ratio=1.0 That along with the fact that each row is only written to one time and that there are more than 20 SSTables keeps the rows from ever being compacted. Here is the code:
https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/cassandra-1.1/src/java/org/apache/cassandra/db/compaction/CompactionController.java#L162
We hit this conner case and because of this C* keeps consuming more and more space on disk while it should not.
