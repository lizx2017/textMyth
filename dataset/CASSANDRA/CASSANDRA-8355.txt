Summary:
NPE when passing wrong argument in ALTER TABLE statement
Description:
When I tried to change the caching strategy of a table, I provided a wrong argument 'rows_per_partition' : ALL with unquoted ALL. Cassandra returned a SyntaxError, which is good, but it seems it was because of a NullPointerException.
Howto
CREATE TABLE foo (k int primary key);
ALTER TABLE foo WITH caching = {'keys' : 'all', 'rows_per_partition' : ALL};
Output
<ErrorMessage code=2000 [Syntax error in CQL query] message="Failed parsing statement: [ALTER TABLE foo WITH caching = {'keys' : 'all', 'rows_per_partition' : ALL};] reason: NullPointerException null">
