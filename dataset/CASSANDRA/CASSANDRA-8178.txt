Summary:
Column names are not converted correctly for non-text comparators
Description:
If a column family is created with a non-text comparator through Thrift (or cassandra-cli) and column metadata is defined, those column names cannot be queried through cql3.
For example:
[default@ks1] create column family entity_data
...   with column_type = 'Standard'
...   and comparator = 'BytesType'
...   and default_validation_class = 'BytesType'
...   and key_validation_class = 'UTF8Type'
...   and column_metadata = [
...     {column_name : '0008',
...     validation_class : UTF8Type,
...     index_name : 'entity_data_0008_idx',
...     index_type : 0}];
When you attempt to query that column through cqlsh, you'll get an error like this:
cqlsh:ks1> select "0008" FROM entity_data ;
Bad Request: Undefined name 0008 in selection clause
The problem is that we aren't taking the comparator type into account when converting column names in cql3 statements to their internal (ByteBuffer) representation.
