Summary:
Detect use of secondary indexes with TTL'd columns
Description:
We don't currently make any provisions for using TTL'd columns with secondary indexes. A reasonable temporary solution would be to fail inserts of TTL'd entries for indexed columns.
A longer term solution might be to record/detect the presence of expiring columns for an expression, and use that information to require post filtering in CFS.scan.
