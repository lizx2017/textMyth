Summary:
nodetool cleanup/scrub/upgradesstables promotes all sstables to next level (LeveledCompaction)
Description:
1.0.7 + LeveledCompactionStrategy
If you run nodetool cleanup, scrub, or upgradesstables, Cassandra execute compaction for each sstable. During the compaction, it put the new sstable to next level of the original sstable. If you run cleanup many times, sstables will reached to the highest level, and CASSANDRA-3608 will happens at next cleanup.
Reproduce procedure:
create column family CF1 with compaction_strategy=LeveledCompactionStrategy and compaction_strategy_options= {sstable_size_in_mb: 5}
;
Insert some data into CF1.
nodetool flush
Verify the sstable is created at L1 in CF1.json
nodetool cleanup
Verify sstable in L1 is removed and new sstable is created at L2 in CF1.json
repeat nodetool cleanup some times
