Summary:
Duplicate classes in Cassandra-all package.
Description:
As of Cassandra-All version 1.1.6 the classes org.apache.cassandra.thrift.ITransportFactory and org.apache.cassandra.thrift.TFramedTransportFactory are located in both the cassandra-thrift and the cassandra-all Maven JARS, and caasandra-thrift is imported by cassandra-all POM. This makes the cassandra-all package unbuildable when using the duplicate-finder Maven extension. The files were originally copied over due to CASSANDRA-4668. All versions since have failed to build when using this maven extension.
