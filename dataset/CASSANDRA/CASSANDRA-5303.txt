Summary:
Executing SELECT which uses IN() function, on table with set<> column , returns 'Internal application error'.
Description:
For the following table:
CREATE TABLE "Tweets"(
tweet_id uuid,
idx int, 
exampleset set<text>,
PRIMARY KEY(tweet_id,idx));
This query:
SELECT idx,tweet_id FROM "Tweets" WHERE idx IN (0, 1, 2) ALLOW FILTERING;
Returns:
'Internal application error'
Comment:
This error won't occur if insted of "IN (0, 1, 2)" we will use "IN (0)" (in select query).
Comment2:
This error won't occur if we will create table as above, but without set<> column.
