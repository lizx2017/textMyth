Summary:
Cli syntax for creating keyspace is inconsistent in 1.0
Description:
In 0.8, to create a keyspace you could do:
create keyspace test with placement_strategy = 'org.apache.cassandra.locator.SimpleStrategy' and strategy_options = [{replication_factor:3}]
In current trunk, if you try that, you get back "null". Turns out this is because the syntax for strategy_options has changed and you should not use the brackets, i.e:
strategy_options = {replication_factor:3}
(and note that reversely, this syntax doesn't work in 0.8).
I'm not sure what motivated that change but this is very user unfriendly. The help does correctly mention the new syntax, but it is the kind of changes that takes you 5 minutes to notice. It will also break people scripts for no good reason that I can see.
We should either:
revert to the old syntax
support both the new and old syntax
at least print a meaningful error message when the old syntax is used
Imho, the last solution is by far the worst solution.
