Issue Faced :
We have a Geo-red setup with 2 Data centers having 3 nodes each. When we bring down a single Cassandra node down in DC2 by kill -9 <Cassandra-pid>, reads fail on DC1 with TimedOutException for a brief amount of time (15-20 sec~).
Reference :
Already a ticket has been opened/resolved and link is provided below :

Activity Done as per Resolution Provided :
Upgraded to Cassandra 2.0.11 .
We have two 3 node clusters in two different DCs and if one or more of the nodes go down in one Data Center , ~5-10% traffic failure is observed on the other.
