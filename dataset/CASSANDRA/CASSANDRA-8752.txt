Summary:
invalid counter shard detected in Version 2.1.2
Description:
I was doing counter test (first +100 several times, then -33) on a 4 nodes cluster while below log appear at 2 nodes.There is no concurrent access to same counter.
WARN [CompactionExecutor:757] 2015-02-02 13:02:33,375 CounterContext.java:431 - invalid global counter shard detected; (9cca9262-934a-4275-963b-66802471b0c2, 1, -33) and (9cca9262-934a-4275-963b-66802471b0c2, 1, 100) differ only in count; will pick highest to self-heal on compaction
Anyone has encounter this problem? I thought Cassandra 2.1.2 had solved this counter problem, but it appeared.
