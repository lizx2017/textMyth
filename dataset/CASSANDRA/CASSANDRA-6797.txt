Summary:
compaction and scrub data directories race on startup
Description:
Hi,
On doing a rolling restarting of a 2.0.5 cluster in several environments I'm seeing the following error:

Seems like a potential race, since compactions are occurring whilst the existing data directories are being scrubbed.
Probably an in progress compaction looks like an incomplete one and results in it being attempted to be scrubbed whilst in progress.
On the attempt to delete in the scrubDataDirectories we discover that it no longer exists, presumably because it has now been compacted away.
This then causes an assertion error and the node fails to start up.
Here is a ccm script which just stops and starts a 3 node 2.0.5 cluster repeatedly.
It seems to fairly reliably reproduce the problem, in less than ten iterations:
#!/bin/bash

ccm create compaction_race -v 2.0.5
ccm populate -n 3
ccm start

for i in $(seq 0 1000); do 
    echo $i;
    ccm stop
    ccm start
    grep ERR ~/.ccm/compaction_race/*/logs/system.log;
done
Someone else should probably confirm that this is what is going wrong,
however if it is, the solution might be as simple as to disable autocompactions slightly earlier in CassandraDaemon.setup.
Or alternatively if there isn't a good reason why we are first scrubbing the system tables and then scrubbing all keyspaces (including the system keyspace), you could perhaps just scrub solely the non system keyspaces on the second scrub.
Please let me know if there is anything else I can provide.
Thanks,
Matt
