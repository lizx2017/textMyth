Summary:
Perform size-tiered compactions in L0 ("hybrid compaction")
Description:
If LCS gets behind, read performance deteriorates as we have to check bloom filters on man sstables in L0. For wide rows, this can mean having to seek for each one since the BF doesn't help us reject much.
Performing size-tiered compaction in L0 will mitigate this until we can catch up on merging it into higher levels.
