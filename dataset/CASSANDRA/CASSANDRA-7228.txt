Summary:
Closing CqlRecordReader doesn't release all resources
Description:
Closing CqlRecordReader doesn't release all resources - only session object is closed, cluster remains open. It may result in "too many open files" error, caused by still open cassandra connections (I had this error while working on my own InputFormat for cassandra - https://bitbucket.org/mrk/cassandra_hadoop_utils/). Attached patch fixes this issue for me.
