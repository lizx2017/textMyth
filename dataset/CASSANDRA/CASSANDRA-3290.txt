Summary:
Upgrade from 0.7.9 to 1.0, the java stress tool gives "error reading key" on data created in 0.7.9
Description:
TEST CASE
Install three node cluster with C* 0.7.9 with node1 as the seed
Run the 0.7.9 stress tool against node2,node3: ./stress -d node2,node3 -o insert
Run `nodetool -h node1 drain`
Upgrade binaries and edit cassandra.yaml for node1.
Startup C* 1.0 on node
Run the 0.7.9 stress tool against node2,node3: ./stress -d node2,node3 -o insert
ISSUE
Run the 0.7.9 stress tool to read data: ./stress -d node2 -o read
cathy3:~/apache-cassandra-0.7.9-src/contrib/stress/bin# ./stress -d cathy3 -o read
total,interval_op_rate,interval_key_rate,avg_latency,elapsed_time
Operation [17] retried 10 times - error reading key 0521977 

Operation [9] retried 10 times - error reading key 0595365 

Operation [15] retried 10 times - error reading key 0513247 
Additional notes
There are no errors in the log files
After upgrading the full ring, and running READ from both the old and new versions of stress tool, the error still exists
Once all nodes are upgraded, if I run INSERT followed by READ, the new reads are fine
