Summary:
Hadoop Compatibility Broken
Description:
Some enhancements we did recently for the CqlRecordReader are using the job context object directly to get the configuration. This patch fixes those issues so that we maintain compatibility with old and new mapreduce implementations.
Attached is a patch for the 2.0 branch.
