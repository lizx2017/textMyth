Summary:
Need to trim DC and RACK names in cassandra-topology.properties file
Description:
Some misprints in cassandra-topology.properties file can be painful for debugging. For example extra symbols at the end of line like a space. So difference between "DC1:RACK1" and "DC1:RACK1 " couldn't be detected using nodetool ring command.
I think that symbols like a space shouldn't be allowed in DC/RACK names. So I suggest to trim them.
The patch has been attached.
