Summary:
cassandra.bat does not use SETLOCAL, can cause classpath issues
Description:
In bin/cassandra.bat, we don't use SETLOCAL (although we do use ENDLOCAL for some reason), so modifications to the classpath within the batch script persist. This means that if you run cassandra-1.0.0/bin/cassandra.bat, kill the process, and then run cassandra-1.0.3/bin/cassandra.bat, the 1.0.0 jars will still be in the classpath.
