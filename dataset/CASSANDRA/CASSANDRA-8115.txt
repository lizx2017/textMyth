Summary:
Windows install scripts fail to set logdir and datadir
Description:
After CASSANDRA-7136, the install scripts to run Cassandra as a service fail on both the legacy and the powershell paths. Looks like they need to have
++JvmOptions=-Dcassandra.logdir=%CASSANDRA_HOME%\logs ^
++JvmOptions=-Dcassandra.storagedir=%CASSANDRA_HOME%\data
added to function correctly.
We should take this opportunity to make sure the source of the java options is uniform for both running and installation to prevent mismatches like this in the future.
