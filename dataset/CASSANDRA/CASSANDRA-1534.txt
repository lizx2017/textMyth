Summary:
errors reading while bootstrapping
Description:
I loaded a 4 node cluster with 1M rows from stress.py, decommissioned a node, and then began bootstrapping it while performing constant reads against the others with stress.py. After sleeping for 90s, the bootstrapping node started throwing many errors like this:
ERROR 16:51:48,667 Fatal exception in thread Thread[READ_STAGE:1270,5,main]
java.lang.RuntimeException: Cannot service reads while bootstrapping!
at org.apache.cassandra.db.ReadVerbHandler.doVerb(ReadVerbHandler.java:67)

And I began receiving timeout errors with stress.py.
