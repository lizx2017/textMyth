Summary:
tombstones gc'd before being locally applied
Description:
single node environment
CREATE KEYSPACE test WITH replication = {'class': 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor': 1 }
;
use test;
create table foo (a int, b int, primary key(a,b));
alter table foo with gc_grace_seconds = 0;
insert into foo (a,b) values (1,2);
select * from foo;
one row returned. so far, so good.
delete from foo where a=1 and b=2;
select * from foo;
0 rows. still rainbows and kittens.
bin/nodetool flush;
bin/nodetool compact;
select * from foo;
a | b
--+--
1 | 2
(1 rows)
gahhh.
looks like the tombstones were considered obsolete and thrown away before being applied to the compaction? gc_grace just means the interval after which they won't be available to remote nodes repair - they should still apply locally regardless (and do correctly in 2.0.9)
