Summary:
Word count example doesn't output the words correctly to cassandra. It outputs spurious data past the length of the byte array.
Description:
To reproduce:
start a local cassandra server e.g. sudo bin/cassandra -f
cd contrib/word_count
ant
bin/word_count_setup
bin/word_count
check the data in cassandra, all looks fine because the words are all of the same length.
change the data in cassandra to real words, rerun the mapreduce and you'll see some words have spurious characters written past their length
this is because the word bytes are not terminated at their length
