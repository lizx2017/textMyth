Summary:
Restore Commitlogs throws exception on startup on trunk
Description:
Running Cassandra from trunk, restoring commitlogs generated from trunk throws the following exception:
ERROR [main] 2014-11-11 13:47:14,738 CassandraDaemon.java:482 - Exception encountered during startup
java.lang.IllegalStateException: Unsupported commit log version: 5
        at org.apache.cassandra.db.commitlog.CommitLogArchiver.maybeRestoreArchive(CommitLogArchiver.java:215) ~[main/:na]
        at org.apache.cassandra.db.commitlog.CommitLog.recover(CommitLog.java:116) ~[main/:na]
        at org.apache.cassandra.service.CassandraDaemon.setup(CassandraDaemon.java:300) [main/:na]
        at org.apache.cassandra.service.CassandraDaemon.activate(CassandraDaemon.java:465) [main/:na]
        at org.apache.cassandra.service.CassandraDaemon.main(CassandraDaemon.java:557) [main/:na]
This is reproduced by the dtest snapshot_test.py:TestArchiveCommitlog.test_archive_commitlog. Attached are the system log of the node that threw the exception, and the commitlog files used. I am restoring the commitlog files by editing conf/commitlog_archiving.properties to look like this:
# Command to execute to make an archived commitlog live again.
# Parameters: %from is the full path to an archived commitlog segment (from restore_directories)
#             %to is the live commitlog directory
# Example: restore_command=cp -f %from %to
restore_command=cp -f %from %to

# Directory to scan the recovery files in.
restore_directories=/Users/philipthompson/cstar/archived/
. If the files are placed into the live commitlog directory manually, and then C* is started, there are no exceptions.
