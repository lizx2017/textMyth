Summary:
orphaned data files may be created during migration race
Description:
We try to prevent creating orphans by locking Table.flusherLock in maybeSwitchMemtable and the Migration process, but since the actual writing is done asynchronously in Memtable.writeSortedContents there is a race window, where we acquire lock in maybeSwitch, we're not dropped so we queue the flush and release the lock, Migration does the drop, then Memtable writes itself out.
