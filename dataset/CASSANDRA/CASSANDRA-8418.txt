Summary:
Queries that require allow filtering are working without it
Description:
The trunk dtest cql_tests.py:TestCQL.composite_index_with_pk_test has begun failing after the changes to CASSANDRA-7981.
With the schema
CREATE TABLE blogs (
                blog_id int,
                time1 int,
                time2 int,
                author text,
                content text,
                PRIMARY KEY (blog_id, time1, time2)
and
CREATE INDEX ON blogs(author)
, then the query
SELECT blog_id, content FROM blogs WHERE time1 > 0 AND author='foo'
now requires ALLOW FILTERING, but did not before the refactor.
