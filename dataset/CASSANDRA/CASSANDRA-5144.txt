Summary:
Validate login for Thrift describe_keyspace, describe_keyspaces and set_keyspace methods
Description:
Not validating login leaks info about keyspaces and columnfamilies if the configured authenticator requires validation.
This change does not affect AllowAllAuthenticator, but if an implementation forbids anonymous access, we should deny this information to unauthenticated users.
