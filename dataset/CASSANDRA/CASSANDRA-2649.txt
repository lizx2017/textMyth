Summary:
work-around schema disagreements from cqlsh
Description:
It is handy to be able to put CQL statements in a flat-file and load them by redirecting to cqlsh stdin, but this can fail on a cluster when executing statements that modify schema.
The attached patch works around this problem by retrying up to 3 times, with a progressive delay after each attempt. A better solution would probably be to compare schema versions, but this seems to work well enough, and is better than not handling it at all.
