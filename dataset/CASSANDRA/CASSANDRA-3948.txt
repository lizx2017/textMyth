Summary:
rename RandomAccessReader.MAX_BYTES_IN_PAGE_CACHE
Description:
This should make the fadvising useless (mostly). See CASSANDRA-1470 for why, including links to kernel source. I have not investigated the history of when this broke or whether it was like from the beginning.
For the record I have not confirmed this by testing, only by code inspection. I happened to notice it working on other things, so there is some chance that I'm just mis-reading the code.
