Summary:
separate assignment of current keyspace from login()
Description:
With the completion of CASSANDRA-714, it is now a requirement that login() be called, even when using the AllowAllAuthenticator (effectively disabling auth), since this is how the current/connected keyspace is set. These two disparate functions (assigning keyspace and authentication) should be disentangled.
I propose that the keyspace argument be removed from calls to login(), and that a new method (use_keyspace(string)?), be added.
