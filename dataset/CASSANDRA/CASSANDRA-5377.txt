Summary:
MemoryMeter miscalculating memtable live ratio
Description:
I've noticed the following logs in our running cluster:
WARN [MemoryMeter:1] 2013-03-17 23:15:55,876 Memtable.java (line 197) setting live ratio to minimum of 1.0 instead of 0.6378445488771007
It seems odd for the deep size calculation to be smaller than the aggregate sum of serialized columns. Perhaps it's because we're mutating on a bunch of existing columns, or perhaps there's some miscalculation somewhere
Our column families all have regular columns (no super columns, expiring columns, etc)
