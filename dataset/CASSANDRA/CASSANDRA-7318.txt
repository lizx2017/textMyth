Summary:
Unable to truncate column family on node which has been decommissioned and re-bootstrapped
Description:
After decommissioning a node, then re-bootstrapping it, it's not possible to truncate column families until cassandra is restarted.
Steps to reproduce:
Start with a two node deployment (nodes A and B)
Run nodetool decommission on node B
Stop cassandra on node B
Delete the contents of the cassandra data and commitlog directories
Start cassandra on node B with node A as the seed
Run cqlsh on node B and try to truncate a column family
cqlsh displays: "Unable to complete request: one or more nodes were unavailable."
According to the logs node B seems to think that itself is down. The follow logs appear when the server is started and there are no further logs to indicate the B is now UP (A=10.225.45.150, B=10.225.45.151):

INFO [RequestResponseStage:1] 2014-05-29 10:40:11,215 Gossiper.java (line 869) InetAddress /10.225.45.150 is now UP
This problem isn't hit if cassandra is restarted on node A while node B is stopped. The problem goes away if node B is restarted.
