Summary:
sstablerepairedset should take more that one sstable as an argument
Description:
Given that a c* node can have a number of sstables in the 10s (100s?) of thousands of sstables on it, sstablerepairedset should be taking a list of sstables to mark as repaired rather than a single sstable.
Running any command 10s of thousands of times isn't really good let alone one that spins up a jvm.
