Summary:
upgrading from 1.1.7 to 1.2.0 caused upgraded nodes to only know about other 1.2.0 nodes
Description:
I upgraded as I have since 0.86 and things didn't go very smoothly.
I did a nodetool drain to my 1.1.7 node and changed my puppet config to use the new merged config. When it came back up (without any errors in the log) a nodetool ring only showed itself. I upgraded another node and sure enough now nodetool ring showed two nodes.
I tried resetting the local schema. The upgraded node happily grabbed the schema again but still only 1.2 nodes were visible in the ring to any upgraded nodes.
