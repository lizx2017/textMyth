Summary:
Native protocol event don't respect the protocol version
Description:
Currently, the protocol version is on a per-message basis only. When we get a request, we respond with a message on the same protocol version. This is however broken for server events, that are responses to no request and currently always default to version 2 (on trunk), even if the client is on version 1.
So instead, we need to force a version per connection, and event messages should use that.
