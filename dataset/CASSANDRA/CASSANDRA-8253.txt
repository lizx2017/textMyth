Summary:
cassandra-stress 2.1 doesn't support LOCAL_ONE
Description:
Looks like a simple oversight in argument parsing:
âžœ bin ./cassandra-stress write cl=LOCAL_ONE
Invalid value LOCAL_ONE; must match pattern ONE|QUORUM|LOCAL_QUORUM|EACH_QUORUM|ALL|ANY
Also, CASSANDRA-7077 argues that it should be using LOCAL_ONE by default.
