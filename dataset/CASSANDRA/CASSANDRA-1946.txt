Summary:
cassandra-cli always uses port 8080 (show keyspaces brings up a WARNing), no matter which port is defined in cassandra-env.sh
Description:
In cassandra-cli I do a "show keyspaces;", this bring up this WARNing:
WARNING: Could not connect to the JMX on 10.1.1.106:8080, information won't be shown.
JMX (mx4j-tools) is up and running, but on port 18080 (defined in cassandra-env.sh), so the problem should be that the CLI uses 8080 statically?
