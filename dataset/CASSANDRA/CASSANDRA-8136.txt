Summary:
Windows Service never finishes shutting down
Description:
When using procrun and the -install combination on Windows and starting cassandra via services.msc, stopping the service never completes and gets stuck in "stopping" status forever. Probably related to:
    public void stop()
    {
        // this doesn't entirely shut down Cassandra, just the RPC server.
        // jsvc takes care of taking the rest down
        logger.info("Cassandra shutting down...");
        thriftServer.stop();
        nativeServer.stop();
    }
procrun calls the StopMethod as CassandraDaemon.stop so we may need to either a) augment what procrun's doing or b) add a more comprehensive stop to be called on Windows shutdown.
