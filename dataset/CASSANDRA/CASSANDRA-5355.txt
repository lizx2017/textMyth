Summary:
Collection values size is not validated.
Description:
Collections values are currently limited to 64K because the serialized form used uses shorts to encode the elements length (and for sets elements and key map, because they are part of the internal column name that is itself limited to 64K).
However, there is no check on the collection elements size currently so we don't refuse values > 64K (except for sets elements and map keys because we check internal column name sizes), even though they can't be decoded correctly client side.
