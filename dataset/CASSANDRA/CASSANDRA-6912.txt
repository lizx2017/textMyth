Summary:
SSTableReader.isReplaced does not allow for safe resource cleanup
Description:
There are a number of possible race conditions on resource cleanup from the use of cloneWithNewSummarySamplingLevel, because the replacement sstable can be itself replaced/obsoleted while the prior sstable is still referenced (this is actually quite easy with compaction, but can happen in other circumstances less commonly).
