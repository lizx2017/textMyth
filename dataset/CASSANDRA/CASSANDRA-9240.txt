Summary:
Performance issue after a restart
Description:
I have noticed a performance issue while I was working on compaction perf tests for CASSANDRA-7409. The performance for my use case is very bad after a restart. It is mostly a read performance issue but not strictly. I have attached my use case (see run_issue.sh and issue.yaml) and all test logs for 2.1.4, 2.1.5 and trunk:
2.1.* are OK (although 2.1.4 seems to be better than 2.1.5?): ~6-7k ops/second and ~2-2.5k of read latency.
trunk is NOT OK: ~1.5-2k ops/second and 25-30k of read latency.
trunk is OK without a restart: ~ same perf than 2.1.4 and 2.1.5.
EDIT: branch cassandra-2.1 is OK.
I can help to bisect and/or profile on Monday if needed.
