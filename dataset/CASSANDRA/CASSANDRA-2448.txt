Summary:
Remove loadbalance command
Description:
With the update to how the move command works, the loadbalance command is even less useful that it was previously. The loadbalance command now calculates the token it is going to move to before it leaves which means it isn't considering the load it is giving away. Given that, I think we should just remove the loadbalance command entirely. Anyone who wants to do an old style loadbalance can just do decommission then bootstrap.
This is a minor change, and honestly I think it might count as a 'bug' so I think we should squeeze it into 0.8, post-freeze.
