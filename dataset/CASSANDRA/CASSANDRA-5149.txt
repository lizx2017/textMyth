Summary:
Respect slice count even if column expire mid-request
Description:
This is a follow-up of CASSANDRA-5099.
If a column expire just while a slice query is performed, it is possible for replicas to count said column as live but to have the coordinator seeing it as dead when building the final result. The effect that the query might return strictly less columns that the requested slice count even though there is some live columns matching the slice predicate but not returned in the result.
