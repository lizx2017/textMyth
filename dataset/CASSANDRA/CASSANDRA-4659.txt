Summary:
Fix consistency ALL parsing in CQL3
Description:
CASSANDRA-4490 made some change to the parsing of ALL for consistency levels (introducing a specific token K_ALL). It's unclear why since that new token is not used (that is, except for the consistency level), probably some left over of a previous version of the patch.
In any case, this doesn't work. K_ALL and K_LEVEL being both tokens, the string 'ALL' will always generate K_ALL and never K_LEVEL and thus 'USING CONSISTENCY ALL' doesn't parse anymore.
