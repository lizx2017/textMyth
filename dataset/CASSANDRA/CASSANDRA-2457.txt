Summary:
Batch_mutate is broken for counters
Description:
CASSANDRA-2384 allowed for batch_mutate to take counter and non counter operation, but the code was not updated correctly to handle that case. As it is, the code will use the first mutation in the batch list to decide whether to apply the write code path of counter or not, and will thus break if those are mixed.
