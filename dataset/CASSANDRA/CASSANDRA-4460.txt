Summary:
SystemTable.setBootstrapState always sets bootstrap state to true
Description:
public static void setBootstrapState(BootstrapState state)
{ String req = "INSERT INTO system.%s (key, bootstrapped) VALUES ('%s', '%b')"; processInternal(String.format(req, LOCAL_CF, LOCAL_KEY, getBootstrapState())); forceBlockingFlush(LOCAL_CF); }
Third parameter %b is set from getBootstrapState() which returns an enum, thus %b collapses to null/non null checks. This would seem then to always set it to true.
