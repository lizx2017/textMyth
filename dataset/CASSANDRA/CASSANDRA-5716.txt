Summary:
Remark on cassandra-5273 : Hanging system after OutOfMemory. Server cannot die due to uncaughtException handling
Description:
Possible incorrect handling of an OOM as a result of modifications made for issue cassandra-5273.
I could reproduce the OOM, with the patch of Cassandra-5273 applied.
The good news is that, at least in my case, it works fine : the system did die !
However, due to multiple uncaughtException handling, multiple threads are calling the exitThread.start() routine, causing an IllegalStateException. There are some other exceptions also, but that seems logical. Also, after calling the start() function, the thread(s) will continue to run, and that could not be wanted.
Below I pasted the stack trace.
Just for your information, after all this works, and I could restart the Cassandra server and redo the OOM
