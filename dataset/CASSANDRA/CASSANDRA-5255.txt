Summary:
dsnitch severity is not correctly set for compaction info
Description:
We're doing two things wrong in CI. First, load can change between calls, which can cause a negative severity even though it meant to subtract whatever it added before. Second, we should report based on how much IO we're using, since a 1T throttled to 5MB/s is less impactful than a 100MB running at full speed.
