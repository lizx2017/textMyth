Summary:
compaction_strategy_class ignored during table creation in 1.2.8
Description:
Creating a table with LeveledCompactionStrategy in 1.2.8 seems to ignore it's compaction_strategy_class.
CREATE KEYSPACE activities WITH strategy_class = 'SimpleStrategy'
AND strategy_options:replication_factor = '1';
USE activities;
CREATE TABLE activity (
KEY blob PRIMARY KEY
)
WITH compaction_strategy_class='LeveledCompactionStrategy';
echo 'DESCRIBE KEYSPACE activities;' | cqlsh
Shows:
compaction_strategy_class='SizeTieredCompactionStrategy'
If you update it with
ALTER TABLE activity with compaction_strategy_class='LeveledCompactionStrategy' ;
Then the describe will now return correct results.
