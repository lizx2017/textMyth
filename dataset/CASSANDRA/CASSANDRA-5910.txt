Summary:
Most CQL3 functions should handle null gracefully
Description:
Currently, we don't allow null parameters for functions. So
UPDATE test SET d=dateOf(null) WHERE k=0
is basically an invalid query. Unfortunately, there's at least one case where we don't validate correctly, namely if we do:
SELECT k, dateOf(t) FROM test
In that case, if for any of the row t is null, we end up with a server side NPE. But more importantly, throwing an InvalidException in that case would be pretty inconvenient and actually somewhat wrong since the query is not invalid in itself. So, at least in that latter case, we want dateOf(t) == null when t == null. And if we do that, I suggest making it always the case (i.e. make the first query valid but assigning null to d).
