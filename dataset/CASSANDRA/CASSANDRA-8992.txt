Summary:
CommitLogTest hangs intermittently
Description:
CommitLogTest hangs about 20% of the time in trunk. I haven't seen this happen in 2.1, yet, but will have to loop over it to be sure.
21:26:15     [junit] Testsuite: org.apache.cassandra.db.CommitLogTest
21:46:15 Build timed out (after 20 minutes). Marking the build as aborted.
I was able to repro locally, looping over the test and have attached the system.log from that repro.
