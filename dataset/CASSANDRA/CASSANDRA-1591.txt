Summary:
get_range_slices always returns super columns that's been removed/restored, regardless of count value in slicerange
Description:
I'm seeing cases where the count in slicerange predicate is not respected. This is only happening for super columns. I'm running Cassandra 0.6.4 in a single node.
Steps to reproduce, using the Keyspace1.Super1 CF:
insert three super columns, bar1 bar 2, and bar3, under the same key
delete bar1
insert bar1 again
run a get_range_slices on Super1, with start=bar1, finish=bar3, and count=1
I expected only bar1 to be returned, but both both bar1 and bar2 are returned. bar3 isn't, though. so count is somewhat respected.
perl code to reproduce is attached
when I tried the same test on a standard CF it worked. only super CF seem to have this problem.
