Summary:
"Index manager cannot support deleting and inserting into a row in the same mutation"
Description:
I use hector 0.8.0-1 and cassandra 0.8.
1. create mutator by using hector api,
2. Insert a few columns into the mutator for key "key1", cf "standard".
3. add a deletion to the mutator to delete the record of "key1", cf "standard".
4. repeat 2 and 3
5. execute the mutator.
the result: the connection seems to be held by the sever forever, it never returns. when I tried to restart the cassandra I saw unsupportedexception : "Index manager cannot support deleting and inserting into a row in the same mutation". and the cassandra is dead forever, unless I delete the commitlog.
I would expect to get an exception when I execute the mutator, not after I restart the cassandra.
