Summary:
in cassandra-cli, the help command output on validation types should be updated
Description:
from cassandra-cli, say type "help assume"
you will find:
Supported values are:
AsciiType
BytesType
CounterColumnType (distributed counter column)
IntegerType (a generic variable-length integer type)
LexicalUUIDType
LongType
UTF8Type
ok now:
[default@cfs] assume inode comparator as UTF8Type;
Type 'UTF8Type' was not found. Available: bytes, integer, long, lexicaluuid, timeuuid, utf8, ascii.
so looks like the "supported type list should be update by taking away the "Type" post-fix..
however, on the other hand, you can't really use it:
[default@cfs] update column family inode;
Unable to find abstract-type class 'org.apache.cassandra.db.marshal.utf8'
looks like from the update, you still need the "Type" (case insensitive?)
