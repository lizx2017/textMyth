Summary:
INSERT query adds new value to collection type
Description:
Hello,
I don't know if somebody has reported this regression in v2.0.1: INSERT query adds new value to collection type (eg. List) instead of replacing it.
CQL3 docs:
http://cassandra.apache.org/doc/cql3/CQL.html#collections
Note: An INSERT will always replace the entire list.
We do not encounter this issue with v1.2.9.
Could you please have a look at the issue?
Thanks for your help.
Best regards,
Minh
