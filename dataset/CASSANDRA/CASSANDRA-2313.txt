Summary:
CommutativeRowIndexer always read full row in memory
Description:
CommutativeRowIndexer use CFSerializer.deserializeColumns() that read the full row in memory. We should use PreCompactedRow/LazilyCompactedRow instead to avoid this on huge row.
As an added benefit, using PreCompactedRow will avoid a current seek back to write the row size.
