Summary:
Support SQL data types in CQL
Description:
We should support SQL data types where possible:
(sql -> cassandra)
varint -> int
bigint -> long
varchar, text -> utf8
ascii -> ascii (not strictly correct – sql defines collations for this – but close enough for a 1.0)
uuid -> uuid (see CASSANDRA-2233)
bytea -> bytes
IMO the right thing to do is only support the SQL types in CQL CREATE statements, because there is ambiguity otherwise (in particular with "int").
