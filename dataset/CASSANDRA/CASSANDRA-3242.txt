Summary:
Nodes which are not in the ring but are dead in gossip prevent truncation
Description:
All of the nodes in my ring are up, however I do have an 'unreachable' node in gossip which was removed some time ago. When I attempt to run a truncation, it does not execute since some nodes are dead, despite those nodes not owning anything in the ring.
Could isAnyHostDown in StorageProxy.java be modified to not care about unreachable nodes that are not in the ring?
