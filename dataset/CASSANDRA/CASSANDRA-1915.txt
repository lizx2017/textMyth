Summary:
stress.java doesn't actually read its data
Description:
stress.java doesn't actually read back the keys it inserts, but also reports no errors. This is evident on larger (1M) runs where the read request rate is equal to what the bloom filter can do. Stress.py also cannot find the rows that stress.java inserts.
