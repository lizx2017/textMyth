Summary:
DROP INDEX ks.index_name is a syntax error in 2.0
Description:
In all versions of 2.0, statements like
DROP INDEX ks.index_to_drop;
fail with the error
ErrorMessage code=2000 [Syntax error in CQL query] message="line 1:13 missing EOF at '.'"
The error doesn't happen in any 2.1 versions or trunk. The docs don't indicate that the DROP INDEX statement should work any differently on 2.0.
Here is a dtest that produces the error, but I think a patch should include a more isolated test for the component that's failing here.
