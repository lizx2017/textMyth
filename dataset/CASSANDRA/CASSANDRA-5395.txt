Summary:
Compaction doesn't remove index entries as designed
Description:
PerColumnIndexUpdater ignores updates where the new value is a tombstone. It should still remove the index entry on oldColumn.
(Note that this will not affect user-visible correctness, since KeysSearcher/CompositeSearcher will issue deletes against stale index entries, but having more stale entries than we "should" could affect performance.)
