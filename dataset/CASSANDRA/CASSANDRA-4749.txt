Summary:
Possible problem with widerow in Pig URI
Description:
I don't have a good way to test this directly, but I'm concerned the Uri parsing for widerows isn't going to work. setLocation
1.) calls setLocationFromUri (which sets widerows to the Uri value)
2.) sets widerows to a static value (which is defined as false)
3.) sets widerows to the system setting if it exists.
That doesn't seem right...
But setLocationFromUri also gets called from setStoreLocation, and I don't really know the difference between setLocation and setStoreLocation in terms of what is going on in terms of the integration between cassandra/pig/hadoop.
