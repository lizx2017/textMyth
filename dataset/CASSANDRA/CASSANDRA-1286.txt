Summary:
Nodetool ring crashes when no schema is loaded
Description:
Nodetool ring uses SP.getRangeToEndpointMap(null) that tries to retrieve the first non system keyspace.
Hences it crashes (with a IndexOutOfBoundsException) if no schema is loaded.
Should we return a nice little error message or make it work even no schema is loaded ?
