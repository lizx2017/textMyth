Summary:
AssertionError in ColumnFamilyStore.getOverlappingSSTables() during repair
Description:
We have hit the following exception on several nodes while running repairs across our 1.1.2 ring. We've observed it happen on either the node executing the repair or a participating replica in the repair operation. The result in either case is that the repair hangs.

In building this ring we migrated sstables from an identical 0.8.8 ring by:
1. Creating the schema on our new 1.1.2 ring.
2. Rsyncing over sstables from 0.8.8 ring.
3. Renaming the sstables to match the directory and file naming structure of 1.1.x.
4. Ran nodetool refresh <keyspace> <cf> for each CF across each node.
5. Ran nodetool upgradesstables for each CF across each node.
When those steps had completed, we began rolling repairs. Not all of the repair operations have hit the exception â€“ some of the repairs have completed successfully.
