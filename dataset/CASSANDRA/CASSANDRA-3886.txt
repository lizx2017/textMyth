Summary:
Pig can't store some types after loading them
Description:
In CASSANDRA-2810, we removed the decompose methods in putNext instead relying on objToBB, however it cannot sufficiently handle all types. For instance, if longs are loaded and then an attempt to store them is made, this causes a cast exception: java.io.IOException: java.io.IOException: java.lang.ClassCastException: java.lang.Long cannot be cast to org.apache.pig.data.DataByteArray Output must be (key,
{(column,value)...}) for ColumnFamily or (key, {supercolumn:{(column,value)...}
...}) for SuperColumnFamily
