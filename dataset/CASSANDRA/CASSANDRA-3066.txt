Summary:
Creating a keyspace SYSTEM cause issue
Description:
It's possible to create a keyspace SYSTEM but impossible to do anything with it after.
I know naming a keyspace SYSTEM is probably not a good idea but I was testing something on a test cluster and found this bug. Step to reproduce:
connect localhost/9160;
create keyspace SYSTEM;
use SYSTEM;
create column family test
with comparator = UTF8Type and subcomparator = UTF8Type
and default_validation_class = UTF8Type
and column_metadata = [
{column_name: title, validation_class: UTF8Type}
,
{column_name: publisher, validation_class: UTF8Type}
];
And you get:
system keyspace is not user-modifiable
Although SYSTEM keyspace have been created and is a different keyspace as system.
