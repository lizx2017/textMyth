Summary:
Fix online help in cqlsh for COPY commands
Description:
the HELP COPY output from cqlsh says:
COPY [cqlsh only]

  Imports CSV data into a Cassandra table.

COPY <table_name> [ ( column [, ...] ) ]
     FROM ( '<filename>' | STDIN )
     [ WITH <option>='value' [AND ...] ];
COPY <table_name> [ ( column [, ...] ) ]
     TO ( '<filename>' | STDOUT )
     [ WITH <option>='value' [AND ...] ];
It's confusing cause COPY is now for both export and import, since CASSANDRA-4434.
