Summary:
cql cassandra version reporting is incorrect
Description:
It looks like either the docs are wrong or the functionality is wrong. The docs for show version say:
Shows the version and build of the connected Cassandra instance, well as the versions of the CQL spec and the Thrift protocol that the connected Cassandra instance understands.
On a cassandra node in the ring, I do nodetool -h localhost version and it outputs the correct version (1.0.8). From a remote node with 1.0.9 installed, I run nodetool -h <same_node_in_ring> version. It outputs the correct version. However when I start cqlsh, it shows the remote node's version (1.0.9). Also when I use the 'show version;' command in cqlsh, it also prints out 1.0.9.
So either the docs are incorrect and it just outputs the version of the local build or there's a bug in show version and the startup output and it should really show the version of the connected node.
