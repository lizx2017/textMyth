Summary:
bad classapth for 'sstablerepairedset' in 'cassandra-tools' package
Description:
The script 'sstablerepairedset' is not ready out of the box for debian distro, maybe due to the refactoring of CASSANDRA-7160 to pack out tools from the bin directory.
Actually in 'sstablerepairedset' the classapth is calculated with:
if [ "x$CLASSPATH" = "x" ]; then
    
    # execute from the build dir.
    if [ -d `dirname $0`/../../build/classes ]; then
        for directory in `dirname $0`/../../build/classes/*; do
            CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:$directory
        done
    else
        if [ -f `dirname $0`/../lib/stress.jar ]; then
            CLASSPATH=`dirname $0`/../lib/stress.jar
        fi
    fi

    for jar in `dirname $0`/../../lib/*.jar; do
        CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:$jar
    done
fi
Whereas in other scripts from the 'bin/tools', the classpath is calculated with:
if [ "x$CASSANDRA_INCLUDE" = "x" ]; then
    for include in "`dirname "$0"`/cassandra.in.sh" \
                   "$HOME/.cassandra.in.sh" \
                   /usr/share/cassandra/cassandra.in.sh \
                   /usr/local/share/cassandra/cassandra.in.sh \
                   /opt/cassandra/cassandra.in.sh; do
        if [ -r "$include" ]; then
            . "$include"
            break
        fi
    done
elif [ -r "$CASSANDRA_INCLUDE" ]; then
    . "$CASSANDRA_INCLUDE"
fi
I think that a little refactoring could be good to extract the common part of these scripts like the computation of the CLASSPATH and the set of JAVA_HOME.
