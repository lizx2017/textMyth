Summary:
Removing a seed causes previously removed seeds to reappear
Description:
When you remove a seed from a cluster, Gossiper.removeEndpoint ensures it is removed from the seed list. However, it also resets the seed list to be the original list, which would bring back any previously removed seeds. What is the reasoning for having the call to buildSeedsList()? If it wasnâ€™t there then I think the problem would be solved.
