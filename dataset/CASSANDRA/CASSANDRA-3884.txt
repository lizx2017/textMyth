Summary:
Intermittent SchemaDisagreementException
Description:
Set up a cluster of two nodes (on cassandra-1.1), create some keyspaces and column families, and then make several schema changes. Everything is being done through only one of the nodes. About once every 10 times (on my setup) I get a SchemaDisagreementException when creating and dropping keyspaces.
There is a dtest for this: schema_changes_test.py. If your environment behaves like mine, you might need to run it 10 times to get the error.
