Summary:
Schema disagreements when using connections to multiple hosts
Description:
If you have two thrift connections open to different nodes and you create a KS using the first, then a CF in that KS using the second, you wind up with a schema disagreement even if you wait/sleep after creating the KS.
The attached script reproduces the issue using pycassa (1.0.6 should work fine, although it has the 0.7 thrift-gen code). It's also reproducible by hand with two cassandra-cli sessions.
