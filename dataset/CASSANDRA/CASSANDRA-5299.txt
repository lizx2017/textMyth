Summary:
isLocalDc() in OutboundTcpConnection class retrieves local IP in wrong way
Description:
My question from dev mailing list:
Can someone explain me why isLocalDc() in OutboundTcpConnection class uses DatabaseDescriptor.getRpcAddress() for retrieving "local" IP, instead of using DD.getListenAddress() or - even better - FBUtilities.getLocalAddress()? I mean - I don't get why RPC address is checked before initializing internode (so not RPC-based) communication, which will use IP address returned by (in OTCPool) FBUtilities.getLocalAddress()?
And response by Marcus Eriksson:
That should probably be FBUtilities.getBroadCastAddress even, could you file a ticket?
