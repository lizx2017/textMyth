Summary:
making cassandra-cli friendlier to scripts
Description:
It is currently possible (and useful) to execute bulk commands with cassandra-cli using shell redirection. However, there is no mechanism for handling errors, and the same output seen in an interactive session is echoed to the terminal.
The patch that follows accepts a new argument, (--batch), which:
disables initialization of the history file
suppresses output (stdout only)
exits on error with status 2 for invalid syntax, 4 for invalid requests, and 8 for everything else.
