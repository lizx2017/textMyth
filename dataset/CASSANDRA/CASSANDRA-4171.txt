Summary:
cql3 ALTER TABLE foo WITH default_validation=int has no effect
Description:
running the following with cql3:
CREATE TABLE test (foo text PRIMARY KEY) WITH default_validation=timestamp;
ALTER TABLE test WITH default_validation=int;
does not actually change the default validation type of the CF. It does under cql2.
No error is thrown. Some properties can be successfully changed using ALTER WITH, such as comment and gc_grace_seconds, but I haven't tested all of them. It seems probable that default_validation is the only problematic one, since it's the only (changeable) property which accepts CQL typenames.
