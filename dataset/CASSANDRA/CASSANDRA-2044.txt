Summary:
CLI should loop on describe_schema until agreement or fatel exit with stacktrace/message if no agreement after X seconds
Description:
see CASSANDRA-2026 for brief background.
It's easy to enter statements into the CLI before the schema has settled, often causing problems where it is no longer possible to get the nodes in agreement about the schema without removing the system directory.
The alleviate the most common problems with this, the CLI should issue the modification statement and loop on describe_schema until all nodes agree or until X seconds has passed. If the timeout has been exceeded, the CLI should exit with an error and inform the user that the schema has not settled and further migrations are ill-advised until it does.
number_of_nodes/2+1 seconds seems like a decent wait time for schema migrations to start with.
Bonus points for making the value configurable.
