Summary:
Insert/Get Contention
Description:
We tried out the socket io patch in CASSANDRA-705, tested the latest JVM of b18 for 1.6. Still seeing very strange insert times. We see this with get_slices as well but it's easy to reproduce with batch_insert. I wonder if its related to Memtable contention, it's pretty easy to see the slow times when you restart the test script attached. We are running this on a 7 node cluster, <1% cpu. Consistency Level of 1.
