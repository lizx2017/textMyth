Summary:
system.schema_columns sometimes missing for 'system' keyspace
Description:
Occasionally a Cassandra node will have missing schema_columns information where keyspace_name='system'.
cqlsh> select * from system.schema_columns where keyspace_name='system';

 keyspace_name | columnfamily_name | column_name
---------------+-------------------+-------------

(0 rows)
All keyspace and column family schema info is present for 'system' â€“ it's only the column information missing.
This can occur on an existing cluster following node restart. The data usually appears again after bouncing the node.
This is impactful to client drivers that expect column meta for configured tables.
Reproducible in 2.1.2. Have not seen it crop up in 2.0.11.
