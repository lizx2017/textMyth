Summary:
user created with debian packaging is unable to increase memlock
Description:
To reproduce:
Install a fresh copy of ubuntu 10.04.
Install sun's java6 jdk.
Install libjna-java 3.2.7 into /usr/share/java.
Install cassandra 0.7.0 from the apache debian packages.
Start cassandra using /etc/init.d/cassandra
In the output.log there will be the following error:
Unable to lock JVM memory (ENOMEM). This can result in part of the JVM being swapped out, especially with mmapped I/O enabled. Increase RLIMIT_MEMLOCK or run Cassandra as root.
This shouldn't be as the debian package creates /etc/security/limits.d/cassandra.conf and sets the cassandra user's memlock limit to 'unlimited'.
I tried a variety of things including making the memlock unlimited for all users in /etc/security/limits.conf. I was able to run cassandra using root with jna symbolically linked into /usr/share/cassandra from /usr/share/java, but I could never get the init.d script to work and get beyond that error.
Based on all the trial and error, I think it might have to do with the cassandra user itself, but my debian/ubuntu fu isn't as good as others'.
