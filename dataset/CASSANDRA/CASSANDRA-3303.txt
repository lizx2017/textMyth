Summary:
Short reads protection results in returning more columns than asked for
Description:
When we detect a short read (in SP.fetchRows), we retry a new command created by:
logger.debug("detected short read: expected {} columns, but only resolved {} columns", sliceCommand.count, liveColumnsInRow);
int retryCount = sliceCommand.count + sliceCommand.count - liveColumnsInRow;
SliceFromReadCommand retryCommand = new SliceFromReadCommand(command.table,
                                                             command.key,
                                                             command.queryPath,
                                                             sliceCommand.start,
                                                             sliceCommand.finish,
                                                             sliceCommand.reversed,
                                                             retryCount);
That is, in that new command, the count is greater than what asked in the initial command. But we never cut back the result of that new retried query.
