Summary:
Avoid digest mismatch storm on upgrade to 3.0
Description:
CASSANDRA-8099, in UnfilteredRowIterators.digest():
        // TODO: we're not computing digest the same way that old nodes. This
        // means we'll have digest mismatches during upgrade. We should pass the messaging version of
        // the node this is for (which might mean computing the digest last, and won't work
        // for schema (where we announce the version through gossip to everyone))
In a mixed 2.1(2.2) - 3.0 clusters, we need to calculate both digest at the same time and keep both results, and send the appropriate one, depending on receiving nodes' messaging versions. Do that until MessagingService.allNodesAtLeast30() is true (this is not unprecedented).
