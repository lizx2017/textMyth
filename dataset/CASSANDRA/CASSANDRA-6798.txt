Summary:
fix artifacts task to strip out DOS crlf
Description:
DOS builds end up with ^M in the unix shell scripts. updated the build to strip them so that builds on windows will run fine on linux. My github fork is https://github.com/woolfel/cassandra
I can't figure out how to make a patch with github, so I'm lame. The fix is checked in.
