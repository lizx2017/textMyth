Summary:
renaming a keyspace, then trying to use original name again makes errorations
Description:
My test case does the following:
Create a keyspace with at least one CF in it.
Rename that keyspace
Create a new keyspace with the same original name, containing a CF with the same name as earlier.
The second keyspace creation receives an error (although the keyspace does get created):
javax.management.InstanceAlreadyExistsException: org.apache.cassandra.db:type=ColumnFamilies,keyspace=keyspacename,columnfamily=cfname
After that point, trying to do almost anything with the new keyspace will generate the same error- even trying to drop it. This persists until cassandra itself is restarted.
One supposes that some JMX thing is lacking reregistration upon keyspace rename.
