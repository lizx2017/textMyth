Summary:
OOM while loading key cache at startup
Description:
Steps to be able to reproduce it :
have a heap of 1Gb
have a saved key cache without the SSTables
When looking at KeyCacheSerializer.serialize : it always writes a Boolean
When looking at KeyCacheSerializer.deserialize : no Boolean is read if SSTable is missing...
In case of a promoted index, RowIndexEntry.serializer.skip(...) should be called rather than RowIndexEntry.serializer.skipPromotedIndex(...) (again for symmetry between serialization/deserialization)
Attached is a proposed patch
