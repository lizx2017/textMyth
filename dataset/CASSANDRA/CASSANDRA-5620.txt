Summary:
Incorrect Syntax for Timestamp in Select query
Description:
In the page http://cassandra.apache.org/doc/cql3/CQL.html under the heading Queries --> SELECT --> <where-clause> We have a table posts followed by a Query which doesnt seem to work against the Cassandra Server.
Timestamp requires quotes in the WHERE clause.
CREATE TABLE posts (
userid text,
blog_title text,
posted_at timestamp,
entry_title text,
content text,
category int,
PRIMARY KEY (userid, blog_title, posted_at)
)
Incorrect
SELECT entry_title, content FROM posts WHERE userid='john doe' AND blog_title='John's Blog' AND posted_at >= 2012-01-01 AND posted_at < 2012-01-31
I get the the error mismatched character '<EOF>' expecting '''
If I correc the error in Johns''Blog and proceed I get missing EOF at '-01'
Correct
SELECT entry_title, content FROM posts WHERE userid='john doe' AND blog_title='John''s Blog' AND posted_at >= '2012-01-01' AND posted_at < '2012-01-31'
