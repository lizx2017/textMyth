Summary:
CQL help in trunk/doc/cql3/CQL.textile outdated
Description:
https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/trunk/doc/cql3/CQL.textile doesn't include the new create keyspace syntax or the collections. Last time, I updated the CQL.textile for Paul Cannon to review. Want me to do it again?
BNR-like formatting needs to be replaced, right?, because the brackets now have literal meaning. I test-applied this custom formatting to commands and it seems ok: Uppercase means literal (lowercase nonliteral), italics mean optional, the | symbol means OR, ... means repeatable. The ... in italics doesn't strictly explain things like nested [...] does, but it's easier on the eyes and loosely understandable. Any doubt could be erased by examples, I think.
