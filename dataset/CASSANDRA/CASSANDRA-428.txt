Summary:
source for (unreleased )commons javaflow jar
Description:
Commons javaflow has never had a release, so our 1.0-SNAPSHOT jar is considered bad practice by some, (see: http://www.mail-archive.com/general@incubator.apache.org/msg22471.html).
This issue has been raised twice during cassandra release votes.
