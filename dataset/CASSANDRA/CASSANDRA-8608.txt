Summary:
Fix cassandra-stress bug introduced by 7964, and cleanup related code a little
Description:
7964 had a very basic mistake present when wiring up writes - the "limit" was not reset, so only the first row would be returned (the fact ANY row was returned was itself sort-of a bug in this scenario, and I've changed this also). At the same time I've changed the definition of limit to lastRow so that the related functionality is clearer and more obviously correct.
