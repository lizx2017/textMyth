Summary:
LOCAL_ONE code in the native protocol is not the same in C* 1.2 and C* 2.0
Description:
When LOCAL_ONE was added (CASSANDRA-6202), it was unfortunately not given the same code (the one used by the native protocol) in C* 1.2 and C* 2.0. In 1.2 it's 8 (even though the specification document pretends it's 10) while it's 10 in 2.0.
This basically breaks backward compatibility for the v1 protocol between C* 1.2 and C* 2.0. Now, we could "fix" 2.0 adding special cases for the v1 protocol but that's going to be a bit of a pain, so instead I suggest to just switch to 10 in 1.2. Since the spec was wrong anyway and nobody complained so far this suggest no-one has really added support for LOCAL_ONE in the native protocol against 1.2.11, so if we change it now we can just say to people to upgrade to 1.2.12 directly if they want to use LOCAL_ONE with the native protocol. Attaching simple patch for that.
