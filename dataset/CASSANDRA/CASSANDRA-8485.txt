Summary:
Move 2.0 metered flusher to its own thread
Description:
We are using SS.optionalTasks for the MF right now - something we most definitely should not be doing, given just how important running MF regularly is to the stability of a node. Currently a bunch of other tasks are also using SS.optionalTasks (like serializing caches).
