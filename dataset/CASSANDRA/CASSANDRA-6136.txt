Summary:
CQL should not allow an empty string as column identifier
Description:
CQL currently allows users to create a table with an empty string as column identifier:
CREATE TABLE t (k int primary key, "" int);
Which results in the following table:
CREATE TABLE t (
  k int,
  "" int,
  PRIMARY KEY (k)
) WITH
  bloom_filter_fp_chance=0.010000 AND
  caching='KEYS_ONLY' AND
  comment='' AND
  dclocal_read_repair_chance=0.000000 AND
  gc_grace_seconds=864000 AND
  index_interval=128 AND
  read_repair_chance=0.100000 AND
  replicate_on_write='true' AND
  populate_io_cache_on_flush='false' AND
  default_time_to_live=0 AND
  speculative_retry='NONE' AND
  memtable_flush_period_in_ms=0 AND
  compaction={'class': 'SizeTieredCompactionStrategy'} AND
  compression={'sstable_compression': 'SnappyCompressor'};
Empty strings are not allowed for keyspace and table identifiers though.
I guess it's just a case that we haven't covered. Of course making it illegal in a future version would be a breaking change, but nobody serious would manually have chosen such an identifier...
