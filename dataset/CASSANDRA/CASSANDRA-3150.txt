Summary:
ColumnFormatRecordReader loops forever (StorageService.getSplits(..) out of whack)
Description:
From http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.db.cassandra.user/20039
Cassandra-0.8.4 w/ ByteOrderedPartitioner
CFIF's inputSplitSize=196608
3 map tasks (from 4013) is still running after read 25 million rows.
Can this be a bug in StorageService.getSplits(..) ?
getSplits looks pretty foolproof to me but I guess we'd need to add
more debug logging to rule out a bug there for sure.
I guess the main alternative would be a bug in the recordreader paging.
