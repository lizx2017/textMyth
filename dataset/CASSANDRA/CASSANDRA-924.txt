Summary:
incorrect neighbor calculation in repair
Description:
With Replicationfactor=2, if a server is brought down and its data directory wiped out, it doesn't restore its data replica after restart and nodeprobe repair.
Steps to reproduce:
1) Bring up a cluster with three servers cs1,2,3, with their initial token set to 'foo3', 'foo6', and 'foo9', respectively. ReplicationFactor is set to 2 on all 3.
2) Insert 9 columns with keys from 'foo1' to 'foo9', and flush. Now I have foo1,2,3,7,8,9 on cs1, foo1,2,3,4,5,6, on cs2, and foo4,5,6,7,8,9
on cs3. So far so good
3) Bring down cs3 and wipe out its data directory
4) Bring up cs3
5) run nodeprobe repair Keyspace1 on cs3, the flush
At this point I expect to see cs3 getting its data back. But there's nothing in its data directory. I also tried getting all columns with
ConsistencyLevel::ALL to see if that'll do a read pair. But still cs3's data directory is empty.
