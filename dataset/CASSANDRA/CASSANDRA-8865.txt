Summary:
DROP INDEX name case sensitivity causing errors in cass upgrade 2.0.10 to 2.1.3
Description:
We are upgrading our dev cluster. 2.0.10 to 2.1.3
The indexes are behaving very strangely.
create index definition_bundle__BundleDefSkuIDXTest on definition_bundle.entity_bundledef(e_entlinks) ;
definition_bundle> select column_name, index_name, index_options, index_type, component_index from system.schema_columns where keyspace_name = 'definition_bundle' and columnfamily_name = 'entity_bundledef';
column_name | index_name | index_options | index_type | component_index
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
bundle_sku | definition_bundle__BundleDefSkuIDX | {} | COMPOSITES | 1
e_entid | null | null | null | null
e_entlinks | definition_bundle__bundledefskuidxtest | {} | COMPOSITES | 1
NOTICE THE AUTO-DOWNCASE of our newly created index. The index that already existed is NOT AUTO-DOWNCASED. I don't know if this is recent or not.
We cannot drop the mixed case index. Nodetool index reconstruction did not work. Indexes are doing very weird things.
Hm. UPDATE:
This did successfully delete the index:
drop index "definition_bundle__BundleDefSkuIDX";
Anyway, it looks like there is some upcase/downcase assumptions not being properly done.... somewhere, either in upgrades or similar stuff.
We will probably drop our indexes and recreate them.
