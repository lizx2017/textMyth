Summary:
Skip mutations that pass CRC but fail to deserialize
Description:
We've had a couple reports of CL replay failure that appear to be caused by dropping and recreating the same table with a different schema, e.g. CASSANDRA-5905. While CASSANDRA-5202 is the "right" fix for this, it's too involved for 2.0 let alone 1.2, so we need a stopgap until then.
