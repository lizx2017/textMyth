Summary:
preserve KsDef backwards compatibility for Thrift clients
Description:
CASSANDRA-1263 broke client compatibility; we can't preserve it entirely (we'll continue to resturn replication_factor in strategy option rather than try to guess somehow if client is an old one) but we can accommodate old clients on write and leave the KsDef signature compatible which (I think) will make it easier for client authors.
