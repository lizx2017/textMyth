Summary:
OOM due to slow memory meter
Description:
Memory meter holds strong reference to memtable while it iterates over memtable cells. Because meter is not fast, it prevents memtable from being GCed after it has been flushed for some time.
If write rate is fast enough, this makes node OOM.
Fixed this by aborting metering if table becomes not active in datatracker, i.e. flushing or flushed.
