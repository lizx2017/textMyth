Summary:
Pig should throw a useful error when the destination CF doesn't exist
Description:
When trying to store data to nonexistent CF, no good error is returned.
Instead you get a message like:
[main] ERROR org.apache.pig.tools.grunt.Grunt - ERROR 2042: Error in new logical plan. Try -Dpig.usenewlogicalplan=false.
Which, if you follow its advice, will eventually lead you to an NPE in initSchema.
