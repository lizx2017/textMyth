Summary:
StorageService.setMode() is used inconsistently
Description:
StorageService.setMode(), which ends up setting the OperationMode attribute of the related mbean, is used inconsistently. In most places, it's used like "setMode("MODE: details"), but in a few places, it's used more like a normal log message.
To make this attribute more usable through JMX, setMode() should have a signature like setMode(mode, details), where the mode parameter could be an enum (or even just a string, the main thing is just being consistent). The OperationMode JMX attribute should definitely remain a string, though.
