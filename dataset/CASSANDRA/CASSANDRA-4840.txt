Summary:
remnants of removed nodes remain after removal
Description:
After nodes are removed from the ring and no longer appear in any of the nodes' nodetool ring output, some of the dead nodes show up in the o.a.c.net.FailureDetector SimpleStates metadata. Also, some of the JMX stats are updating for the removed nodes (ie RecentTimeoutsPerHost and ResponsePendingTasks).
