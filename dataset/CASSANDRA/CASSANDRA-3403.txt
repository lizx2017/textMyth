Summary:
describe_ring topology information is wrong/incomplete
Description:
In CASSANDRA-2882, topology information was added to describe_ring, however it asks the gossiper for the DC information, and the gossiper can only have this with a gossip-enabled snitch, which currently means the Ec2Snitch. Instead, it should be asking the snitch for the DC for each endpoint.
Also, the port information should just be removed: whatever port the client has connected to in order to call describe_ring is the right port to use for all endpoints.
