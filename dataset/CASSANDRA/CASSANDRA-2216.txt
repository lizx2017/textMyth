Summary:
Compaction can echo data which breaks upon sstable format changes
Description:
While compaction, if for a row we have only 1 sstable holding data, we echo this data. This breaks when we change the data format, creating mixed (corrupted) sstable.
(I suspect this is the cause of CASSANDRA-2195, but opening a new ticket until we can confirm that hunch)
