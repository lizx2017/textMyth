Summary:
StorageProxy throws an InvalidRequestException in readProtocol during bootstrap
Description:
Though the error message provides details, IRE is supposed to signify poorly formed API requests. In the context of a client request, an UnavailableException is more appropriate. This would allow the client to take action like removing the node from its host list.
