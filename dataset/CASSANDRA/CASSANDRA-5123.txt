Summary:
Multiget Supercolumns Sometimes Missing Results
Description:
Starting approximately with commit c2812f3 (the January 3rd nightly build by DataStax Jenkins, #669), a few of the pycassa unit tests related to multigetting a particular supercolumn started failing periodically. The nightly build is against Cassandra trunk.
You can reproduce with the pycassa unit tests fairly easily:
nosetests tests/test_columnfamily.py:TestSuperColumnFamily.test_multiget_supercolumn
It should fail within a few runs.
It looks like one of the requested keys isn't being returned at all.
