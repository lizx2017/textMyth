Summary:
Expose number of threads blocked on submitting a memtable for flush
Description:
Writes can be blocked by a thread trying to submit a memtable while the flush queue is full. While this is the expected behavior (the goal being to prevent OOMing), it is worth exposing when that happens so that people can monitor it and modify settings accordingly if that happens too often.
