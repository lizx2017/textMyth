Summary:
Cache capacity settings done via nodetool get reset on memtable flushes
Description:
In an experiment we set cache capacities via nodetool. The config file had the KeyCache for this CF at 1000000, we set the RowCache to 10000000 via nodetool.
The next time we flushed a memtable for that CF, the cache capacity settings got reverted to what is in the conf file. We repeated the experiment with the same results.
