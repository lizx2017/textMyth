Summary:
Pig should use the default comparator for slice_start/end
Description:
Pig allows specifying slice start and end, but by default uses a BytesType comparator for this, though it allows overriding with a 'comparator' param.
I believe this came from a time before pig was fully schema-aware, and made it more convenient if you had timeuuid, since writing the hex form 'EA' was easier than '
u234' which then you'd have to url escape.
Instead, pig should use the default comparator from the schema, but still allow overriding.
