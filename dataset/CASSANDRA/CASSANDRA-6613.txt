Summary:
Java 7u51 breaks internode encryption
Description:
With the latest update of the Oracle JRE (7u51) internode encryption no longer works, since none of the cipher suites (TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA,TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA) that Cassandra supports work anymore.
I see this in the log file:
WARN o.a.cassandra.security.SSLFactory - Filtering out TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA as it isnt supported by the socket
See http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/7u51-relnotes-2085002.html (all the way at the bottom) for more information.
