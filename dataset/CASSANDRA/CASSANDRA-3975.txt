Summary:
Hints Should Be Dropped When Missing CFid Implies Deleted ColumnFamily
Description:
If hints have accumulated for a CF that has been deleted, Hinted Handoff repeatedly fails until manual intervention removes those hints. For 1.0.7, UnserializableColumnFamilyException is thrown only when a CFid is unknown on the sending node. As discussed on #cassandra-dev, if the schema is in agreement, the affected hint(s) should be deleted to avoid indefinite repeat failures.
