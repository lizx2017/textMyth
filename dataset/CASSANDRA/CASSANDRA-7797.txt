Summary:
Cannot alter ReversedType(DateType) clustering column to ReversedType(TimestampType)
Description:
ReversedType doesn't override AbstractType.isCompatibleWith(), so ReversedType(TimestampType) is not considered compatible with ReversedType(DateType). It needs to verify that the other type is reversed and that the base types are compatible.
