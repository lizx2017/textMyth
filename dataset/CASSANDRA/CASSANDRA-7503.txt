Summary:
Windows - better communication on start-up failure
Description:
The Windows launch scripts report successful launch on certain failure conditions. For instance, if you try to start a 2nd instance of Cassandra and it fails to bind to the JMX port:
silent failure
D:\src\cassandra\bin>cassandra.bat
Detected powershell execution permissions.  Running with enhanced startup scripts.
Setting up Cassandra environment
Starting cassandra server
Started cassandra successfully with pid: 6520
-f failure
D:\src\cassandra\bin>cassandra.bat -f
Detected powershell execution permissions.  Running with enhanced startup scripts.
Setting up Cassandra environment
Starting cassandra server
Error: Exception thrown by the agent : java.rmi.server.ExportException: Port already in use: 7199; nested exception is:
        java.net.BindException: Address already in use: JVM_Bind
Reference CASSANDRA-7254 for linux-based solution to a similar NPE on startup due to duplicate JMX port-bind.
