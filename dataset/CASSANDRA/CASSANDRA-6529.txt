Summary:
sstableloader shows no progress or errors when pointed at a bad directory
Description:
With sstableloader, the source directory is supposed to be in the format <keyspace_name>/<table_name>/. If you incorrectly just put the sstables in a <keyspace_name>/ directory, the sstableloader process will not show any progress, errors, or other output, it will simply hang.
