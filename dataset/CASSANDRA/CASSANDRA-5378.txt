Summary:
Fat Client: No longer works in 1.2
Description:
The current client only example doesn't compile. After doing some updates, the fat client still won't work, mainly because the schema is not being pushed to the fat client.
I've made changes to the client to support CQL3 commands, to the ServiceManager to wait until a migration has completed before starting the client, and to the MigrationManager to not try to pull schemas from a fat client.
