Summary:
HSHA doesn't handle large messages gracefully
Description:
HSHA doesn't seem to enforce any kind of max message length, and when messages are too large, it doesn't fail gracefully.
With debug logs enabled, you'll see this:
DEBUG 13:13:31,805 Unexpected state 16
Which seems to mean that there's a SelectionKey that's valid, but isn't ready for reading, writing, or accepting.
Client-side, you'll get this thrift error (while trying to read a frame as part of recv_batch_mutate):
TTransportException: TSocket read 0 bytes
