Summary:
Requests unnecessarily redirected with CL=ONE
Description:
Three-node cluster with RF=3. All data currently in sync.
Network topology strategy. Each node defined to be on a different rack.
endpoint_snitch: PropertyFileSnitch
dynamic_snitch_update_interval_in_ms: 100
dynamic_snitch_reset_interval_in_ms: 600000
dynamic_snitch_badness_threshold: 0
All tables defined with read_repair_chance=0
From cqlsh when querying with Consistency=ONE tracing shows that requests get frequently redirected to other nodes even though the local node has the data.
There is no other activity on the cluster besides my test queries.
