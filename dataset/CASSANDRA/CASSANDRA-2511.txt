Summary:
Need to forward merge parts of r1088800 to make the pig CassandraStorage build
Description:
Parts of revision 1088800 weren't forward merged into 0.8/trunk. So the 0.8/trunk version of CassandraStorage doesn't currently build. Specifically, it needs the decompose method in the AbstractType hierarchy.
