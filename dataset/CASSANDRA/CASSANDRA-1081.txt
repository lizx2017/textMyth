Summary:
Thrift sockets leak in 0.6 hadoop interface
Description:
Thrift connections appear not to be closed properly in 0.6 in ColumnFamilyRecordReader, which causes a file descriptor leak on the server and may eventually cause jobs to fail.
This appear to be fixed in 0.7 https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-1017 so it may be worth backporting the patch or add a quick fix to close the Tsockets.
