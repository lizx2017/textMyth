Summary:
UnavailableException after bootstrapping a previously decommissioned node
Description:
In trunk (not in 0.7), if I boostrap a node, decommission it and boostrap it back (after having clean all data directory but on same ip), I get UnavailableException on read.
I've bisected the regression to r1067508.
