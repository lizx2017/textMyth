Summary:
Directories.migrateFile() does not handle -old or -tmp LDB manifests
Description:
During LDB compaction a -old.json file is created with the previous manifest.
Directories.migrateFile() only checks for the .json extension and uses the length to determine the CF name.
This can result in the -old.json manifest getting copied to a CF-old directory in the new layout.
