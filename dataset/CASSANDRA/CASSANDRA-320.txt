Summary:
Memtable sometimes not enqueued for flush
Description:
There appears to be a (rare) race condition with flushing memtables. Occasionally, when Cassandra is in the process of flushing a table, another switch will occur. The latter table will be added to memtablesPendingFlush in ColumnFamilyStore, but it will not be enqueued for flush and thus hang around forever. Adding an else clause and a print statement to Memtable.java's enqueueFlush method reveals that the memtable is not being flushed because isFrozen_ is already true.
