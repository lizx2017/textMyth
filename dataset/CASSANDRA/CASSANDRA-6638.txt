Summary:
SSTableScanner can Skip Rows with vnodes
Description:
CASSANDRA-2524 added multiple range support to SSTableScanner, but it looks like there is at least one case where keys can be skipped. This can result in cleanup removing legitimate keys.
See the attached patch that adds a unit test to reproduce the case.
