Summary:
Fix "java.lang.IllegalStateException: No configured daemon" in tests
Description:
Tests that use StorageService.instance.initServer() ends up logging the following error after their execution:
    [junit] Exception in thread "StorageServiceShutdownHook" java.lang.IllegalStateException: No configured daemon
    [junit]  at org.apache.cassandra.service.StorageService.stopRPCServer(StorageService.java:309)
    [junit]  at org.apache.cassandra.service.StorageService.shutdownClientServers(StorageService.java:381)
...
It's harmless to the tests since it's in the ShutdownDownHook but we should "fix" it at some point.
