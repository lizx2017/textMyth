Summary:
SuperColumn may ignore relevant tombstones
Description:
QueryFilter.isRelevant() consider that a super column that is gc-able but contains only non-gcable tombstone is irrelevant (if the tombstone timestmap is greater than the super column timestamp, which is almost implied by the fact that the tombstone are non-gcable while the SC is).
