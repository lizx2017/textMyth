Summary:
Fix update of CF comparator (including adding new collections)
Description:
Updating the comparator of a column family (which is authorized if the new comparator is "compatible" with the old one, and that includes adding a new component to a CompositeType, or adding a new collection to a CQL3 table) doesn't completely work. The problem is that even if we change the comparator in CFMetada, the old comparator will still be aliased by the current memtable. This means updates (that expect the new comparator) will fail until a new memtable is created.
