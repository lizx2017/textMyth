Summary:
Disallow renaming columns one at a time when when the table don't have CQL3 metadata yet
Description:
As noted in CASSANDRA-5489, if you have a "thrift" CF, say:
[default@ks] create column family test with comparator='CompositeType(Int32Type, Int32Type, Int32Type)' and key_validation_class=UTF8Type and default_validation_class=UTF8Type;
And that trying to use it in CQL3 you rename the columns one at a time, you can get:
cqlsh:ks> DESC COLUMNFAMILY test;

CREATE TABLE test (
  key text,
  column1 int,
  column2 int,
  column3 int,
  value text,
  PRIMARY KEY (key, column1, column2, column3)
) WITH COMPACT STORAGE ...
cqlsh:ks> ALTER TABLE test RENAME column2 TO foo;
TSocket read 0 bytes
No, it happens that renaming the columns one at a time is a bad idea anyway as it can confuse the CQL3 code in some cases. So I suggest to disallow that and to force renaming all columns in one request the first you use a thrift CF from CQL3.
To be clear, you will still be able to rename columns one at a time in general, it's just for the first time you rename on a metadata-less CF. So overall that's a very small limitation and it simplify our lives code-wise.
See CASSANDRA-5489 for a bit more context here.
