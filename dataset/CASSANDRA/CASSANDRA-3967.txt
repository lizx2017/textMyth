Summary:
Test fixes for Windows
Description:
SchemaLoader initializes CommitLog, creating empty segments; CleanupHelper then errors out trying to delete them (because they are still open)
CFS.clearUnsafe resets the sstable generation but does not remove the sstables involved, so Windows will error out trying to rename over the existing ones
