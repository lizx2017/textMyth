Summary:
Fix validation of dates
Description:
Our date validation (timestamp type) doesn't validate that the date is correct, i.e. it allows dates like 2011-42-42, because DateUtils.parseDate() doesn't do the validation (don't ask me how it can generate a timestamp from bogus date, apparently it can).
The easy fix is to use DateUtils.parseDateStrictly(), which does the validation. This does require to update commons-lang to >= 2.5 (we have 2.4).
