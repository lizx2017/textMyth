Summary:
CFS reloading of the compaction strategy is done for every metadata update and is not thread safe
Description:
The reloading of the compaction strategy done during CFS.reload is not thread safe. In particular, this is a problem for leveled compactions. It could leads to some sstable not being added to the manifest and also breaks the 'only one leveledCompactionTask can run at any given time' assumption (which, at least without CASSANDRA-3408 can likely leads to blocking compactions completely).
