Summary:
Actually uses efficient cross DC writes
Description:
CASSANDRA-2138 introduced the following code:
if (dataCenter.equals(localDataCenter) || StorageService.instance.useEfficientCrossDCWrites())
{
    // direct writes to local DC or old Cassadra versions
    for (InetAddress destination : messages.getValue())
        MessagingService.instance().sendRR(message, destination, handler);
}
else
{
    // Non-local DC. First endpoint in list is the destination for this group
A 'not' is missing on that useEfficientCrossDCWrites call (which does return true for any version >= 0.7.1).
A simple fix would be to add the missing !, but as said a comment, all this code should have been removed in 0.8 since it was detecting nodes before 0.7.1, but direct upgrade from pre-0.7.1 to 0.8+ is not supported. So let's just completely remove that code now.
