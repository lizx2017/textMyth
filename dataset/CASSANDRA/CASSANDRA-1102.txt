Summary:
Call to loadbalance cause ava.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: data is currently moving to this node; unable to leave the ring
Description:
When I am trying to run loadbalance, I got the following error message:
[root@cas2 bin]# sh nodetool -h localhost loadbalance
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: data is
currently moving to this node; unable to leave the ring
I am actually run loadbalance on another node, but it was 3-4 days ago, I
have just 100GB data (3 nodes), so I expect that data relocate should be
already done.
streams show nothing interest too:
===
[root@cas2 bin]# sh nodetool -h localhost streams
Mode: Node is drained
Nothing streaming to /172.19.0.30
Not receiving any streams.
[root@cas2 bin]#
===
After cluster restart it works ok.
