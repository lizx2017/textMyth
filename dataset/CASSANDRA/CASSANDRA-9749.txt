Summary:
CommitLogReplayer continues startup after encountering errors
Description:
There are a few places where the commit log recovery method either skips sections or just returns when it encounters errors.
Specifically if it can't read the header here: https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/trunk/src/java/org/apache/cassandra/db/commitlog/CommitLogReplayer.java#L298
Or if there are compressor problems here: https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/trunk/src/java/org/apache/cassandra/db/commitlog/CommitLogReplayer.java#L314 and here: https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/trunk/src/java/org/apache/cassandra/db/commitlog/CommitLogReplayer.java#L366
Whether these are user-fixable or not, I think we should require more direct user intervention (ie: fix what's wrong, or remove the bad file and restart) since we're basically losing data.
