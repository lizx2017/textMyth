Summary:
read repair: NEWS does not match actual behavior
Description:
NEWS says:
    - Hinted Handoff is substantially more robust, with the result that
      when HH is enabled, repair only needs to be run if a node crashes.
    - Because of this, read repair is disabled now by default on newly
      created ColumnFamilies.
But default RR value is still 1.0.
