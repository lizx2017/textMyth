Summary:
COPY TO command doesn't escape single quote in collections
Description:
CREATE TABLE test (key text PRIMARY KEY , testcollection set<text>) ;
INSERT INTO test (key, testcollection ) VALUES ( 'test', {'foo''bar'});
COPY test TO '/tmp/test.csv';
COPY test FROM '/tmp/test.csv';

Bad Request: line 1:73 mismatched character '<EOF>' expecting '''
Aborting import at record #0 (line 1). Previously-inserted values still present.
Content of generated '/tmp/test.csv':
test,{'foo'bar'}
Unfortunately, I didn't find workaround with any combination of COPY options
