Summary:
Repair hangs if a neighbor has nothing to send
Description:
This is actually a streaming problem. If a StreamOutSession has nothing to transfer (i.e, no sstables have the requested ranges), it will not even initiate the transfer and simply close the session right away. The problem is that if the session was initiated by a remote end (through a StreamRequestMessage), the remote end will never be notified and never run his callback.
