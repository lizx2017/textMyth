Summary:
incremental repair dtest flaps on 2.2
Description:
incremental_repair_test.py:TestIncRepair.multiple_subsequent_repair_test flaps on 2.2. It's hard to tell what failures are repair-specific, but there are a few distinct failures I've seen recently:
an NPE in StorageService
an NPE in SSTableRewriter. I believe this is related to CASSANDRA-9730, but someone should confirm this.
an on-disk data size that is too large
You can find the test itself here on GitHub and run it with the command
CASSANDRA_VERSION=git:trunk nosetests incremental_repair_test.py:TestIncRepair.multiple_subsequent_repair_test
Assigning Yuki Morishita, since you're the repair person, but feel free to reassign to whoever's appropriate.
