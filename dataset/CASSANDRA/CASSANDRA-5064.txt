Summary:
'Alter table' when it includes collections makes cqlsh hang
Description:
Having just installed 1.2.0-beta3 issue the following CQL into cqlsh:
drop keyspace test;

create keyspace test with replication = {
          'class': 'SimpleStrategy',
          'replication_factor': '1'
        };

use test;

create table users (
            user_id text PRIMARY KEY,
            first_name text,
            last_name text,
            email_addresses set<text>
        );

alter table users add mailing_address_lines list<text>;
As soon as you issue the alter table statement cqlsh hangs, and the java process hosting Cassandra consumes 100% of a single core's CPU.
If the alter table doesn't include a collection, it runs fine.
