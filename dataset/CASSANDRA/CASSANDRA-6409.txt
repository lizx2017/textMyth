Summary:
gossip performance improvement at node startup
Description:
With large clusters (> 500 nodes) and num_tokens > 255 we sometimes see a node have trouble starting up. CPU usage for one thread is pegged.
We see this concurrent with Gossip flaps on the node trying to learn the ring topology. Other nodes on the ring, that are already at steady state do not seem to suffer. It is the node joining the large ring that has trouble.
