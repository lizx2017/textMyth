Summary:
AssertionError 'Incoherent new size -1' during hints compaction
Description:
I've seen the error on 2.0.9:
java.lang.AssertionError: Incoherent new size -1 replacing [SSTableReader(path='/cassandra/d1/data/system/hints/system-hints-jb-24386-Data.db')] by [] in View(pending_count=0, sstables=[], compacting=[SSTableReader(path='/cassandra/d1/data/system/hints/system-hints-jb-24386-Data.db')])
in logs during hints compaction. It looks like there are 2 concurrent compactions of the same file - just before this error the logs say:
INFO [CompactionExecutor:220316] 2014-11-19 22:53:54,650 CompactionTask.java (line 115) Compacting [SSTableReader(path='/cassandra/d1/data/system/hints/system-hints-jb-24386-Data.db')]
INFO [CompactionExecutor:220315] 2014-11-19 22:53:54,651 CompactionTask.java (line 115) Compacting [SSTableReader(path='/cassandra/d1/data/system/hints/system-hints-jb-24386-Data.db')]
The assertion is:
int newSSTablesSize = sstables.size() - oldSSTables.size() + Iterables.size(replacements);
assert newSSTablesSize >= Iterables.size(replacements) : String.format("Incoherent new size %d replacing %s by %s in %s", newSSTablesSize, oldSSTables, replacements, this);
So if the first compaction completes, the second one has sstables=[] (as seen in the assertion failure print), so newSSTablesSize = 0 - 1 + 0 = -1 and we get the error.
It is possible the root cause is the same as CASSANDRA-7145. Does anyone know how to tell? The error happens very rarely so hard to know from testing.
