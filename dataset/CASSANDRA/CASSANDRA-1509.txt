Summary:
CassandraServiceDataCleaner doesn't remove subdirectories properly
Description:
CassandraServiceDataCleaner.cleanDir assumes all files in the directory are normal files, not directories. Suggested fix is to change FileUtils.delete(dirFile.listFiles()) to FileUtils.deleteRecursive(f) to remove recursively which will delete all data files.
