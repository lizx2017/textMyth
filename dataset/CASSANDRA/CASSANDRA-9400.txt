Summary:
smallint, tinyint, date + time types in UDFs
Description:
Cassandra 2.2 adds new types smallint, tinyint, {{date + time.
However the bundled Java driver does not support them.
There are two options:
Do not allow the new types smallint, tinyint, date + time for UDFs
Use a new Java Driver version that can handle these types.
Probably we should go with option 1 and update the driver in a 2.2.x release?
