Summary:
Cache Providers calculate very different row sizes
Description:
Took the same production node and bounced it 4 times comparing version and cache provider. ConcurrentLinkedHashCacheProvider and SerializingCacheProvider produce very different results resulting in an order of magnitude difference in rows cached. In all cases the row cache size was 2048 MB. Hit rate is provided for color, but entries & size are the important part.
1.2.8 ConcurrentLinkedHashCacheProvider:
entries: 23,217
hit rate: 43%
size: 2,147,398,344
1.2.8 about 20 minutes of SerializingCacheProvider:
entries: 221,709
hit rate: 68%
size: 18,417254
1.2.5 ConcurrentLinkedHashCacheProvider:
entries: 25,967
hit rate: ~ 50%
size: 2,147,421,704
1.2.5 about 20 minutes of SerializingCacheProvider:
entries: 228,457
hit rate: ~ 70%
size: 19,070,315
A related problem is that the ConcurrentLinkedHashCacheProvider sizes seem to be highly variable. Digging up the values for 5 different nodes in the cluster using ConcurrentLinkedHashCacheProvider shows a wide variance in number of entries:
