Summary:
cqlsh won't startup
Description:
Scales library is missing
../lib/cassandra-driver-internal-only-1.0.2.post.zip/cassandra-driver-1.0.2.post/cassandra/metrics.py", line 4, in <module>
ImportError: No module named greplin
It would be useful if users don't have to install scales explicitly for the functioning of cqlsh
