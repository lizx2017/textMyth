Summary:
system tests fail straingely if an instance is running
Description:
The system tests blow up spectacularly if there is another instance of cassandra running (and it can be difficult to tell that this is why). Having the harness start its instance using alternate ports would prevent this from happening in some cases, but something should be done to test for instances left over from failed tests, and at least produce clearer error messages.
