Summary:
NPE on invalid CQL DELETE command
Description:
The CQL command delete from k where key='bar'; causes Cassandra to hit a NullPointerException when the "k" column family does not exist, and it subsequently closes the Thrift connection instead of reporting an IRE or whatever. This is probably wrong.
