Summary:
Visibility issue in StreamSession
Description:
StreamSession should have concurrent requests and transfers because of visibility.
In the start() method, we create a new thread which calls onInitializationComplete();
In onInitializationComplete(), we copy the requests and transfers into PrepareMessage.
Since this is a separate thread, it might not see all the contents of requests and transfers.
