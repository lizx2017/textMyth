Summary:
cqlsh doesn't allow semicolons in BATCH statements
Description:
The documentation for BATCH statements declares that semicolons are required between update operations. Currently including them results in an error 'expecting K_APPLY'. To match the design specifications, semi-colons should be allowed or optional.
