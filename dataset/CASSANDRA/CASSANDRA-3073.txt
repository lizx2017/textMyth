Summary:
liveSize() calculation is wrong in case of overwrite
Description:
currently liveSize() is the sum of currentThroughput.
this definition is wrong if most of the operations are overwrite, or counter (which is essentially overwrite).
for example, the following code should always keep a single entry in db, with one row, one cf, one column, and supposedly should have a size of only about 100 bytes.
connect localhost/9160;
create keyspace blah;
use blah;
create column family cf2 with memtable_throughput=1024 and memtable_operations=10000 ;
set the cassandra.yaml
memtable_total_space_in_mb: 20
to make the error appear faster (but if u set to default, still same issue will appear)
then we use a simple pycassa script:
>>> pool = pycassa.connect('blah')
>>> mycf = pycassa.ColumnFamily(pool,"cf2");
>>> for x in range(1,10000000) :
... xx = mycf.insert('key1',{'col1':"{}".format})
...
you will see sstables being generated with only sizes of a few k, though we set the CF options to get high SSTable sizes
