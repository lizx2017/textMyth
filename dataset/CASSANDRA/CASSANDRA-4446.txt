Summary:
nodetool drain sometimes doesn't mark commitlog fully flushed
Description:
I recently wiped a customer's QA cluster. I drained each node and verified that they were drained. When I restarted the nodes, I saw the commitlog replay create a memtable and then flush it. I have attached a sanitized log snippet from a representative node at the time.
It appears to show the following :
1) Drain begins
2) Drain triggers flush
3) Flush triggers compaction
4) StorageService logs DRAINED message
5) compaction thread excepts
6) on restart, same CF creates a memtable
7) and then flushes it [1]
The columnfamily involved in the replay in 7) is the CF for which the compaction thread excepted in 5). This seems to suggest a timing issue whereby the exception in 5) prevents the flush in 3) from marking all the segments flushed, causing them to replay after restart.
In case it might be relevant, I did an online change of compaction strategy from Leveled to SizeTiered during the uptime period preceding this drain.
[1] Isn't commitlog replay not supposed to automatically trigger a flush in modern cassandra?
