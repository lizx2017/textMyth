Summary:
Column family deletion time is not always reseted after gc_grace
Description:
Follow up of CASSANDRA-2305.
Reproducible (thanks to Jeffrey Wang) by:
Create a CF with gc_grace_seconds = 0 and no row cache.
Insert row X, col A with timestamp 0.
Insert row X, col B with timestamp 2.
Remove row X with timestamp 1 (expect col A to disappear, col B to stay).
Wait 1 second.
Force flush and compaction.
Insert row X, col A with timestamp 0.
Read row X, col A (see nothing).
