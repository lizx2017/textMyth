Summary:
CqlConfigHelper disables the connection pool for remote hosts while the remote hosts can be used
Description:
This is introduced by CASSANDRA-7774. The new load balancing policy does not allow using non-replica hosts, but it distinguishes local replica and remote replica, and returns them in appropriate order. However, CqlConfigHelper disables remote hosts completely.
