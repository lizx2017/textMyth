Summary:
cassandra-env.sh doesn't handle correctly non numeric JDK versions
Description:
Trying to work around a JDK bug, I've installed a Early Access release of the JDK, which lead to a small, non-blocking error, in cassandra-env.sh as it expects the patch part of the JDK version to be a number, but on Oracle EA JDKs, the patch number is followed by an -ea qualifier as in:
$ java -version
java version "1.7.0_80-ea"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_80-ea-b02)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 24.80-b07, mixed mode)
This lead to the following error:
bin/../conf/cassandra-env.sh: line 102: [: 80-ea: integer expression expected
Obviously not a big deal, but we may want to cover this corner case properly by just ignoring the qualifier part of the version.
