Summary:
Hadoop streaming -> Cassandra ColumnFamilyOutputFormat not respecting partitioner
Description:
The Hadoop streaming shim (hadoop streaming client => avro => ColumnFamilyOutputFormat => cassandra ring) is only connecting to one or a couple clients on the ring. With 24 hadoop clients launched, ` sudo netstat -antp | grep 9160 | wc -l ` gave 24 on one machine, and only 1-3 on any other node.
I'll attach the script and runner I used.
