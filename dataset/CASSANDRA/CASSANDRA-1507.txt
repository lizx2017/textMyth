Summary:
make adaptive heap size calculation portable
Description:
The adaptive heap size calculation is dependent on the 'free' tool which is typically available on Linux machines (GNU toolset) but not others.
I'm attaching a patch which makes FreeBSD specifically supported as well as falling back to static 1024m default if the operating system is unrecognized.
