Summary:
Zero length BigInteger exception causing processing to freeze
Description:
We attempted to migrate our developers to Cassandra 2.0.7 from 1.2.
Everything worked perfectly, but we have experienced a massive drop in developer velocity.
We run integration tests with Cucumber BDD and 1000 BDDs went from 7 minutes (Cassandra 1.2) to 15 minutes (2.0.7),
This is when we run Cassandra of the ramdisk (/dev/shm) to make it run faster on dev boxes.
When we tried pointed to actual drives the difference was dramatic: the entire suite took over 70 minutes vs 15 in Cassandra 1.2.
After investigation, we found that most of the time is spent in the truncation logic between every scenario, where we truncate all the column families and start with a clean DB for the next test case.
This used to be super fast in 1.2, is now very slow in 2.0.
It may not seem important, but upgrading to 2.0 has basically cut down developer velocity by 100%, just by more than doubling the time it takes to run our BDD suite.
We truncate the CFs using the Ruby driver:
$cassandra.column_families.each do |column_family|
name = column_family[0].to_s
$cassandra.truncate! name
end
I am attaching our cassandra.yaml. Please note we already switched off auto_compaction before truncate, just as we did in 1.2 for dev boxes, Made no difference.
