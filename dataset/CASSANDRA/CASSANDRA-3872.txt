Summary:
Sub-columns removal is broken in 1.1
Description:
CASSANDRA-3716 actually broke sub-columns deletion. The reason is that in QueryFilter.isRelevant, we've switched in checking getLocalDeletionTime() only (without looking for isMarkedForDelete). But for columns containers (in this case SuperColumn), the default local deletion time when not deleted is Integer.MIN_VALUE. In other words, a SC with only non-gcable tombstones will be considered as not relevant (while it should).
This is caught by two unit tests (RemoveSuperColumnTest and RemoveSubColumnTest) that are failing currently.
