Summary:
Build does not handle ANTLR generated code properly
Description:
The default ant target does not trigger generation of code from Cli.g and Cql.g
The clean target does not remove generated files
The targets gen-cli-grammar and gen-cql-grammar do not reference current locations of Cli.g and Cql.g
Generated files are commited in svn repository (by mistake?)
