Summary:
CFS.setMaxCompactionThreshold doesn't allow 0 unless min is also 0
Description:
Thrift allows to set the max compaction threshold to 0 to disable compaction. However, CFS.setMaxCompactionThreshold throws an exception min > max even if max is 0.
Note that even if someone sets 0 for both the min and max thresholds, we'll can have a problem because SizeTieredCompaction calls CFS.setMaxCompactionThreshold before calling CFS.setMinCompactionThreshold and thus will trigger the RuntimeException when it shouldn't.
