Summary:
clean up messagingservice protocol limitations
Description:
Weaknesses of the existing protocol:
information asymmetry: node A can know what version node B expects, but not vice versa (see CASSANDRA-4101)
delayed information: node A will often not know what version node B expects, until after first contacting node B â€“ forcing it to throw that first message away and retry for the next one
protocol cannot handle both cross-dc forwarding and broadcast_address != socket address (see bottom of CASSANDRA-4099)
version is partly global, partly per-connection, and partly per-message, resulting in some interesting hacks (CASSANDRA-3166) and difficulty layering more sophisticated OutputStreams on the socket (CASSANDRA-3127, CASSANDRA-4139)
