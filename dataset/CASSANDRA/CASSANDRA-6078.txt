Summary:
Wrong memtable size estimation: liveRatio is not honored in edge cases
Description:
Memtable.getLiveSize does not honours liveRatio the correct way:
allocator.get**Size() return sizes allocated only by name and columns data (i.e. no liveRatio applied); but conditions, which cap estimated size, compare it with estimatedSize, already multiplied by liveRatio.
If liveRatio is big enough (i've seen >11 on our dataset), this leads to huge estimation errors and even to OutOfMemory, because MeteredFlusher underestimates memtables sizes.
