Summary:
Some Thrift Exceptions not passed down to Client
Description:
We still don't pass all exceptions down to client via Thrift. We have seen a few of these when working on our client library:
org.apache.thrift.protocol.TProtocolException: Required field 'start' was not present! Struct: SliceRange(start:null, finish:null, reversed:false, count:100)
Would be good if those exceptions were passed down, instead of 'TSocket Read 0 Bytes'.
