Summary:
Static variables with small page sizes
Description:
Selecting static variables with small page sizes causes them to display as None. With large page sizes and non-static variables, test still pass. Works fine in 2.1.x. Not sure if it runs in 2.2.x (I can't seem to run C* version 2.2.x).
Run the test below to see error. Remove the "list" on line 21 to see what's actually erroring.
Related to 8502.
