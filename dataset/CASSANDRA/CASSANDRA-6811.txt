Summary:
nodetool no longer shows node joining
Description:
When we added effective ownership output to nodetool ring/status, we accidentally began excluding joining nodes because we iterate the ownership maps instead of the the endpoint to token map when printing the output, and the joining nodes don't have any ownership. The simplest thing to do is probably iterate the token map instead, and not output any ownership info for joining nodes.
