Summary:
rows_per_partition_to_cache is not reflected in table DESCRIBE
Description:
I can create a table with the new query cache from CASSANDRA-5357:
CREATE TABLE status (user text, status_id timeuuid, status text, PRIMARY KEY (user, status_id)) WITH caching = '{"keys":"ALL", "rows_per_partition":"10"}';
This method appears to work fine.
However, that is not the syntax mentioned in that ticket. It says to use a rows_per_partition_to_cache setting instead, which does appear to work in cql:
CREATE TABLE status2 (user text, status_id timeuuid, status text, PRIMARY KEY (user, status_id)) WITH rows_per_partition_to_cache = 200;
But that setting is not reflected in the table description, instead it still shows NONE:
cqlsh:test> DESCRIBE TABLE status2;

CREATE TABLE test.status2 (
    user text,
    status_id timeuuid,
    status text,
    PRIMARY KEY (user, status_id)
) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (status_id ASC)
    AND caching = '{"keys":"ALL", "rows_per_partition":"NONE"}'
    ...
Similarly, alter table with that syntax, does not produce an error, but also does not seem to affect the setting :
ALTER TABLE test.status WITH rows_per_partition_to_cache = 200;
