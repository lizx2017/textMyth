Summary:
cassandra-cli still relies on cassandra.in.sh instead of cassandra-env.sh
Description:
When we switched to cassandra-env.sh, we neglected to change the cli as well. This leads to people unable to launch to the client due to heap size, and not having any idea how to change the heap for the cli itself.
