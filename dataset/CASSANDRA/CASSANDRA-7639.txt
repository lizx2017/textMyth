Summary:
Cqlsh cannot use .csv files exported by Excel
Description:
When performing COPY table FROM 'test.csv' on cqlsh across any of the three major branches (1.2, 2.0, 2.1), the following error is thrown:
new-line character seen in unquoted field - do you need to open the file in universal-newline mode?
This happens if the .csv file has windows style line endings, such as if it was created by saving a .csv from excel. This reproduces in both unix and windows environments. This is a simple enough fix. I found that running dos2unix on csv files generated by excel was not sufficient to correct the issue.
