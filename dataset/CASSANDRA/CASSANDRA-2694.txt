Summary:
stop JDBC driver from needing access to cassandra.yaml
Description:
The JDBC driver uses CFMetaData.fromThrift(), it was calling validateMemtableSettings() which used static methods on DatabaseDescriptor. This causes cassandra.yaml to be loaded and means the client side needs access to the file.
I think this needs to be fixed for 0.8, I have the patch.
*Updated* changed title from "remove references to DatabaseDescriptor in CFMetaData"
