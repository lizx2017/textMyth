Summary:
Failure to open sstable after upgrade to trunk
Description:
After upgrading a 3 node cluster on the path 1.2.19 -> 2.0.16 -> 2.1-head -> 2.2-head -> trunk
ERROR [SSTableBatchOpen:1] 2015-06-25 17:16:55,424 SSTableReader.java:435 - Cannot open /tmp/dtest-Ibi6zm/test/node1/data/upgrade/cf/la-7-big; partitioner org.apache.cassandra.dht.LocalPartitioner does not match system partitioner org.apache.cassandra.dht.Murmur3Partitioner.  Note that the default partitioner starting with Cassandra 1.2 is Murmur3Partitioner, so you will need to edit that to match your old partitioner if upgrading.
ERROR [SSTableBatchOpen:2] 2015-06-25 17:16:55,425 SSTableReader.java:435 - Cannot open /tmp/dtest-Ibi6zm/test/node1/data/upgrade/cf/la-10-big; partitioner org.apache.cassandra.dht.LocalPartitioner does not match system partitioner org.apache.cassandra.dht.Murmur3Partitioner.  Note that the default partitioner starting with Cassandra 1.2 is Murmur3Partitioner, so you will need to edit that to match your old partitioner if upgrading.
Node logs are attached.
To reproduce, you'll need to run the upgrade dtest as follows:
nosetests -sv upgrade_through_versions_test.py:TestUpgradeThroughVersions.upgrade_test. I don't have CI results for this yet, nor will I soon. To run this, you'll need both JDK7 and JDK8 installed, for compilation reasons. Set the env vars JAVA7_HOME and JAVA8_HOME, respectively. I'll work on finding an sstable that represent the issue.
