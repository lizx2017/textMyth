Summary:
Password stored in cqlshrc file does not work with % character
Description:
Passwords stored in the cqlshrc file that contain the % character do not work.
For example: BD%^r9dSv!z
The workaround is to escape it with an additional %
e.g. BD%%^r9dSv!z
It would be better if this was done automatically rather than having to add escape characters to the cqlshrc file.
