Summary:
Failed Streams Break Repair
Description:
Running repair in cases where a stream fails we are seeing multiple problems.
1. Although retry is initiated and completes, the old stream doesn't seem to clean itself up and repair hangs.
2. The temp files are left behind and multiple failures can end up filling up the data partition.
These issues together are making repair very difficult for nearly everyone running repair on a non-trivial sized data set.
This issue is also being worked on w.r.t CASSANDRA-2088, however that was moved to 0.8 for a few reasons. This ticket is to fix the immediate issues that we are seeing in 0.7.
