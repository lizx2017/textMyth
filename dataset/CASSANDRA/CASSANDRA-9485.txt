Summary:
RangeTombstoneListTest.addAllRandomTest failed on trunk
Description:
http://cassci.datastax.com/job/trunk_utest/201/testReport/org.apache.cassandra.db/RangeTombstoneListTest/addAllRandomTest/
The test is also broken for reproducibility. It doesn't print the seed used for the RNG so it isn't possible to take a failing run and reproduce it.
