Summary:
Empty IN Clause still returns data
Description:
The dtest cql_tests.py:TestCQL.empty_in_test is failing on trunk HEAD but not on 2.1-HEAD.
The test uses the following table:
 CREATE TABLE test (k1 int, k2 int, v int, PRIMARY KEY (k1, k2)) 
then performs a number of inserts.
The test then asserts that
 SELECT v FROM test WHERE k1 = 0 AND k2 IN () 
returns no data, however it is returning everywhere k1 = 0.
