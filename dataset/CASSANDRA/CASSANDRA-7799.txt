Summary:
cassandra-env.sh doesn't detect openjdk version numbers
Description:
Cassandra fails to start with openjdk with the error:
Cassandra 2.0 and later require Java 7u25 or later.
This commit broke it:
https://github.com/apache/cassandra/commit/87548095859c210e7be8cc8bbb4a5aa1f857a6ad
My openjdk version string looks like:
vagrant@cnode1:~/fab/cassandra$ java -version
openjdk version "1.7.0-u60-unofficial"
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0-u60-unofficial-b30)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 24.60-b09, mixed mode)
Which this change does not parse properly.
