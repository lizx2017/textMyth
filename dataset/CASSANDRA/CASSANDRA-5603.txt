Summary:
YamlFileNetworkTopologySnitch doesn't call reconnectViaPreferredAddress in onChange
Description:
I was looking into how EC2 Multi Region did its magic with the private/public ips for the local network. YamlFileNetworkTopologySnitch looks like it tries to do the same thing, but it doesn't do the reconnectViaPreferredAddress in onChange. Don't know if it is technically needed, but EC2MRS reconnects in onJoin, onChange, and onAlive. While YamlFileNetworkTopologySnitch only does it in onJoin and onAlive.
