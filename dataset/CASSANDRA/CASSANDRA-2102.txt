Summary:
saved row cache doesn't save the cache
Description:
saving row caches works by periodically iterating of the keySet() on the caches and writing the keys for the cached contents to disk. The cache keys are DecoratedKeys. DecoratedKeys contain a Token token and a ByteBuffer key. The underlying buffer on the key gets reused so the contents change. This means that all the cache entries have distinct tokens but only a handful of distinct key values. This means that when the cache is loaded you only end up loading a handful of keys instead of the ones actually in your cache.
