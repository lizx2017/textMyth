Summary:
CQL: cqlsh does shows Exception, but not error message when running truncate while a node is down.
Description:
This is really just a usability bug, but it would nice to bubble the error message that is printed in the log file up to the interface.
cqlsh output
cqlsh> truncate users;
Exception: UnavailableException()
log file error
 INFO [pool-2-thread-5] 2011-04-21 23:53:30,466 StorageProxy.java (line 1021) Cannot perform truncate, some hosts are down
