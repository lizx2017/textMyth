Summary:
Can not query secondary index
Description:
Noticed after taking a column family that already existed and assigning to an IntegerType index_type:KEYS and the caching was already set to 'ALL' that the prepared statement do not return rows neither did it throw an exception. Here is the sequence.
1. Starting state query running with caching off for a Column Family with the query using the secondary index for te WHERE clause.
2, Set Column Family caching to ALL using Cassandra-CLI and update CQL. Cassandra-cli Describe shows column family caching set to ALL
3. Rerun query and it works.
4. Restart Cassandra and run query and no rows returned. Cassandra-cli Describe shows column family caching set to ALL
5. Set Column Family caching to NONE using Cassandra-cli and update CQL. Rerun query and no rows returned. Cassandra-cli Describe for column family shows caching set to NONE.
6. Restart Cassandra. Rerun query and it is working again. We are now back to the starting state.
