Summary:
Counter writes shouldn't be resubmitted after timeouts
Description:
CASSANDRA-4753 made SP.counterWriteTask() return a LocalMutationRunnable instead of the usual DroppableRunnalbe, and LMR resubmits the original runnable in case of timing out instead of simply dropping it.
For counters this is not the right option since it would lead to overcounting if the mutation got dropped-then-resubmitted and then retried by the user.
