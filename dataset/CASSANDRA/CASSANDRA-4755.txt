Summary:
Bulk loader won't work with CQL3
Description:
Currently the bulk loader uses thrift to get the schema and validate it before bulk loading a cf. Since we stopped returning cql3 cfs through describe_keyspaces, the bulk loader will be unable to load those cfs.
If we figure out/add a way to validate the schema over jmx, we could use that for getting token ranges as well and drop thrift completely from the bulk loader.
Another option might be querying system tables manually to validate things.
