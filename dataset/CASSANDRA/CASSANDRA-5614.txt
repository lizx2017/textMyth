Summary:
W/O specified columns ASPCSI does not get notified of deletes
Description:
I'm working on a secondary index implementation based on the composite index type.
AbstractSimplePerColumnSecondaryIndex.java#delete is not called when CQL delete statements do not specify columns.
When I specify columns it is called. Pretty sure this is a bug.
Setup:
cqlsh> create KEYSPACE foo WITH replication = {'class': 'SimpleStrategy' , 'replication_factor': 1};
cqlsh> use foo;
cqlsh:foo> CREATE TABLE albums (artist text, album text, rating int, release int, PRIMARY KEY (artist, album));
cqlsh:foo> CREATE INDEX ON albums (rating);
cqlsh:foo> insert into albums (artist, album, rating, release) VALUES ('artist', 'album', 1, 2);
Does not get called here:
cqlsh:foo> DELETE FROM albums where artist='artist' and album='album';
cqlsh:foo> insert into albums (artist, album, rating, release) VALUES ('artist', 'album', 1, 2);
gets called here:
cqlsh:foo> DELETE rating FROM albums where artist='artist' and album='album';
