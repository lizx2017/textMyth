Summary:
OpenBitSet can allocate more bytes than it needs
Description:
CASSANDRA-2466 changed OpenBitSet to break big long arrays into pages. However, it always allocate full pages, each page being of size 4096 * 8 bytes. This means that we almost always allocate too much bytes, and for a row that has 1 column, the associated row bloom filter allocates 32760 more bytes than it should.
This has a significant impact on performance. In a small test using the SSTableSimpleUnsortedWriter to generate rows with 1 column, 0.8 is about twice as fast as 1.0 because of that (the difference shrink when there is more columns obviously).
