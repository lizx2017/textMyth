Summary:
Mark libjna-java + libjna-jni as incompatible in debian package
Description:
Current Debian (Wheezy) might bring libjna-java in version 3.2.7-4, which has incompatible libjnadispatch.so because since C* 2.1 we use JNA 4.0.0 (the native stuff changed):
jna.jar includes all binaries for all supported platforms - so there's no need for libjna installed separately.
Since CASSANDRA-8714 has been committed, the incompatibility manifests in java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Could not initialize class com.sun.jna.Native (which is caused by outdated libjna-java installed via apt).
Note: Debian jessie adds new package libjna-jni (4.1.0-1) in addition to libjna-java (4.1.0-1) - both contain the libjnidispatch.so. Although these seem to work, we might hit the same issue when there's a need to upgrade JNA to 4.2.x sometime.
