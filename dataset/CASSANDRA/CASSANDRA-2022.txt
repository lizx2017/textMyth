Summary:
Twisted driver for CQL
Description:
In-tree CQL drivers should be reasonably consistent with one another (wherever possible/practical), and implement a minimum of:
• Query compression
• Keyspace assignment on connection
• Connection pooling / load-balancing
The goal is not to supplant the idiomatic libraries, but to provide a consistent, stable base for them to build upon.
