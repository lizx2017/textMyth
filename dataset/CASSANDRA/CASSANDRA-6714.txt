Summary:
Fix replaying old (1.2) commitlog in Cassandra 2.0
Description:
Our docs, and code, both explicitly say that you should drain a node before upgrading to a new major release.
If you don't do what the docs explicitly tell you to do, however, Cassandra won't scream at you. Also, we do currently have logic to replay 1.2 commitlog in 2.0, but it seems to be slightly broken, unfortunately.
