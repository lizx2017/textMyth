Summary:
Prohibit Counter type as part of the PK
Description:
C* let me do this:
create table aggregated.counter1 ( a counter , b int , PRIMARY KEY (b,a)) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (a desc);
and then treated a as an int!
cqlsh> update aggregated.counter1 set a= a+1 where b = 2 ;Bad Request: Invalid operation (a = a + 1) for non counter column a
insert INTO aggregated.counter1 (b, a ) VALUES ( 3, 2) ;
(should have given can't insert must update error)
Even though desc table still shows it as a counter type:
CREATE TABLE counter1 (
  b int,
  a counter,
  PRIMARY KEY ((b), a)
) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (a DESC) AND
  bloom_filter_fp_chance=0.010000 AND
  caching='KEYS_ONLY' AND
  comment='' AND
  dclocal_read_repair_chance=0.100000 AND
  gc_grace_seconds=864000 AND
  index_interval=128 AND
  read_repair_chance=0.000000 AND
  replicate_on_write='true' AND
  populate_io_cache_on_flush='false' AND
  default_time_to_live=0 AND
  speculative_retry='99.0PERCENTILE' AND
  memtable_flush_period_in_ms=0 AND
  compaction={'class': 'SizeTieredCompactionStrategy'} AND
  compression={'sstable_compression': 'LZ4Compressor'};
