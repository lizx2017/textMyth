Summary:
Avoid serializing to byte[] on commitlog append
Description:
We used to avoid re-serializing RowMutations by caching the byte[] that we read off the wire. We don't do that anymore since we fixed MessagingService to not create intermediate byte[]. So we should serialize the mutation directly to the commitlog.
