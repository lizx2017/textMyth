Summary:
Streaming (2.0) can deadlock
Description:
The new streaming implementation (CASSANDRA-5286) creates 2 threads per host for streaming, one for the incoming stream and one for the outgoing one. However, both currently share the same socket, but since we use synchronous I/O, a read can block a write, which can result in a deadlock if 2 nodes are both blocking on a read a the same time, thus blocking their respective writes (this is actually fairly easy to reproduce with a simple repair).
So instead attaching a patch that uses one socket per thread.
The patch also correct the stream throughput throttling calculation that was 8000 times lower than what it should be.
