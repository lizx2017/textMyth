Summary:
parsing of chunk_length_kb silently overflows
Description:
Not likely to trigger for "real" values; I noticed because some other bug caused the chunk length setting to be corrupted somehow and take on some huge value having nothing to do with what I asked for in my schema update (not yet identified why; separate issue).
