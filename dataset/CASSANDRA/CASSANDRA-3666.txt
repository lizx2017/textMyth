Summary:
Changing compaction strategy from Leveled to SizeTiered logs millions of messages about nothing to compact
Description:
When column family compaction strategy is changed from Leveled to SizeTiered and there're Leveled compaction tasks pending, Cassandra starting to flood in logs with thousands per sec messages:

As a result, log disk is full and system is down.
