Summary:
stress skipKeys option does not appear to do anything
Description:
I don't see it used anywhere in the code. FWIW I thought when it worked the option was "start at key X" instead of "Fraction of keys to skip initially".
$ grep -rni skipkeys ./tools/stress/src/org/
./tools/stress/src/org/apache/cassandra/stress/Session.java:122:    private float skipKeys       = 0;
./tools/stress/src/org/apache/cassandra/stress/Session.java:199:                skipKeys = Float.parseFloat(cmd.getOptionValue("N"));
./tools/stress/src/org/apache/cassandra/stress/Session.java:513:    public float getSkipKeys()
./tools/stress/src/org/apache/cassandra/stress/Session.java:515:        return skipKeys;
