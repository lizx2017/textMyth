Summary:
IOException in MessagingService.run() causes orphaned storage server socket
Description:
The refactoring of reading the message header in MessagingService.run() vs IncomingTcpConnection seems to mishandle IOException as the loop is broken and MessagingService.SocketThread never seems to get reinitialized.
To reproduce: telnet to port 7000 and send random data. This then prevents any new or restarting node in the cluster from handshaking with this defunct storage port.
