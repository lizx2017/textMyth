Summary:
Importing sstables through sstableloader tombstoned data
Description:
We've tried to import sstables from a snapshot of a 1.2.10 cluster into a running 2.0.3 cluster. When using sstableloader, for some reason we couldn't retrieve some of the data. When investigating further, it turned out that tombstones in the far future were created for some rows. (sstable2json returned the correct data, but with an addition of "metadata": {"deletionInfo":
{"markedForDeleteAt":1796952039620607,"localDeletionTime":0}} to the rows that seemed missing).
This happened again exactly the same way when we cleared the new cluster and ran sstableloader again.
The sstables itself seemed fine, they were working on the old cluster, upgradesstables tells there's nothing to upgrade, and we were finally able to move our data correctly by copying the SSTables with scp into the right directory on the hosts of the new clusters worked fine (but naturally this required much more disk space than when sstableloader only sends the relevant parts).
