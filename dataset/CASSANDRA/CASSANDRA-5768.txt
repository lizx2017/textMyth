Summary:
If a Seed can't be contacted, a new node comes up as a cluster of 1
Description:
Setting up a new test cluster using 2.0.0-beta1 and I noticed the following behaviour with vnodes turned on.
I bring up one node all well and good. however if I bring up a second node, that can't contact the first (the first being the seed for the second) after a short period of time, the second goes ahead and assumes it's the only node and bootstraps with all tokens.

Obviously if you have defined a seed and cannot contact it, the node should not start as a cluster of one. I have a to-do list item to file a JIRA on the subject, but if you wanted to file and link us, that'd be super.
