Summary:
Cassandra-cli returns 'command not found' instead of syntax error
Description:
When creating a column family from the output of 'show schema' with an index, there is a trailing comma after "index_type: 0," The return from this is a 'command not found' This is misleading because the command is found, there is just a syntax error.
'Command not found: `create column family $cfname ...`
