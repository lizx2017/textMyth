Summary:
Don't try to build secondary indexes when there is none
Description:
buildSecondaryIndexes() is sometimes called without checking the cfs has secondary indexes. Has a result, it prints a useless message and will trigger a bunch of useless action (among which, a full scan of the indexed column family). This is not a huge problem in 0.8 because only the fairly new loadNewSSTables() call does this (which doesn't mean we should fix it). But in trunk, it does this after every streamIn session.
