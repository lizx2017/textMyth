Summary:
UDTs still visible after drop/recreate keyspace
Description:
When deploying my app from the scratch I run sequence - drop keyspaces, create keyspaces, create UDTs, create tables, generate lots of data... After few cycles, randomly, cassandra ends in state, where I cannot see anything in table system.schema_usertypes, when I select all rows, but queries with specified keyspace_name and type_name return old values. Usually it helps to restart C* and old data disapear, sometimes it needs to delete all C* data.
