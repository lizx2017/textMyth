Summary:
Nodes in DC2 die during and after huge write workload
Description:
Hello,
We have Cassandra 2.1.2 with 8 nodes, 4 in DC1 and 4 in DC2.
Node is VM 8 CPU, 32GB RAM
During significant workload (loading several millions blobs ~3.5MB each), 1 node in DC2 stops and after some time next 2 nodes in DC2 also stops.
Now, 2 of nodes in DC2 do not work and stops after 5-10 minutes after start. I see many files in system.hints table and error appears in 2-3 minutes after starting system.hints auto compaction.
Stops, means "ERROR [CompactionExecutor:1] 2015-04-01 23:33:44,456 CassandraDaemon.java:153 - Exception in thread Thread[CompactionExecutor:1,1,main]
java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space"
ERROR [HintedHandoff:1] 2015-04-01 23:33:44,456 CassandraDaemon.java:153 - Exception in thread Thread[HintedHandoff:1,1,main]
java.lang.RuntimeException: java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException: java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space
Full errors listing attached in cassandra_crash1.txt
The problem exists only in DC2. We have 1GbE between DC1 and DC2.
