Summary:
StreamSession selects canonical sstables, but uses the non-canonical instance
Description:
While implementing CASSANDRA-9699, I noticed that we are only checking that there is a canonical reader in StreamSession.getSSTablesForRanges, not that we are using the canonical instance. This means we are not using the full range of the sstable.
I'm not absolutely sure if this is a problem of correctness, as I'm not sufficiently versed in how incremental repair works, but it looks worrisome to me.
