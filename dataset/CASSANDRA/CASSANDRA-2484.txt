Summary:
CassandraStorage LoadPushDown implementation causes heisenbugs
Description:
After pulling hair out about why weird errors were happening loading data from cassandra with seemingly irrelevant changes to the pig scripts (mostly changing the script trying to debug other problems), it looks like the weird errors were because of the implementation we currently have for LoadPushDaown in CassandraStorage. Unless there is a good reason to implement it, I feel like we should just remove the few lines that are in there until we can spend some serious time doing an implementation of it.
