Summary:
Wrong cluster information and replication
Description:
Two machine cluster - Cassandra 2.1.2, GossipingPropertyFileSnitch, one data center with one rack.
Seed - 10.0.0.2
Node - 10.0.0.3
-start seed
-start node
Run "nodetool status" on any machine:
Datacenter: DC1
===============
Status=Up/Down
|/ State=Normal/Leaving/Joining/Moving
--  Address   Load       Tokens  Owns    Host ID                               Rack
UN  10.0.0.3  107.15 KB  256     ?       ad29cd96-d21e-4d02-94e7-0fd68ef5fbad  RAC1
UN  10.0.0.2  87.73 KB   256     ?       c26fdffc-6df5-4d1a-8eda-6d585d2178c1  RAC1
-stop both instances
-run seed
-run "nodetool status" on seed
Datacenter: DC1
===============
Status=Up/Down
|/ State=Normal/Leaving/Joining/Moving
--  Address   Load       Tokens  Owns    Host ID                               Rack
UN  10.0.0.2  113.31 KB  256     ?       c26fdffc-6df5-4d1a-8eda-6d585d2178c1  RAC1
So no information about node 10.0.0.3 at all.
Actually main problem is not wrong info, but replication/synchronization problem:
On seed (after restart, when 2nd node is down) create keyspace with replication factor 2 (strategy doesn't matter), create table, insert something into table:
CREATE KEYSPACE Excelsior WITH REPLICATION={'class':'SimpleStrategy','replication_factor':2};
CREATE TABLE Excelsior.users (name text PRIMARY KEY, id int);
INSERT INTO excelsior.users (name, id ) VALUES ( 'node',123);
SELECT * FROM excelsior.users;

 name | id
------+-----
 node | 123
(1 rows)
Start node, now "nodetool status" shows both nodes UN on both machines again.
Now created keyspace and table are seen on node (create was propagated from seed), but is empty from node point of view:
SELECT * FROM excelsior.users;
 name | id
------+----
(0 rows)
I guess synchronization problem probably not different bug, but stems from wrong cluster information.
Version 2.0.11 works fine.
