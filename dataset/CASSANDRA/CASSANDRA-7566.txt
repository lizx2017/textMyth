Summary:
DROP TABLE should also drop prepared statements associated to
Description:
An integration test suite that drops and creates the same column family 3 times causes the following error in the server log:
INFO 15:40:34 Initializing gocql_test.wiki_page
ERROR 15:40:34 Attempted to write commit log entry for unrecognized column family: b0e167e0-0dc8-11e4-9cbb-29a4872887f2

The test that reproduces this issue is here:
https://github.com/gocql/gocql/blob/master/wiki_test.go
Interestingly this issue only occurs after the common table is dropped/created for the 3rd time. If only one of the tests is run on its own, this issue does not arise.
