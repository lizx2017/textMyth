Summary:
Short read protection is broken
Description:
When a read needs to do more than one retry (due to short reads), the originalCount is not preserved by the retry leading to returning more than the requested number of columns.
Moreover, when a retried read checks whether more retry is needed, it doesn't compare the number of live column retrieved against the original number of columns requested by the user, but against the number of columns requested during the retry, making it much more likely to actually do one more retry.
This catch by the two tests 'short_read_test' and 'short_read_reversed_test' at https://github.com/riptano/cassandra-dtest/blob/master/consistency_test.py that are failing intermittently.
