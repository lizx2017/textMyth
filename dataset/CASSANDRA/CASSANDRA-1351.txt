Summary:
Avro Schema Swap
Description:
Due to misreading Avro's docs, I swapped the Schema parameters to Avro's schema resolver.
The schema resolver allows for backwards compatibility by accepting a writer's (ser.) and reader's (deser.) schema, and resolving them to determine which fields to add or ignore. The reader's schema was not being set correctly, which was breaking backwards compatibility (although not the disk format).
