Summary:
Always flush on TRUNCATE
Description:
Commit log grows infinitely after CF truncate operation via cassandra-cli, regardless CF receives writes or not thereafter.
CF's could be non-CQL Standard and Super column type. Creation of snapshots after truncate is turned off.
Commit log may start grow promptly, may start grow later, on a few only or on all nodes at once.
Nothing special in the system log. No idea how to reproduce.
After rolling restart commit logs are cleared and back to normal. Just annoying to do rolling restart after each truncate.
