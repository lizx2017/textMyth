Summary:
Memtable flushing should write any columns shadowed by partition/range tombstones if any 2i are present
Description:
We shouldn't be dropping any columns obsoleted by partition and/or range tombstones in case the table has secondary indexes, or else the stale entries wouldn't be cleaned up during compaction, and will only be dropped during 2i query read-repair, if that happens.
