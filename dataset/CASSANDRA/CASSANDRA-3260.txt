Summary:
MergeIterator assertion on sources != empty can be thrown
Description:
MergeIterator.get assert that it don't get an empty list of sources. This seems to at least not be the case in the unit test for some of tests (this don't make any test fail however, but there is a few stack trace thrown). I think it's pretty unnatural to "fail" on an empty list of sources and would force every caller to first take the empty case into account, so I propose to just remove that assertion.
