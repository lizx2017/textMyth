Summary:
IN on the last clustering columns + ORDER BY DESC yield no results
Description:
That's not a very common mix but well, the following return no results which is obviously bogus:
CREATE TABLE test (k int, c1 int, c2 int, PRIMARY KEY (k, c1, c2));
INSERT INTO test(k, c1, c2) VALUES (0, 0, 0);
INSERT INTO test(k, c1, c2) VALUES (0, 0, 1);
INSERT INTO test(k, c1, c2) VALUES (0, 0, 2);
SELECT * FROM test WHERE k=0 AND c1 = 0 AND c2 IN (2, 0) ORDER BY c1 DESC
Note: it's pretty useless to order on a column which has an equal restriction, and that's probably why nobody ran into this yet, but that's really just due to a minor typo so there is no reason not to fix.
