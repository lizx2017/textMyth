Summary:
Speculative read performance data show unexpected results
Description:
I've done a series of stress tests with eager retries enabled that show undesirable behavior. I'm grouping these behaviours into one ticket as they are most likely related.
1) Killing off a node in a 4 node cluster actually increases performance.
2) Compactions make nodes slow, even after the compaction is done.
3) Eager Reads tend to lessen the immediate performance impact of a node going down, but not consistently.
My Environment:
1 stress machine: node0
4 C* nodes: node4, node5, node6, node7
My script:
node0 writes some data: stress -d node4 -F 30000000 -n 30000000 -i 5 -l 2 -K 20
node0 reads some data: stress -d node4 -n 30000000 -o read -i 5 -K 20
Examples:
A node going down increases performance:
Data for this test here
At 450s, I kill -9 one of the nodes. There is a brief decrease in performance as the snitch adapts, but then it recovers... to even higher performance than before.
Compactions make nodes permanently slow:

The green and orange lines represent trials with eager retry enabled, they never recover their op-rate from before the compaction as the red and blue lines do.

Speculative Read tends to lessen the immediate impact:

This graph looked the most promising to me, the two trials with eager retry, the green and orange line, at 450s showed the smallest dip in performance.

But not always:

This is a retrial with the same settings as above, yet the 95percentile eager retry (red line) did poorly this time at 450s.
