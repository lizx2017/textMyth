Summary:
KeysIndex is broken by CASSANDRA-1600
Description:
CASSANDRA-1600 introduces bug which cause KeySearch throws an Exception during search
KeySearcher:163
logger.debug("Skipping {}", baseCfs.getComparator().getString(firstColumn.name()));
Here firstColumn is a column from index row, so column name is a key in the baseCf.
So the correct version would be:
logger.debug("Skipping {}", baseCfs.metadata.getKeyValidator().getString(firstColumn.name()));
Right now it is not possible to query KeysIndex.
