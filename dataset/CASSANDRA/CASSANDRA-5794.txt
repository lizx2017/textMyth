Summary:
BulkOutputFormat sometimes hangs when loading small SSTables
Description:
We have seen the bulk loader hang under some conditions. This only seems to occur when the last SSTable loaded is relatively small (1144 bytes in this case). Turning on debug logging shows the StreamInSession starting to stream a file, "en_oef_834_thrift-MessageData-ic-1-Data.db" below, and apparently getting a Thrift transport error. This loader was able to other files, some of them even smaller, without any problems.
The Thrift exception only appears in the debug logs, and apparently does not cause the stream session to fail. It just hangs the session on both the server and the client until the client is killed. When the client process is killed, the server then gets an unexpected EOF exception.
