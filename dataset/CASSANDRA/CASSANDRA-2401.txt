Summary:
getColumnFamily() return null, which is not checked in ColumnFamilyStore.java scan() method, causing Timeout Exception in query
Description:
ColumnFamilyStore.java, line near 1680, "ColumnFamily data = getColumnFamily(new QueryFilter(dk, path, firstFilter))", the data is returned null, causing NULL exception in "satisfies(data, clause, primary)" which is not captured. The callback got timeout and return a Timeout exception to Hector.
The data is empty, as I traced, I have the the columns Count as 0 in removeDeletedCF(), which return the null there. (I am new and trying to understand the logics around still). Instead of crash to NULL, could we bypass the data?
About my test:
A stress-test program to add, modify and delete data to keyspace. I have 30 threads simulate concurrent users to perform the actions above, and do a query to all rows periodically. I have Column Family with rows (as File) and columns as index (e.g. userID, fileType).
No issue on the first day of test, and stopped for 3 days. I restart the test on 4th day, 1 of the users failed to query the files (timeout exception received). Most of the users are still okay with the query.
