Summary:
Counters in columns don't preserve correct values after cluster restart
Description:
Similar to #3821. but affecting normal columns.
Set up a 2-node cluster with rf=2.
1. Create a counter column family and increment a 100 keys in loop 5000 times.
2. Then make a rolling restart to cluster.
3. Again increment another 5000 times.
4. Make a rolling restart to cluster.
5. Again increment another 5000 times.
6. Make a rolling restart to cluster.
After step 6 we were able to reproduce bug with bad counter values.
Expected values were 15 000. Values returned from cluster are higher then 15000 + some random number.
Rolling restarts are done with nodetool drain. Always waiting until second node discover its down then kill java process.
