Summary:
Table.flusherLock is static final.. remove static.
Description:
I see read and write latency spike when the system tables are flushing(according to opscentral)....
Only reason which i can come-up with is probably because of the Table.flusherLock is static final... i think it should not be static because the flush is per keyspace and this lock will lock all the read operations because one table is going through a flush.
