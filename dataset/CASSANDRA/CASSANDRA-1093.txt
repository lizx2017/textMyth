Summary:
BinaryMemtable interface silently dropping data.
Description:
I've been attempting to use the Binary Memtable (BMT) interface to load a large number of rows. During my testing, I discovered that on larger loads (~1 million rows), occasionally some of the data never appears in the database. This happens in a non-deterministic manner, as sometimes all the data loads fine, and other times a significant chunk goes missing. No errors are ever logged to indicate a problem. I'm attaching some sample code that approximates my application's usage of Cassandra and explains this bug in more detail.
