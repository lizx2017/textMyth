Summary:
Index selection during rebuild fails with certain table layouts.
Description:
The 2.0 patch for CASSANDRA-9196 introduces a bug which can cause index rebuild operations to fail, including those which run as part of streaming operations.
The issue is that SI#indexes actually expects a full cell name, rather than the CQL column name (so it's functionally the same as the 2.1 version). Passing a ColumnDefinition.name to certain implementations causes them to error, CompositesIndexOnRegular and KeysIndex}}s on tables with {{DynamicCompositeType columns for example.
The right thing is to do what the 2.1 version does and check the ColumnDefinition from the base table appears in SI#getColumnDefs. If we pull that check into SIM#filterByColumn then the SI#indexes(ColumnDefinition) overload from the original 2.1 patch is redundant.
