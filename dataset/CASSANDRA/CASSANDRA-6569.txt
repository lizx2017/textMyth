Summary:
Batchlog replays copy the entire batchlog table into the heap
Description:
The current batchlog replay path will read the entire batchlog table into the heap. This is pretty bad. This was compounded by CASSANDRA-5762, which caused the SELECT statement used by the batchlog replay to bring the entire row into memory instead of just the selected columns.
