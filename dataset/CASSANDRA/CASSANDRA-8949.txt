Summary:
CompressedSequentialWriter.resetAndTruncate can lose data
Description:
If the FileMark passed into this method fully fills the buffer, a subsequent call to write will reBuffer and drop the data currently in the buffer. We need to mark the buffer contents as dirty in resetAndTruncate to prevent this - see CASSANDRA-8709 notes for details.
