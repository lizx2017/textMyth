Summary:
DROP table leaves the counter and row cache in a temporarily inconsistent state that, if saved during, will cause an exception to be thrown
Description:
It looks like this is quite a realistic race to hit reasonably often, since we forceBlockingFlush after removing from Schema.cfIdMap, so there could be a lengthy window to overlap with an auto-save
