Summary:
On the CLI, creating or updating a keyspace to use the NetworkTopologyStrategy breaks "show keyspaces;"
Description:
To reproduce:
Start fresh.
Run "show keyspaces;"
Run "create keyspace Keyspace1 with placement_strategy='org.apache.cassandra.locator.NetworkTopologyStrategy';"
Run "show keyspaces;"
Note how before it showed the system keyspace. After it shows just:
Keyspace: Keyspace1:
Replication Strategy: org.apache.cassandra.locator.NetworkTopologyStrategy
null
If you have multiple keyspaces, it will hide those as well. Also, if you create the keyspace and then update it with NetworkTopologyStrategy, the same thing will happen.
