Summary:
now() is being rejected in INSERTs when inside collections
Description:
Lists, Sets and Maps reject NonTerminal terms in prepare:
    if (t instanceof Term.NonTerminal)
                    throw new InvalidRequestException(String.format("Invalid list literal for %s: bind variables are not supported inside collection literals", receiver));
and now() is instanceof NonTerminal since CASSANDRA-5616, hence
cqlsh:test> insert into demo (id, timeuuids) values (0, [now()]);
Bad Request: Invalid list literal for tus: bind variables are not supported inside collection literals
