Summary:
Don't include tmp files as sstable when create column families
Description:
When we open a column family and populate the SSTableReader, we happen to include -tmp files. This has no change to actually happen in a real life situation, but that is what was triggering a race in the unit tests triggering spurious assertion failure in estimateRowsFromIndex.
