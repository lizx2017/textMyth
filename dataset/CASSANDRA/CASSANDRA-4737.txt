doc/native_protocol.txt isn't up to date
Description:
CASSANDRA-4449 seems to have changed the datatype of the query id returned by a RESULT-PREPARED message from an int to a short n followed by n bytes (representing a md5sum). The specification at doc/native_protocol.txt doesn't cover this change yet.
