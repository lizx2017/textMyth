Summary:
example pig script doesn't run
Description:
The following line in the examples/pig/example-script.pig will not run (using Pig 0.9.2):
state_footage = FOREACH state_grouped GENERATE GROUP AS State, SUM(state_flat.SquareFeet) AS TotalFeet:int;
It needs to have a lowercase 'group' because that's the variable name after doing the GROUP operation in the previous line:
state_footage = FOREACH state_grouped GENERATE group AS State, SUM(state_flat.SquareFeet) AS TotalFeet:int;
Also, I wonder if it would be good to separate the CassandraStorage and CqlStorage into two different scripts, just so you can run the CqlStorage example out of the box without having to comment out the CassandraStorage example.
