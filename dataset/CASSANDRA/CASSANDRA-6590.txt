Summary:
Gossip does not heal after a temporary partition at startup
Description:
See CASSANDRA-6571 for background. If a node is partitioned on startup when the echo command is sent, but then the partition heals, the halves of the partition will never mark each other up despite being able to communicate. This stems from CASSANDRA-3533.
