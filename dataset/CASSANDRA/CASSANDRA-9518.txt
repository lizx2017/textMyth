Summary:
Assassinate should work even if the endpoint state isn't present
Description:
Similar to CASSANDRA-6787, if the endpointStateMap.get(endpoint) call returns null, we should make one up and continue along with the assassination, since this could still be the endpoint 'bouncing around in gossip' and that makes it tricky to assassinate.
