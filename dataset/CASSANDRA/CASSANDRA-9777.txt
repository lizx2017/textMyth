Summary:
If you have a ~/.cqlshrc and a ~/.cassandra/cqlshrc, cqlsh will overwrite the latter with the former
Description:
If you have a .cqlshrc file, and a ~/.cassandra/cqlshrc file, when you run `cqlsh`, it will overwrite the latter with the former. https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/trunk/bin/cqlsh#L202
If the 'new' path exists (~/.cassandra/cqlsh), cqlsh should either WARN or just leave the files alone.
