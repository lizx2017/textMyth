Summary:
Cassandra2.1~beta1 Stall at Boot
Description:
I was trying out the new release for several perf. improvements that I am very interested in. After upgrading my cassandra from 2.0.5 to the beta version, cassandra is stalled while init the column families.
I might misconfigure something, but it seems it is suck in a loop. I added a couple debug statements, but, on second thought, I think I should just leave it to the experts...
It's looping in the following over and over:
src/java/org/apache/cassandra/utils/memory/Pool.java#needsCleaning
0 >= -858993472 && true && true

They may be totally unrelated or a normal behavior. Let me know if there is any other info I should provide.
