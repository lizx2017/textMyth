Summary:
CQL: double and float types do not seem to work properly
Description:
Was asked to make this from the mailing list by Jonathan Ellis.
I'm just getting started with CQL, and decided to do a simple test create/insert/select thing to check that everything was working. Most everything seems to work, but it appears that double/floats do not work properly. Here's what I did:
test.cql
--------------------------
CREATE KEYSPACE test with strategy_class = 'SimpleStrategy' and strategy_options:replication_factor=1;
USE test;
CREATE COLUMNFAMILY testvals (
key varchar PRIMARY KEY,
value float
);
INSERT INTO testvals (key,value) VALUES ('k1',341.32355);
SELECT key, value FROM testvals;
--------------------------
The output is this:
cqlsh localhost < scripts/test.cql
key | value |
k1 | @uU-B??? |
Same thing happens when I do value double. I also tried to do this from the python driver, gives the same weirdness:
In [2]: import cql
In [3]: con = cql.connect("localhost",keyspace="test")
In [4]: cursor = con.cursor()
In [5]: cursor.execute("SELECT * from testvals")
Out[5]: True
In [6]: for r in cursor: print r
...:
[u'k1', '?\xf8\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00']
