Summary:
ViewTest.sstableInBounds is failing
Description:
CASSANDRA-8568 introduced new tests to cover what was DataTracker functionality in 2.1, and is now covered by the lifecycle package. This particular test indicates this method does not fulfil the expected contract, namely that more sstables are returned than should be.
However while looking into it I noticed it also likely has a bug (which I have not updated the test to cover) wherein a wrapped range will only yield the portion at the end of the token range, not the beginning. It looks like we may have call sites using this function that do not realise this, so it could be a serious bug, especially for repair.
