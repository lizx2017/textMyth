Summary:
The configuration for remote debugging is not valid anymore.
Description:
The current configuration for remote debugging that we use is:
# JVM_OPTS="$JVM_OPTS -Xdebug -Xnoagent -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=1414"
Since java 1.5 it should be:
JVM_OPTS="$JVM_OPTS -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=1414"
