Summary:
RPM spec file should create saved_caches directory
Description:
After installing the 0.6.6 RPM from rpm.riptano.com, the directories /var/lib/cassandra/data and /var/lib/cassandra/commitlog exist, but /var/lib/cassandra saved_caches does not exist. Cassandra fails to startup with "java.io.IOException: unable to mkdirs /var/lib/cassandra/saved_caches".
After manually creating /var/lib/cassandra/saved_caches, Cassandra can start.
