Summary:
Hinted handoffs isn't delivered if/when HintedHandOffManager ends up in invalid state.
Description:
Running Cassandra 1.0.3.
I've done some testing with 2 nodes (node A, node B), replication factor 2.
I take node A down, writing some data to node B and then take node A up.
Sometimes hints aren't delivered when node A comes up.
I've done some debugging in org.apache.cassandra.db.HintedHandOffManager and sometimes node B ends up in a strange state in method org.apache.cassandra.db.HintedHandOffManager.deliverHints(final InetAddress to), where org.apache.cassandra.db.HintedHandOffManager.queuedDeliveries already has node A in it's Set and therefore no hints will ever be delivered to node A.
The only reason for this that I can see is that in org.apache.cassandra.db.HintedHandOffManager.deliverHintsToEndpoint(InetAddress endpoint) the hintStore.isEmpty() check returns true and the endpoint (node A) isn't removed from org.apache.cassandra.db.HintedHandOffManager.queuedDeliveries. Then no hints will ever be delivered again until node B is restarted.
During what conditions will hintStore.isEmpty() return true?
Shouldn't the hintStore.isEmpty() check be inside the try {} finally{} clause, removing the endpoint from queuedDeliveries in the finally block?
public void deliverHints(final InetAddress to)
{
    logger_.debug("deliverHints to {}", to);
    if (!queuedDeliveries.add(to))
        return;
    .......
}
private void deliverHintsToEndpoint(InetAddress endpoint) 
    throws IOException, DigestMismatchException, InvalidRequestException, TimeoutException, InterruptedException
{
     ColumnFamilyStore hintStore = Table.open(Table.SYSTEM_TABLE).getColumnFamilyStore(HINTS_CF);
     if (hintStore.isEmpty())
         return; // nothing to do, don't confuse users by logging a no-op handoff
     try
     {
         ......
     }
     finally
     {
         queuedDeliveries.remove(endpoint);
     }
}
