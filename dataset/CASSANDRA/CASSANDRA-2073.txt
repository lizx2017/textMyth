Summary:
Streaming occasionally makes gossip back up
Description:
Streaming occasionally makes gossip back up, causing nodes to mark each other as down even though the network is ok. This appears to happen just after streaming has finished. I noticed this in the course of working on CASSANDRA-2072, so decommission is one way to reproduce. It seems to happen maybe one of fifteen or twenty tries, so it's fairly rare.
