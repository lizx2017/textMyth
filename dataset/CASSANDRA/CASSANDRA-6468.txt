Summary:
Runaway thread for SSL socket
Description:
Start Cassandra with internode_encryption turned on. For example server_encryption_options: internode_encryption: dc
Open a telnet session to port 7001. Don't type anything. I used PuTTY in a RAW mode
Shutdown the MessageService (for ex. by calling drain on StorageSevice MBean )
Now type anything in the telnet session and press enter
Observe an endless flood of "Error reading the socket null. java.net.SocketException: Socket closed"
