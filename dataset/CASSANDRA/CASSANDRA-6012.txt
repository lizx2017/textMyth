Summary:
CAS does not always correctly replay inProgress rounds
Description:
Paxos says that on receiving the result of a prepare from a quorum of acceptors, the proposer should propose the value of the higher-number proposal accepted amongst the ones returned by the acceptors, and only propose his own value if no acceptor has send us back a previously accepted value.
But in PrepareCallback we only keep the more recent inProgress commit regardless of whether is has an update. Which means we could ignore a value already accepted by some acceptors if any of the acceptor send us a more recent ballot than the other acceptor but with no values. The net effect is that we can mistakenly accept two different values for the same round.
