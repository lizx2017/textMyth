Summary:
memtable_total_space_in_mb does not accept the value 0 in Cassandra 1.0
Description:
This affects 1.0 beta1.
From the key explanation in cassandra.yaml it looks like it should accept the value "0"
Total memory to use for memtables. Cassandra will flush the largest
memtable when this much memory is used.
If omitted, Cassandra will set it to 1/3 of the heap.
If set to 0, only the old flush thresholds are used.
memtable_total_space_in_mb: 0
However in the code I could see the following:
if (conf.memtable_total_space_in_mb <= 0)
throw new ConfigurationException("memtable_total_space_in_mb must be positive");
logger.info("Global memtable threshold is enabled at {}MB", conf.memtable_total_space_in_mb);
