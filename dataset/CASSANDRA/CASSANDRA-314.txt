Summary:
Return standard/super designation to introspection and fix typo in DD
Description:
As reported by Evan in IRC, DatabaseDescriptor is using "ColumnIMESTAMP" instead of "COLUMN_TIMESTAMP", and there is now no way to introspect for super-ness. Type used to show Standard or Super but now shows the comparator type.
