Summary:
Possible NPE on EACH_QUORUM writes
Description:
When upgrading from 1.0 to 1.1, we observed that DatacenterSyncWriteResponseHandler.assureSufficientLiveNodes() can throw an NPE if one of the writeEndpoints has a DC that is not listed in the keyspace while one of the nodes is down. We observed this while running in EC2, and using the Ec2Snitch. The exception typically was was brief, but a certain segment of writes (using EACH_QUORUM) failed during that time.
This ticket will address the NPE in DSWRH, while a followup ticket will be created once we get to the bottom of the incorrect DC being reported from Ec2Snitch.
