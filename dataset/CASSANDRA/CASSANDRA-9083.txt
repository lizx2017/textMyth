Summary:
cqlsh COPY functionality doesn't work together with SOURCE or with cqlsh -f
Description:
Executing a COPY command from an external file using the cqlsh -f or the SOURCE command results in the error:
filename.cql:7:descriptor 'lower' requires a 'str' object but received a 'unicode'
Looks like there was a change in the cqlsh code from 2.1.2 to 2.1.3 which makes use of codecs.open() instead of open(), which returns a unicode object.
The offending line of code that returns the error seems to be in cqlsh, line 1415:
copyoptnames = map(str.lower, parsed.get_binding('optnames', ()))
