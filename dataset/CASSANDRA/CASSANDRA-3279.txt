Summary:
System.gc() useless after the move to reference-counting based compaction??
Description:
this:
https://github.com/apache/cassandra/commit/f30ca092fc96ea0e50d0a3301bd2e848c143ca5b#diff-4
adds an explicit System.gc()
to "force unmap of compacted SSTables so they can be deleted".
according to my limited understanding of the old sstable compaction code, it was somehow related to the usage of weak references.
now that we don't use weak/phantom references , should this be removed ??
---- although the original JIRA made efforts to reduce the frequency this is called, I still do see some of it, and the result is quite serious (14 seconds pause)
