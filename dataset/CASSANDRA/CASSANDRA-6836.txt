Summary:
WriteTimeoutException always reports that the serial CL is "SERIAL"
Description:
In StorageProxy.proposePaxos, the WriteTimeoutException is thrown with information about the consistency level. This CL is hardcoded to ConsistencyLevel.SERIAL, which might be wrong when LOCAL_SERIAL is used:
        if (timeoutIfPartial && !callback.isFullyRefused())
            throw new WriteTimeoutException(WriteType.CAS, ConsistencyLevel.SERIAL, callback.getAcceptCount(), requiredParticipants);
Suggested fix: pass consistencyForPaxos as a parameter to proposePaxos().
