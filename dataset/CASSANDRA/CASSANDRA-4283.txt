Summary:
CQL3: dates are not handled correctly in slices
Description:
Our timestamp type allows to input timestamp as dates like '2012-06-06'. However, those don't work as expected in slice queries, as for instance:
SELECT * FROM timeline
  WHERE k = ...
  AND time > '2012-06-06'
  AND time <= '2012-06-09'
will return timestamps from '2012-06-06' and not those from '2012-06-09'. The reason being of course that we always translate a date the same way, using 0 for whichever part is not precised.
A reasonably simple fix could be to add a new fromString(String s, boolean gt) method to AbstractType that is used when the the string should be interpreted in an inequality (the boolean gt would then say which kind of inequality).
