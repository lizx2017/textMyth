Summary:
'nodetool repair -pr' leads to indefinitely hanging AntiEntropySession
Description:
Running nodetool repair -pr will sometimes hang on one of the resulting AntiEntropySessions.
The system logs will show the repair command starting
 INFO [Thread-3079] 2014-07-15 02:22:56,514 StorageService.java (line 2569) Starting repair command #1, repairing 256 ranges for keyspace x
You can then see a few AntiEntropySessions completing with:
INFO [AntiEntropySessions:2] 2014-07-15 02:28:12,766 RepairSession.java (line 282) [repair #eefb3c30-0bc6-11e4-83f7-a378978d0c49] session completed successfully
Finally we reach an AntiEntropySession at some point that hangs just before requesting the merkle trees for the next column family in line for repair. So we first see the previous CF being finished and the whole repair sessions hangs here with no visible progress or errors on this or any of the related nodes.

Notes:
Single DC 6 node cluster with an average load of 86 GB per node.
This appears to be random; it does not always happen on the same CF or on the same session.
