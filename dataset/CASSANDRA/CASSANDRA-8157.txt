Summary:
Opening results early with leveled compactions broken
Description:
CASSANDRA-8034 notifies the listeners whenever we replace an sstable to make sure we have track the right instance.
Problem is though that when we open early and finish a compaction, we try to re-add the same sstable to the manifest which drops it to level 0 since it overlaps with the one that is already there
