Summary:
make jmx count/latency stuff actually useful
Description:
i just track those since "the beginning of time" it is not very useful for monitoring.
(say things are fine for days, then something breaks â€“ you have to overcome the days of fine-ness in the avg before you can see anything wrong.)
option 1: reset the counters after each request for data. problem: then i can't have multiple collectors (which i don't need atm but might be nice to have).
option 2: keep the last N data points and compute an average on demand, but that's more complicated than just doing a += for each op.
going to go with option 2.
