Summary:
Uncaught exceptions in CLI can produce obtuse "null" error message
Description:
CliMain#processStatementInteractive method relies on the getMessage method of Exception. This method can return null per JavaDocs on Exception hierarchy.
Checking for null and dumping the exception class would be more useful, particularly to new users reporting problems.
