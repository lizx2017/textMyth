Summary:
StorageProxy throws NPEs for when there's no hostids for a target
Description:
On trunk...
if there is no host id due to an old node, an info log is generated, but the code continues to use the null host id causing NPEs in decompose... Should this bypass this code, or perhaps can the plain ip address be used in this case? don't know.
as follows...
UUID hostId = StorageService.instance.getTokenMetadata().getHostId(target);
if ((hostId == null) && (Gossiper.instance.getVersion(target) < MessagingService.VERSION_12))
logger.info("Unable to store hint for host with missing ID, {} (old node?)", target.toString());
RowMutation hintedMutation = RowMutation.hintFor(mutation, ByteBuffer.wrap(UUIDGen.decompose(hostId)));
hintedMutation.apply();
