Summary:
RowCache misses Updates
Description:
While performing stress tests to find any race problems for CASSANDRA-2864 I guess I (re-)found one for the standard on-heap row cache.
During my stress test I hava lots of threads running with some of them only reading other writing and re-reading the value.
This seems to happen:
Reader tries to read row A for the first time doing a getTopLevelColumns
Row A which is not in the cache yet is updated by Writer. The row is not eagerly read during write (because we want fast writes) so the writer cannot perform a cache update
Reader puts the row in the cache which is now missing the update
I already asked this some time ago on the mailing list but unfortunately didn't dig after I got no answer since I assumed that I just missed something. In a way I still do but haven't found any locking mechanism that makes sure that this should not happen.
The problem can be reproduced with every run of my stress test. When I restart the server the expected column is there. It's just missing from the cache.
To test I have created a patch that merges memtables with the row cache. With the patch the problem is gone.
I can also reproduce in 0.8. Haven't checked 1.1 but I haven't found any relevant change their either so I assume the same aplies there.
