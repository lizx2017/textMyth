Summary:
User rpc_address for binary protocol and change default port
Description:
The events mechanism of the binary protocol require that we know the address on which other nodes can be joined (for the binary protocol). Hence CASSANDRA-4501. However, in 1.2 we've already burned all the padding in 1.1 gossip, so we can't gossip a new info (the binary protocol address), so CASSANDRA-4501 will have to move to 1.3.
But we do already gossip the rpc_address value, so an option is to make the binary protocol bind on the rpc_address (but a specific port) rather than having it's own setting. This ticket suggests to do that. Imo, there is little downside to do it: the thrift and binary transport are not meant to be used together except during the transition from one to the other, and even then having to use the same network interface is hardly a limitation (in other words, even for 1.3, we might want to hold on CASSANDRA-4501 until someone comes with a compelling use case for it).
