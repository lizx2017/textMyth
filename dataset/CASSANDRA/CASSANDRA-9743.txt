Summary:
Fix merging of rows in PartitionUpdate
Description:
Something's not right with RowUpdateBuilder when adding map or list entries. It breaks SELECT queries that follow afterwards, inflating the resultset, and duplicating the rows multiple times.
It manifests when a table has more than one collection, and we update them both with more than one item.
Here is a gist with minimal reproducible code: https://gist.github.com/iamaleksey/b6e9476fece029067729
The bug is currently blocking CASSANDRA-6717 code for migration from old schema keyspace to a new one.
P.S. I'm assuming that the bug is in RowUpdateBuilder because I couldn't reproduce in cqlsh. Could be that something's broken in the iterators, but trying to debug a cascade of them failed me.
