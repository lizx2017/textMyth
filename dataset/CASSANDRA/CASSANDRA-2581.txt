Summary:
Rebuffer called excessively during seeks
Description:
When doing an strace tonight, I noticed during memtable flushes that we were only writing 1KB per every write() system call...After diving more into it, it's because of a bug in the seek() code.
if (newPosition >= bufferOffset + validBufferBytes || newPosition < bufferOffset)
vs.
if (newPosition > (bufferOffset + validBufferBytes) || newPosition < bufferOffset)
Two things I noticed, we shouldn't need to rebuffer if newPosition is equal to bufferOffset + validBufferBytes, second the evaluation was doing (newPosition >= bufferOffset) + validBufferBytes which always seemed to be true.
