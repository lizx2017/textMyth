Summary:
'null' error when running sstablesplit on valid sstable
Description:
ccm create --cassandra-version git:cassandra-2.0 test
ccm populate -n 1
ccm start
ccm node1 stress -n 10000000 -o insert
ccm node1 compact
cd ~/.ccm/test/node1/data
../bin/sstablesplit -s 100 ./Keyspace1/Standard1/Keyspace1-Standard1-jb-12-Data.db
Expected: single sstable should be split into multiple sstables
Got:
Pre-split sstables snapshotted into snapshot pre-split-1379088385051
Error splitting SSTableReader(path='./Keyspace1/Standard1/Keyspace1-Standard1-jb-12-Data.db'): null
running du -h on the large compacted sstable showed it to be 2.4GB
This is probably related to CASSANDRA-6026; however, it is different. In this bug the split does not occur, whereas in 6026 the split does occur though an error is thrown.
