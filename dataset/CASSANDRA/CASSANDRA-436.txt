Summary:
OOM during major compaction on many (hundreds) of sstables
Description:
compaction deserializes rows during compaction before they are needed, one per sstable. if we only deserialized on-demand the current algorithm would be fine on nearly arbitrarily large numbers of sstables. (this is only important b/c it is useful to disable compactions during bulk load.)
