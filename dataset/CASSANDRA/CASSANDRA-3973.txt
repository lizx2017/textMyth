Summary:
Pig CounterColumnFamily support
Description:
Included a patch to the current test script to demonstrate that CassandraStorage does not support counter columns, as well as a patch to fix the issue.
The core reason is that CassandraStorage assumes that counters can be unpacked using CounterColumnType, when in fact the column value is already a Long.
