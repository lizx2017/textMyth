Summary:
pig contrib module not building, other errors
Description:
Currently, the pig contrib module fails to build because of dependency issues - it looks like dependencies like hadoop that were at one time in the main cassandra dependency list.
Also, once the dependencies are resolved, there are still errors when running the example pig query in the README.txt in the module.
This ticket would address both of those issues and getting it working both on 0.6.x as well as mainline trunk.
