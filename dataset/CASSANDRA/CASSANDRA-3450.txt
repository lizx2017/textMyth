Summary:
maybeInit in ColumnFamilyRecordReader can cause rows to be empty but not null
Description:
1) In ColumnFamilyRecordReader isPredicateEmpty needs bracing to correctly place the else if to the properly controlling if.
1a) isPredicateEmpty should use an || in the getSlice_range predicate rather than &&.
2) In ColumnFamilyRecordReader computeNext() calls maybeInit() and then if ros is not null it is indexed into. maybeInit() could fetch new data, determine the associated slice predicate is empty, and end up removing all the rows if all columns turned out to be empty. There is no check for rows.isEmpty() after the possible removal of all rows.
