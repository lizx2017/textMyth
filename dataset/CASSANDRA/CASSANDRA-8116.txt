Summary:
HSHA fails with default rpc_max_threads setting
Description:
The HSHA server fails with 'Out of heap space' error if the rpc_max_threads is left at its default setting (unlimited) in cassandra.yaml.
I'm not proposing any code change for this but have submitted a patch for a comment change in cassandra.yaml to indicate that rpc_max_threads needs to be changed if you use HSHA.
