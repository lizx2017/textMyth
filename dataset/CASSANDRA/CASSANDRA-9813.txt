Summary:
cqlsh column header can be incorrect when no rows are returned
Description:
Upon migration, we internally create a pair of surrogate clustering/regular columns for compact static tables. These shouldn't be exposed to the user.
That is, for the table
CREATE TABLE bar (k int, c int, PRIMARY KEY (k)) WITH COMPACT STORAGE;
SELECT * FROM bar should not be returning this result set:
cqlsh:test> select * from bar;

 c | column1 | k | value
---+---------+---+-------

(0 rows)
Should only contain the defined c and k columns.
