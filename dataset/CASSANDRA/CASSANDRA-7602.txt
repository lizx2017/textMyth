Summary:
During rolling upgrade to 1.2 some counters are not found
Description:
The cassandra dtest for upgrading with RandomPartitioner is showing a potential issue with counters during a mixed-version upgrade.
The test starts with a 3 node cluster on 1.1 (RF=2).
In turn, the following is performed on each node:
node gets 25k counter updates distributed across 100 counter cells. (CL=all)
node is drained and shutdown
node is updated to 1.2, started up, and upgradesstables is run
counter values are checked again (CL=one)
The steps above succeed for the first node, but fail on the second node. The failure isn't because the counters are wrong â€“ they don't seem to be present at all.
I tried adding an additional flush before the drain, and this actually seems to have increased the number of counters not found.
To run the test with dtest/nose:
set PRINT_DEBUG=true
then run nosetests -vs upgrade_through_versions_test:TestRandomPartitionerUpgrade.upgrade_test_mixed
