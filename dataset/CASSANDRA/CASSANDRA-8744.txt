Summary:
Ensure SSTableReader.first/last are honoured universally
Description:
Split out from CASSANDRA-8683; we don't honour the first/last properties of an sstablereader, and we tend to assume that we do. This can cause problems in LCS validation compactions, for instance, where a scanner is assumed to only cover the defined range, but may return data either side of that range. In general it is only wasteful to not honour these ranges anyway.
