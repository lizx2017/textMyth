Summary:
Stream sessions can only fail via the FailureDetector
Description:
If for some reason, FileStreamTask itself fails more than the number of retry attempts but gossip continues to work, the stream session will never be closed. This is unlikely to happen in practice since it requires blocking the storage port from new connections but keeping the existing ones, however for the bulk loader this is especially problematic since it doesn't have access to a failure detector and thus no way of knowing if a session failed.
