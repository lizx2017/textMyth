Summary:
Unnecessary required filtering for query on indexed clustering key
Description:
Let's create and populate a simple table composed of one partition key a, two clustering keys b & c, and one secondary index on a standard column e:
$ cqlsh 127.0.0.1
Connected to test21 at 127.0.0.1:9160.
[cqlsh 4.1.1 | Cassandra 2.1.6-SNAPSHOT | CQL spec 3.1.1 | Thrift protocol 19.39.0]
Use HELP for help.
cqlsh> CREATE KEYSPACE test WITH REPLICATION={'class': 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor': 3};
cqlsh> CREATE TABLE test.table1 (
   ...     a int,
   ...     b int,
   ...     c int,
   ...     d int,
   ...     e int,
   ...     PRIMARY KEY (a, b, c)
   ... );
cqlsh> CREATE INDEX table1_e ON test.table1 (e);
cqlsh> INSERT INTO test.table1 (a, b, c, d, e) VALUES (1, 1, 1, 1, 1);
(...)
cqlsh> SELECT * FROM test.table1;

 a | b | c | d | e
---+---+---+---+---
 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1
 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2
 1 | 1 | 3 | 3 | 3
 1 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 3
 1 | 3 | 1 | 1 | 1
 2 | 4 | 1 | 1 | 1

(6 rows)
With such a schema, I am allowed to query on the indexed column without filtering by providing the first two elements of the primary key:
cqlsh> SELECT * FROM test.table1 WHERE a=1 AND b=1 AND e=3;

 a | b | c | d | e
---+---+---+---+---
 1 | 1 | 3 | 3 | 3

(1 rows)
Let's now introduce an index on the first clustering key:
cqlsh> CREATE INDEX table1_b ON test.table1 (b);
Now, I expect the same query as above to work without filtering, but it's not:
cqlsh> SELECT * FROM test.table1 WHERE a=1 AND b=1 AND e=3;
Bad Request: Cannot execute this query as it might involve data filtering and thus may have unpredictable performance. If you want to execute this query despite the performance unpredictability, use ALLOW FILTERING
I think this is a bug on the way secondary indexes are accounted for when checking for unfiltered queries.
