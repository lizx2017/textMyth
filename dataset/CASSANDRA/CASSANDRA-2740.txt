Summary:
nodetool decommission should throw an error when there are extra params
Description:
removetoken takes a token parameter, but decommission works against the node where the call is issued. This allows confusion such as 'nodetool -h localhost decommission <ip or token>' actually decommissioning the local node, instead of whatever was passed to it.
