Summary:
cqlsh describe tables doesn't work
Description:
describe tables fails with "list[i] not a string for i in 0"
describe keyspace fails by only returning the keyspace and not the cfs
steps to setup:
create keyspace foo with replication =
{'class':'NetworkTopologyStrategy', 'datacenter1':1}
;
create table bar (userid int primary key, firstname text, lastname text);
use foo;
I'd suggest that this is important to fix for B3 to encourage testers.
