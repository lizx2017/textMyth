Summary:
Replace token leaves the old node state in tact causing problems in cli
Description:
in the replace token patch we dont evict the node from the Gossip which will leave the node lingering around and causes issues in cli (UNReachable nodes)
As a part of the replace token if the token is replaced with another token we should remove the old nodes Gossip states.
