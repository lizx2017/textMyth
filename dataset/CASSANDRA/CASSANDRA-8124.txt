Summary:
Stopping a node during compaction can make already written files stay around
Description:
In leveled compaction we generally create many files during compaction, in 2.0 we left the ones we had written as tmp files, in 2.1 we close and open the readers, removing the tmp markers.
This means that any ongoing compactions will leave the resulting files around if we restart. Note that stop:ing the compaction will cause an exception and that makes us call abort() on the SSTableRewriter which removes the files.
Guess a fix could be to keep the tmp marker and make tmplink files until we are actually done with the compaction.
