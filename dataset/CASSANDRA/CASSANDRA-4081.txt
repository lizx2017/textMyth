Summary:
Issue with cassandra-cli "assume" command and custom types
Description:
There seems to be an issue with cassandra-cli's assume command with a custom type. I get "Syntax error at position 35: missing EOF at '.'"
To make sure the issue is not with my custom type, I tried it with the built-in BytesType and got the same error:
[default@test] assume UserDetails validator as org.apache.cassandra.db.marshal.BytesType;
Syntax error at position 35: missing EOF at '.'
I also tried it with single and double quotes with no success:
[default@test] assume UserDetails validator as 'org.apache.cassandra.db.marshal.BytesType';
Syntax error at position 32: mismatched input ''org.apache.cassandra.db.marshal.BytesType'' expecting Identifier
Based on the output of "help assume" I should be able to just pass a fqn of a class.
> It is also valid to specify the fully-qualified class name to a class that
> extends org.apache.Cassandra.db.marshal.AbstractType.
