Summary:
streaming from all (not one) neighbors during rebuild/bootstrap
Description:
The last round of changes that happened in CASSANDRA-3483 before it went in actually changed behavior - we now stream from ALL neighbors that have a range, rather than just one. This leads to data size explosion.
Attaching patch to revert to intended behavior.
