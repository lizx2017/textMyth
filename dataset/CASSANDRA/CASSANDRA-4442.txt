Summary:
Stack size settings in cassandra-env.sh assume 64-bit x86
Description:
The fix for CASSANDRA-4275 hard-codes a 160 KB stack size when using Java 7 on Linux. This assumes the Oracle 7u4 JVM on 64-bit x86. For systems like 32-bit ARM, this size is excessive (the minimum for 7u4 on ARM is 60-64 KB). Also, the minimum allowed value is version-dependent and is calculated dynamically by the JVM on startup based on Linux parameters that can also change. A better approach would be to query the JVM for the minimum stack size.
