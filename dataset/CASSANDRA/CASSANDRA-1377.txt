Summary:
NPE aborts streaming operations for keyspaces with hyphens ('-') in their names
Description:
When streaming starts for operations such as repair or bootstrap, it will fail due to an NPE if they rows are in a keyspace that has a hyphen in its name. One workaround for this issue would be to not use keyspace names containing hyphens. It would be even nicer if streaming worked for keyspace names with hyphens, since keyspaces named like that seem to be fine in all other ways.
To reproduce:
1. With a multi-node ring, load up a keyspace with a hyphen in its name
2. Add some data to that keyspace
3. nodetool repair
Expected results:
Repair operations complete normally
Actual results:
Repair operations don't complete normally. The stacktrace below is correlated with the repair request.
