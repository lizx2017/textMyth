Summary:
MoveTest madness
Description:
I encountered what looks like bugs in o.a.c.service.MoveTest.newTestWriteEndpointsDuringMove() while doing something else; Here is a (poorly researched )ticket before I forget
There are two loops over non-system tables, and the first is a NOOP
In the second loop, a set exactly replicationFactor in size is compared against tmd.getWriteEndpoints(), which should produce greater than replicationFactor endpoints during a move (shouldn't it?); How does this pass?
