Summary:
update gc options for debian package
Description:
/etc/default/cassandra needs the new jvm options from cassandra.in.sh
also, it looks like heap size is also set-able in the init.d script, but it was ignored in favor of the values from /etc/default/cassandra, it would be less confusing to leave those out of the init.d script
