Summary:
Using a Cassandra 2.0 seed doesn't allow a new Cassandra 2.1 node to bootstrap
Description:
If you spin up a Cassandra 2.0 cluster with some seeds, and then attempt to attach a Cassandra 2.1 node to it, you get the following message:
OutboundTcpConnection.java:429 - Handshaking version with /10.24.0.10
Turning on debug, you get a few additional messages:
DEBUG [WRITE-/(ip)] MessagingService.java:789 - Setting version 7 for /10.24.0.10
DEBUG [WRITE-/(ip)] OutboundTcpConnection.java:369 - Target max version is 7; will reconnect with that version
However, the code never reconnects. See the comments as to why.
