Summary:
While dropping and recreating an index, incremental snapshotting can hang
Description:
When creating a hard link (at list with JNA), link() hang if the target of the
link already exists. In theory though, we should not hit that situation
because we use a new directory for each manual snapshot and the generation
number of the sstables should prevent this from hapenning with increment
snapshot.
However, when you drop, then recreate a secondary index, if the sstables are
deleted after the drop and before we recreate the index, the recreated index
sstables will start with a generation to 0. Thus, when we start backuping them
incrementally, it will conflict with the sstables of the previously dropped
index.
First, we should check for the target existance because calling link() to at
least avoid hanging. But then we must make sure that when we drop, then
recreate an index, we will either not name the sstables the same way or the
incremental snapshot use a different directory.
