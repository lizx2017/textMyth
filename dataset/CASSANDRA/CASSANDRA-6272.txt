Summary:
sstableloader data distribution is broken since 1.2.7
Description:
Running sstableloader on 1.2.10+ results in radically different distribution compared with earlier versions. It looks as though the 'bare-bones' IndexSummary created in SSTR.loadForBatch is the cause (CASSANDRA-5555); because it contains only a single entry, we end up with the wrong segment of the index file in SSTR.getPosition (its position is always 0), so only the first segment of the index file is considered when searching for the range's position.
This doesn't affect 2.0/trunk
