Summary:
Disallow renaming an indexed column
Description:
We can now index CQL3 primary key parts (CASSANDRA-5125) but also allow to rename such columns. Unfortunately, since 2ndary index CF names currently depend on the name of the column they index, renaming an indexed column basically ends up dropping the index.
For now, the simplest solution is probably to just forbid renaming when the column is 2ndary indexed. If you really want to rename, you can always drop the index and recreate it after the rename.
