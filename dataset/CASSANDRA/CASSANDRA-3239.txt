Summary:
can't use RackInferringSnitch and CQL JDBC's "CREATE KEYSPACE" with NetworkTopologyStrategy
Description:
If using the CQL JDBC driver, there's a problem with using RackInferringSnitch
1. With RackInferringSnitch, the datacenter names are numeric
2. With CQL and NetworkTopologyStrategy, the data center replicas are specified as strategy_options:<dc-name>=<#-of-replicas>
3. Using a number for <dc-name> fails
4. Using a quoted number for <dc-name> fails
