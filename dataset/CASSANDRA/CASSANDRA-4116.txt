Summary:
check most recent TS values in SSTables when a row tombstone has already been encountered
Description:
once C* comes across a row tombstone, C* should check the TS on the tombstone against all SSTables. If the most recent TS in an SST is older than the row tombstone, that entire SST (or the remainder of it) can be safely ignored.
There are two drivers for this.
avoid checking column values that could not possibly be in the result set
avoid OOMing because all the tombstones are temporarily kept in memory.
