Summary:
avoid distributed deadlock in migration stage
Description:
This is follow-up work for the remainders of CASSANDRA-3832 which was only a partial fix. The deadlock in the migration stage needs to be fixed, as it can cause bootstrap (at least) to take potentially a very very long time to complete, and might also cause a lack of schema propagation until otherwise "poked".
