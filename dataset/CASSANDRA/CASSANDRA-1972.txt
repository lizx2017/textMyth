Summary:
Default concurrency values are improperly proportioned
Description:
The "default"/"suggested" concurrent_reads value is much too low. It assumes that CPU will be the bottleneck, rather than IO, and for most deployments, this will not be the case. Additionally it is better to be queued for IO in the kernel or on your device than in user space, because the former work to optimize queue order.
Additionally, reads are much cheaper than writes in terms of CPU time (since writes can experience contention due to retries), so while concurrent_writes should probably factor in the number of cores on the machine, concurrent_reads should probably be calculated purely by number of spindles.
