Summary:
Add missing systems to FBUtilities.isUnix, add FBUtilities.isWindows
Description:
The isUnix method leaves out a few unix systems, which, after the changes in CASSANDRA-8136, causes some unexpected behavior during shutdown. It would also be clearer if FBUtilities had an isWindows method for branching into Windows specific logic.
