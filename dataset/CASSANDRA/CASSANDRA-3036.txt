Summary:
Vague primary key references in CQL
Description:
create columnfamily wonk (id 'utf8' primary key, id int)
update wonk set id=1 where id='test'
create index wonk_id on wonk (id)
This does what you would expect but then the results are unclear when using 'id' in a where clause.
"select * from wonk where id=1" returns nothing and "select * from wonk where id='test'" works fine.
Perhaps secondary indexes should not be allowed on columns that have the same name as the key_alias? At least a warning or something should be thrown to indicate you've just made a useless index.
