Summary:
DC Local repair or -hosts should only be allowed with -full repair
Description:
We should not let users mix incremental repair with dc local repair or -host or any repair which does not include all replicas.
This will currently cause stables on some replicas to be marked as repaired. The next incremental repair will not work on same set of data.
