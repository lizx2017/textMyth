Summary:
Cassandra can't find jamm on startup
Description:
I installed the Debian package (from http://www.apache.org/dist/cassandra/debian unstable) of Cassandra 0.8beta2 on Ubuntu 10.04 with the sun jdk over a working copy of 0.7.2. It broke on restart.
On startup it gives this:
Error occurred during initialization of VM
agent library failed to init: instrument
Error opening zip file or JAR manifest missing : /lib/jamm-0.2.2.jar
/etc/cassandra/cassandra-env.sh contains this:
# add the jamm javaagent
check_openjdk=$(java -version 2>&1 | awk '{if (NR == 2) {print $1}}')
if [ "$check_openjdk" != "OpenJDK" ]
then
    JVM_OPTS="$JVM_OPTS -javaagent:$CASSANDRA_HOME/lib/jamm-0.2.2.jar"
fi
By default, CASSANDRA_HOME is not set, so it's looking in /lib for this jar. It seems CASSANDRA_HOME should be set to /usr/share/cassandra, since that's where jamm-0.2.2.jar is installed, but that means the path is still wrong.
I set CASSANDRA_HOME to /usr/share/cassandra and changed the JVM_OPTS line to this:
    JVM_OPTS="$JVM_OPTS -javaagent:$CASSANDRA_HOME/jamm-0.2.2.jar"
and then cassandra started ok.
Is this a bug or did I miss something?
I also noticed that this line appears to be the only use of CASSANDRA_HOME.
