Summary:
Peer entry drops from system table silently when bootstrapping a node with an existing IP.
Description:
It looks like CASSANDRA-5167 introduced a bit of a regression. I needed to rebuild the data on a malfunctioning node by rebootstrapping it. I did this by cleaning the host and restarting Cassandra. My plan was to remove the old hostID once it had successfully bootstrapped.
No errors were encountered, but the old host ID of the node before the wipe was completely dropped from the peers table because they had the same IP address, and therefore the data ranges were moved around. This resulted in a large number of CL.ONE reads coming back empty.
There might be a better approach to this rebootstrap process, but it seems like it's dangerous to just drop the peer from the table, especially without any kind of log message.
