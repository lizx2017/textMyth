Summary:
StorageProxy may submit hint to itself (with an assert) for CL.Any
Description:
StorageProxy.mutate may produce WriteTimoutException and with ConsistencyLevel.ANY it tries to submitHint. But submitHint function have assertation - we may not send hints to ourself. That may lead to exception (in case we're among natural endpoints) and hint will be not submitted to other endpoints.
