Summary:
cassandra-cli has backwards index status message
Description:
When a secondary index is building, the total bytes and processed bytes are swapped in the message. Example:
Currently building index cf1, completed 12052040551 of 18047343 bytes.
The problem is a call to CompactionInfo constructor with swapped parameters. Patch to follow.
