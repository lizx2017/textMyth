Summary:
Windows does not handle ipv6 addresses
Description:
In cassandra.ps1, we are pulling the listen and rpc addresses from the yaml by splitting on :, then selecting [1] from the resulting split, to separate the yaml key from the value.
Unfortunately, because ipv6 addresses contain : characters, this means we are not grabbing the whole address, causing problems when starting the node.
