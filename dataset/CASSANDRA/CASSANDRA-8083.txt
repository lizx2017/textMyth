Summary:
OpenJDK 6 Dependency in dsc20 RPM
Description:
According to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-6925 and https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-7243, the Cassandra project only produces platform-agnostic .tar.gz. The person in the second ticket was referred to https://support.datastax.com/home to report RPM issues, but this ticketing system requires a login to post and registration is not open. I realize this is not the right issue tracker to post this on, but I hope to reach the community repo maintainer through this one.
The problem I'm facing only seems to occur for the 'cassandra20' package from the Datastax community repo. On a fresh CentOS installation with no prior Java stack installed:
yum install dsc20
Installing:
dsc20
Installing for dependencies:
java-1.6.0-openjdk
...
cassandra20
This inevitably results in the following log message:
"Cassandra 2.0 and later require Java 7 or later."
and sometimes
"Unsupported major.minor version 51.0"
The issue seems to be with the 'cassandra20' package that depends on openjdk6. I noticed the same behaviour with dsc21 a couple weeks ago, but this seems to be fixed already. Could you please take a look or assign this to a person who could?
