Summary:
nodetool snapshot does not handle keyspace arguments correctly
Description:
Given the following invocation:
./bin/nodetool snapshot Keyspace1 -t keyspace1_snapshot -h localhost
Snapshots are made for all keyspaces
Given a multi-keyspace invocation:
./bin/nodetool snapshot Keyspace1 Keyspace2 Keyspac3 -t keyspace1_snapshot -h localhost
Snapshots will be made for Keyspace2 and Keyspace3 but not Keyspace1.
It appears there is just some antiquated command argument noodling in NodeCmd#handleSnapshots
