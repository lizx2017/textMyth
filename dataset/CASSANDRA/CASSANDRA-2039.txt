Summary:
LazilyCompactedRow doesn't add CFInfo to digest
Description:
LazilyCompactedRow.update doesn't add the CFInfo or columnCount to the digest, so the hash value in the Merkle tree does not include this data. However, PrecompactedRow does include this. Two consequences of this are:
Row-level tombstones are not compared when using LazilyCompactedRow so could remain inconsistent
LazilyCompactedRow and PrecompactedRow produce different hashes of the same row, so if two nodes have differing in_memory_compaction_limit_in_mb values, rows of size in between the two limits will have different hashes so will always be repaired even when they are the same.
