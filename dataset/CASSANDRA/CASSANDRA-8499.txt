Summary:
Ensure SSTableWriter cleans up properly after failure
Description:
In 2.0 we do not free a bloom filter, in 2.1 we do not free a small piece of offheap memory for writing compression metadata. In both we attempt to flush the BF despite having encountered an exception, making the exception slow to propagate.
