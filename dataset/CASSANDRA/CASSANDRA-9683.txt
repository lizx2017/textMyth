Summary:
Get mucher higher load and latencies after upgrading from 2.1.6 to cassandra 2.1.7
Description:
After upgrading our cassandra staging cluster version from 2.1.6 to 2.1.7, the average load grows from 0.1-0.3 to 1.8.
Latencies did increase as well.
We see an increase of pending compactions, probably due to CASSANDRA-9592.
This cluster has almost no workload (staging environment)
