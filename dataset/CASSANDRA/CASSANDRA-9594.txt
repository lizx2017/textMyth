Summary:
metrics reporter doesn't start until after a bootstrap
Description:
In o.a.c.service.CassandraDaemon#setup, the metrics reporter is started immediately after the invocation of o.a.c.service.StorageService#initServer, which for a bootstrapping node may block for a considerable period of time. If the metrics reporter is your only source of visibility, then you are blind until the bootstrap completes.
