Summary:
Add all possible consistency levels to Cassandra-Stress and make LOCAL_ONE the default one
Description:
CASSANDRA-8253 added all of them but CASSANDRA-8769 delete some of them from CommandSettings.java
Also notice the default consistency is set to ONE, I believe it'd be better if we use LOCAL_ONE.
