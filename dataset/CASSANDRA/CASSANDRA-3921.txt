Summary:
Compaction doesn't clear out expired tombstones from SerializingCache
Description:
Compaction calls removeDeletedInCache, which looks like this:
.   public void removeDeletedInCache(DecoratedKey key)
    {
        ColumnFamily cachedRow = cfs.getRawCachedRow(key);
        if (cachedRow != null)
            ColumnFamilyStore.removeDeleted(cachedRow, gcBefore);
    }
For the SerializingCache, this means it calls removeDeleted on a temporary, deserialized copy, which leaves the cache contents unaffected.
