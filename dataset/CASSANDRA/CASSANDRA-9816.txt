Summary:
ALTER TABLE ADD validation is overly strict for re-added collection columns
Description:
AlterTableStatement ensures that we cannot re-add a collection column of a type that is incompatible with a previously existing, dropped one.
It doesn't make an exception, however, for frozen collections, yet those should be allowed.
Code in question:
if (dropped != null && (dropped.type == null || (dropped.type instanceof CollectionType && !type.isCompatibleWith(dropped.type))))
    throw new InvalidRequestException(String.format("Cannot add a collection with the name %s " +
                "because a collection with the same name and a different type%s has already been used in the past",
                columnName, dropped.type == null ? "" : " (" + dropped.type.asCQL3Type() + ")"));
