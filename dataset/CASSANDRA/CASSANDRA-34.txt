Summary:
Hinted handoff rows never get deleted
Description:
from the list: "after the hints are delivered, the hinted keys are deleted from the hinted CF only, but not from the application CF."
Prashant verified that this is a bug that can't be fixed until deletes are fully working.
Note: when we fix this, see if we can do so w/o compromising the immediate-GC of the hinted CF keys.
