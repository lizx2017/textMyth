Summary:
Incorrect parameter names in Thrift interface
Description:
The Thrift interface is incorrect as follows. This does not affect correctnes, it just makes it hard to understand the operations.
The Thrift interface for get_superColumn is incorrect. It seems to me that "3:string columnFamily" should really be "3:string columnFamily_superColumnName" (I know this doesn't have any functional impact, just makes it hard to understand what the operation does)
The Thrift interface for get_slice_super is incorrect. It seems to me that "3:string columnFamily_superColumnName" should really be "3:string columnFamily"
