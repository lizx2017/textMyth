Summary:
cli silently fails when classes are quoted
Description:
For example: CREATE COLUMN FAMILY autocomplete_meta WITH comparator = 'UTF8Type' AND default_validation_class = 'UTF8Type' AND key_validation_class = 'UTF8Type'
Neither validation class is actually set, but if you remove the quotes everything works.
