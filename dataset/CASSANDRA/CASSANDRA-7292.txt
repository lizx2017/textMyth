Summary:
Can't seed new node into ring with (public) ip of an old node
Description:
This bug prevents node to return with bootstrap into the cluster with its old ip.
Scenario: five node ec2 cluster spread into three AZ, all in one region. I'm using Ec2MultiRegionSnitch. Nodes are reported with their public ips (as Ec2MultiRegionSnitch requires)
I simulated a loss of one node by terminating one instance. nodetool status reported correctly that node was down. Then I launched new instance with the old public ip (i'm using elastic ips) with "Dcassandra.replace_address=IP_ADDRESS" but the new node can't join the cluster:

It does not help if I remove the "Dcassandra.replace_address=IP_ADDRESS" system property.
Also it does not help to remove the node with "nodetool removenode" with or without the cassandra.replace_address property.
I think this is because the node information is preserved in the gossip info as seen this output of "nodetool gossipinfo"
