Summary:
Exception count not incremented on OutOfMemoryError (HSHA)
Description:
One of our nodes decided to stop listening on 9160 (netstat -l was showing nothing and telnet was reporting connection refused). Nodetool status showed no hosts down and on the offending node nodetool info gave the following:
nodetool info
Token            : (invoke with -T/--tokens to see all 256 tokens)

After looking at the cassandra log, I saw a bunch of the following:

There wasn't anything else overtly suspicious in the logs except for the occasional
ERROR [Selector-Thread-0] 2013-10-27 17:35:58,662 TNonblockingServer.java (line 468) Read an invalid frame size of 0. Are you using TFramedTransport on the client side?
but that periodically comes up - I have looked into it before but it has never seemed to have any serious impact.
This ticket is not about why an OutOfMemoryError occurred - which is bad but I don't think I have enough information to reproduce or speculate on a cause. This ticket is about the fact that an OutOfMemoryError occurred and nodetool info was reporting Thrift active : true and Exceptions : 0.
Our monitoring systems and investigation processes are both starting to rely on on the exception count. The fact that it was not accurate here is disconcerting.
