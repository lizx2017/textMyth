Summary:
snapshots taken before repair are not cleared if snapshot fails
Description:
running repair service the following directory was created for the snapshots:
drwxr-xr-x 2 cassandra cassandra 36864 Nov 5 07:47 073d16e0-64c0-11e4-8e9a-7b3d4674c508
but the system.log reports the following error which suggests the snapshot failed:
ERROR [RMI TCP Connection(3251)-10.150.27.78] 2014-11-05 07:47:55,734 StorageService.java (line 2599) Repair session 073d16e0-64c0-11e4-8e9a-7b3d4674c508 for range (7530018576963469312,7566047373982433280] failed with error java.io.IOException: Failed during snapshot creation. java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException: java.lang.RuntimeException: java.io.IOException: Failed during snapshot creation. .... ERROR [AntiEntropySessions:3312] 2014-11-05 07:47:55,731 RepairSession.java (line 288) repair #073d16e0-64c0-11e4-8e9a-7b3d4674c508 session completed with the following error java.io.IOException: Failed during snapshot creation.
the problem is that the directory for the snapshots that fail are just left on the disk and don't get cleaned up. They must be removed manually, which is not ideal.
