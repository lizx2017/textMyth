Summary:
Getting Started instructions don't work in README.txt - wrong version of jamm, wrong path
Description:
Download latest release from http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi?path=/cassandra/1.0.3/apache-cassandra-1.0.3-bin.tar.gz
Unpack the tarball.
Follow instructions in README.txt, concluding with:
dna@master:~/code/apache-cassandra-1.0.3$ bin/cassandra -f
Error opening zip file or JAR manifest missing : /lib/jamm-0.2.1.jar
Error occurred during initialization of VM
agent library failed to init: instrument
Firstly, the version of jamm packaged with Cassandra 1.0.3 is jamm-0.2.5, not jamm-0.2.1.
Both bin/cassandra.bat and conf/cassandra-env.sh reference jamm-0.2.5 so not sure where jamm-0.2.1 is being referenced from - nothing obvious using grep.
Secondly, /lib/jamm-0.2.1.jar is the wrong path - should be set relative to working directory, not filesystem root
(Incidentally, Cassandra v1.0.3 is still listed as unreleased on JIRA.)
