Summary:
CFMetaData.convertToThrift makes subcomparator_type empty string instead of null
Description:
As a result of CASSANDRA-891 adding a CFMetaData.convertToThrift method, the values such as subcomparator_type are defaulted to empty string instead of null. That makes it so, for example, in ColumnFamilyRecordReader, in its RowIterator, the check for only null is insufficient. It also needs to check for a blank value.
After a discussion about it in IRC, Jonathan said it was probably easier to just change the creation to give a null value instead of empty string.
