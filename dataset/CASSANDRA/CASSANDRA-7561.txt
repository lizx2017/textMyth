Summary:
On DROP we should invalidate CounterKeyCache as well as Key/Row cache
Description:
We should also probably ensure we don't attempt to auto save any of the caches while they are in an inconsistent state (i.e. there are keys present to be saved that should not be restored, or that would throw exceptions when we save (e.g. CounterCacheKey))
