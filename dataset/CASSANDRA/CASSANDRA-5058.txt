Summary:
debian packaging should include shuffle
Description:
Our debian packaging doesn't currently include shuffle, but we should add it so people have a way of upgrading to vnodes. This might also be a good time to consider a different name for shuffle, though I don't believe it currently conflicts with anything else.
