Summary:
Failed to flush SSTable can cause commit log not to reply
Description:
When flushing failed(e.g. out of disk space), that memtable was kept in memtablePendingFlush and might trigger next flush inside MeteredFlusher since it would be always calculated in countFlushingBytes.
If that next flush succeeded(e.g. this time it fit on disk), ReplayPosition was recorded at that point, and would cause commit log not to replay for the data that was not flushed.
