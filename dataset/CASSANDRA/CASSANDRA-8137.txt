Summary:
Prepared statement size overflow error
Description:
When using C* 2.1.0 and Ruby-driver master, I get the following error when running the Ruby duration test (which prepares a lot of statements, in many threads):
Prepared statement of size 4451848 bytes is larger than allowed maximum of 2027520 bytes.
Prepared statement of size 4434568 bytes is larger than allowed maximum of 2027520 bytes.
They usually occur in batches of 1, but sometimes in multiples as seen above. It happens occasionally, around 20% of the time when running the code. Unfortunately I don't have a stacktrace as the error isn't recorded in the system log.
This is my schema, and the offending prepare statement:
@session.execute("CREATE TABLE duration_test.ints (
                        key INT,
                        copy INT,
                        value INT,
                        PRIMARY KEY (key, copy))"
)
select = @session.prepare("SELECT * FROM ints WHERE key=?")
Now, I notice that if I explicitly specify the keyspace in the prepare, I don't get the error.
