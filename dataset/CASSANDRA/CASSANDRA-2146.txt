Summary:
cli read_repair_chance input not validated
Description:
put(ColumnFamilyArgument.READ_REPAIR_CHANCE, "Probability (0.0-1.0) with which to perform read repairs on CL.ONE reads");
The input range is not enforced so
create column family ... with ... read_repair_chance = 25;
Will result in
Keyspace: ks1:
  Replication Strategy: org.apache.cassandra.locator.SimpleStrategy
    Replication Factor: 3
  Column Families:
    ColumnFamily: cf1
      Columns sorted by: org.apache.cassandra.db.marshal.UTF8Type
...
      Read repair chance: 25.0
I am unsure if in practice this means RR chance 100%, or something surprising. (I ran into this because read_repair_chance requires a leading 0 and ommiting it results in an unhelpful "Command not found:" message).
