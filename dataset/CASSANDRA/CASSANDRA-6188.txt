Summary:
The JMX stats for Speculative Retry stops moving during a node failure outage period
Description:
Under normal testing traffic level with default Cassandra Speculative Retry configuration for each table (i.e. 99 percentile), JConsole shows that the JMX stats for Speculative Retry increments slowly. However, during the node failure outage period (i.e. immediately after the node was killed and before the gossip figures out that the node is down), JConsole shows that the JMX stats for Speculative Retry stops moving. That is, for around 20 seconds, the JMX stats for Speculative Retry does not move.
This is true for all other Speculative Retry options.
