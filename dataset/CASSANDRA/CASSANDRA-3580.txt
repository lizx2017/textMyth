Summary:
Don't assume the Table instance has been open when dropping a keyspace
Description:
DropKeyspace assumes that the Table had been open (rather, it checks that Table.clear() don't return null). It has been seen however that in the case of a fat client (the sstableloader in that case, but it would be true for any fat client) the Table may not have been open. Let's just remove that assertion.
