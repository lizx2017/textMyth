Summary:
Deprecate unlogged batches
Description:
Officially mark unlogged batches deprecated.
Note that the main "good" use case for unlogged batches, of multiple updates in a single partition key, is "free" when done as a logged batch. So really unlogged batches mainly serve as a honeypot to trick new users into abusing them in misguided bulk loading attempts.
