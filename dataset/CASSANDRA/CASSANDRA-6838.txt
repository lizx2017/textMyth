Summary:
FileCacheService overcounting its memoryUsage
Description:
On investigating why I was seeing dramatically worse performance for counter updates over prepared CQL3 statements compred to unprepared CQL2 statements, I stumbled upon a bug in FileCacheService wherein, on returning a cached reader back to the pool, its memory is counted again towards the total memory usage, but is not matched by a decrement when checked out. So we effectively are probably not caching readers most of the time.
