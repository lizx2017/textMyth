Summary:
The describe_host API method is misleading in that it returns the interface associated with gossip traffic
Description:
If the hardware is configured to use separate interfaces for thrift and gossip, the gossip interface will be returned, given the results come out of the ReplicationStrategy eventually.
I understand the approach, but given this is on the API, it effective worthless in situations of host auto discovery via describe_ring from a client. I actually see this as the primary use case of this method - why else would I care about the gossip iface from the client perspective? It's current form should be relegated to JMX only.
At the same time, we should add port information as well.
describe_splits probably has similar issues.
I see the potential cart-before-horse issues here and that this will probably be non-trivial to fix, but I think "give me a set of all the hosts to which I can talk" is pretty important from a client perspective.
