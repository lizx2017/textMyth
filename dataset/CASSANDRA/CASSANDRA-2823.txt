Summary:
NPE during range slices with rowrepairs
Description:
Doing some heavy testing of relatively fast feeding (5000+ mutations/sec) + repair on all node + range slices.
Then occasionally killing a node here and there and restarting it.
Triggers the following NPE
ERROR [pool-2-thread-3] 2011-06-24 20:56:27,289 Cassandra.java (line 3210) Internal error processing get_range_slices

Looking at the code in getReduced:
                ColumnFamily resolved = versions.size() > 1
                                      ? RowRepairResolver.resolveSuperset(versions)
                                      : versions.get(0);
seems like resolved becomes null when this happens and versions.size is larger than 1.
RowRepairResolver.resolveSuperset() does actually return null if it cannot resolve anything, so there is definately a case here which can occur and is not handled.
It may also be an interesting question if it is guaranteed that
versions.add(current.left.cf);
can never return null?
Jonathan suggested on IRC that maybe
                ColumnFamily resolved = versions.size() > 1
                                      ? RowRepairResolver.resolveSuperset(versions)
                                      : versions.get(0);
                if (resolved == null)
                      return new Row(key, resolved);
could be a fix.
