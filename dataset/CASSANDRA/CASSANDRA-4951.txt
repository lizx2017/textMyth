Summary:
Leveled compaction manifest sometimes references nonexistent sstables in a snapshot
Description:
After nodetool snapshot on a node under load, we sometimes see sstables not referenced in the leveled compaction json manifest, or sstables in the manifest which are not found on disk. There are two concerns with this:
1. What would happened to leveled compaction and to reads if the snapshot is restored with missing or extra sstables?
2. Is this a sign of a snapshot not having a complete copy of the data?
To support automated restore, manifest and/or a list of links should be made correct at snapshot time.
