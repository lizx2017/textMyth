Summary:
Local range scans are not run on the read stage
Description:
Running directly on the client request/StorageProxy thread means we're now allowing one range scan per thrift thread instead of one per read stage thread [which may be more, or less, depending on thrift server mode], and it bypasses the "drop hopeless requests" overcapacity protection built in there.
