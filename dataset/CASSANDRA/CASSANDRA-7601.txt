Summary:
Data loss after nodetool taketoken
Description:
The dtest consistent_bootstrap_test.py:TestBootstrapConsistency.consistent_reads_after_relocate_test is failing on HEAD of the git branches 2.1 and 2.1.0.
The test performs the following actions:
Create a cluster of 3 nodes
Create a keyspace with RF 2
Take node 3 down
Write 980 rows to node 2 with CL ONE
Flush node 2
Bring node 3 back up
Run nodetool taketoken on node 3 to transfer 80% of node 1's tokens to node 3
Check for data loss
When the check for data loss is performed, only ~725 rows can be read via CL ALL.
