Summary:
Select Count with Limit returns wrong value
Description:
The dtest cql_tests.py:TestCQL.select_count_paging_test is failing on trunk HEAD but not 2.1-HEAD.
The query
 select count(*) from test where field3 = false limit 1; 
is returning 2, where obviously it should only return 1 because of the limit. This may end up having the same root cause of #8214, I will be bisecting them both soon.
