Summary:
Describe keyspace error
Description:
I was testing Cassandra 2.1.0rc5 on OpsCenter and noticed something odd in the diagnostic tarball. The keyspace that I had created show up, but not the name of the column family. So I tried cqlsh and this was the result.
[cqlsh 5.0.1 | Cassandra 2.1.0-rc5 | CQL spec 3.2.0 | Native protocol v3]
Use HELP for help.
cqlsh> describe keyspace funspace;

too many values to unpack
cqlsh> describe keyspaces;

system_traces  funspace  system  "OpsCenter"  "Keyspace1"
My dataset is attached.
