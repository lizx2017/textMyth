Summary:
Add option to disable tcp_nodelay
Description:
Add option to disable TCP_NODELAY for cross-dc communication.
Reason is we are seeing huge amounts of packets being sent over our poor firewalls.
For us, disabling this for inter-dc communication increases average packet size from ~400 bytes to ~1300 bytes.
