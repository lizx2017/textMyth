Summary:
Fix typo in CFDefinition (regarding static columns)
Description:
As noted on CASSANDRA-7449, there is a typo in CFDefinition:
public Collection<Name> staticColumns()
{
    return regularColumns.values();
}
I'll note that this is currently completely inconsequential since this method is only used by AbstractCassandraStorage, but in a case where there can't be any static columns (because the CFDefinition uses comes from a CFMetadata.fromThrift() that can't have them). Not a reason to leave the typo of course.
