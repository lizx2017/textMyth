Summary:
Failure Detector should log or ignore sudden time change to the past
Description:
If a machine goes back in time all of a sudden because of a problem, Gossip will insert a negative interArrivalTime.
This will decrease the mean value and can cause this machine to mark other nodes as down and then mark them up as time passed.
But we should log such occurrences.
