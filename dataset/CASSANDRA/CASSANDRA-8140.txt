Summary:
Compaction has no effects
Description:
Hi there,
I'm on cassandra 2.1 since then I figured out that in some circumstances (I can't find a way to reproduce them constantly) minor compactions and full compactions had no effects.
We are on a cluster composed of 5 nodes with around 500gb of data, no deletions around 1.5k updates/s and same on reads.
After a repair I saw that a couple of nodes were `slow`, I investigate further and I found that on these two nodes the number of sstable were around 20.000+ ! We use STC.
So with node tool I triggered a full compaction, It took less than I minute (with nothing in the logs) and of course the number of sstable didn't go down.
Then I drained the node, and I ran again with `nodetool compact`, at that point the number of sstables went down to less than 10.
I tough was a strange spot problem. However after a week I noticed that one node had ~100 sstabels where others just 8-10.
I ran again the compaction (It last less than a minute with nothing in logs) and didn't change anything. I drained it and restarted then compacted and took several hours to get it back close to 2/3 sstables.
What could be? We never incurred this behavior before.
Here informations about the table:
CREATE TABLE xyz (
    ppk text PRIMARY KEY,
   .. ten more columns...
) WITH bloom_filter_fp_chance = 0.01
    AND caching = '{"keys":"ALL", "rows_per_partition":"NONE"}'
    AND comment = ''
    AND compaction = {'min_threshold': '4', 'cold_reads_to_omit': '0.0', 'class': 'org.apache.cassandra.db.compaction.SizeTieredCompactionStrategy', 'max_threshold': '32'}
    AND compression = {'sstable_compression': 'org.apache.cassandra.io.compress.SnappyCompressor'}
    AND dclocal_read_repair_chance = 0.0
    AND default_time_to_live = 0
    AND gc_grace_seconds = 864000
    AND max_index_interval = 2048
    AND memtable_flush_period_in_ms = 0
    AND min_index_interval = 128
    AND read_repair_chance = 0.0
    AND speculative_retry = '99.0PERCENTILE';

Is there anything else that I can provide?
