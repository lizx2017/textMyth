Summary:
nodetool repair never finishes. Loops forever through merkle trees?
Description:
I am not sure all steps here is needed, but as part of testing something else, I set up
node1: initial_token: 1
node2: initial_token: 5
Then:
create keyspace myks 
 with placement_strategy = 'org.apache.cassandra.locator.SimpleStrategy'
 with strategy_options = [{ replication_factor:2 }];

use myks;

create column family test with comparator = AsciiType and column_metadata=[ {column_name: 'up_', validation_class: LongType, index_type: 0}, {column_name: 'del_', validation_class: LongType, index_type: 0} ]
 and keys_cached = 100000 and rows_cached = 10000 and min_compaction_threshold = 2;
quit;
Doing nodetool repair after this gets both nodes busy looping forever.
A quick look at one node in eclipse makes me guess its having fun spinning through merkle trees, but I have to admit I have not look at it for a long time.
