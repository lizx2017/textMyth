Summary:
CqlRecordWriter does not adequately determine if driver failed to connect due to interrupt
Description:
Until https://datastax-oss.atlassian.net/browse/JAVA-769 is implemented, I have had to implement a workaround.
Java's thread interrupt status flag can be cleared for any number of reasons. After discussion, I've changed to parsing the driver's DriverException to tell if we are safe to retry the failed connection.
