Summary:
When loading an AbstractType that does not include an instance field, an unhelpful exception is raised making diagnosis difficult
Description:
0.7.0 changes the contract for creating AbstractTypes. A custom AbstractType defined against 0.6.x will be incompatible and the error messaging around why the comparator is invalid is obtuse and non-obvious. Specifically, when porting a valid AbstractType from 0.6.x to 0.7 that does not include a public static instance field, the thrift system_add_column_family call will throw an exception whose only message is:
InvalidRequestException(why:instance)
No log messages are generated from the server as to the issue so the root cause is non obvious to developers.
I marked as Major because types defined against 0.6.x did not require an "instance" field so at a minimum migration of AbstractTypes to 0.7 should document the change in what is expected of AbstractTypes.
Patch attached for better logging and to create a more helpful exception for better communication to the client as to the issue.
