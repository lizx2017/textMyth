Summary:
Snappy Compression does not work with PowerPC 64-bit, Little Endian
Description:
In PowerPC 64-bit, Little Endian, CompressedRandomAccessReaderTest, CompressedInputStreamTest, and CFMetaDataTest fail due to the included snappy-java JAR missing the ppc64le native library.
Testing on Ubuntu 14.04, ppc64le.
The specific fix for Snappy-Java and adding the native library can be found at https://github.com/xerial/snappy-java/pull/67.
