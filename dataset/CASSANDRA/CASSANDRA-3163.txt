Summary:
SlabAllocator OOMs much faster than HeapAllocator
Description:
SlabAllocator will OOM with stress at around 5.5M rows, which in this configuration is roughly 3.3M rows per node. Reverting to the HeapAllocator allowed all 10M rows to finish. Examining the SA heap dump in MAT just shows ~98% of the heap is in 'remainder'
