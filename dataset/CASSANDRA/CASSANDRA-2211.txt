Summary:
Cleanup can create sstables whose contents do not match their advertised version
Description:
Since cleanup switched to per-sstable operation (CASSANDRA-1916), the main loop looks like this:
                    if (Range.isTokenInRanges(row.getKey().token, ranges))
                    {
                        writer = maybeCreateWriter(sstable, compactionFileLocation, expectedBloomFilterSize, writer);
                        writer.append(new EchoedRow(row));
                        totalkeysWritten++;
                    }
                    else
                    {
                        while (row.hasNext())
                        {
                            IColumn column = row.next();
                            if (indexedColumns.contains(column.name()))
                                Table.cleanupIndexEntry(cfs, row.getKey().key, column);
                        }
                    }
... that is, rows that haven't changed we copy to the new sstable without deserializing, with EchoedRow. But, the new sstable is created with CURRENT_VERSION which may not be what the old data consisted of.
(This could cause symptoms similar to CASSANDRA-2195 but I do not think it is the cause of that bug; IIRC the cluster in question there was not upgraded from an older Cassandra.)
