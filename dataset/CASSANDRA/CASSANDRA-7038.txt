Summary:
Nodetool rebuild_index requires named indexes argument
Description:
In addition to explicitly listing the indexes to be rebuilt, nodetool rebuild_indexes will also accept just keyspace & columnfamily arguments, indicating that all indexes for that ks/cf should be rebuilt.
This doesn't actually work as CFS.rebuildSecondaryIndex requires the explicit list. In the 2 arg version, nodetool just passes an empty list here and so the rebuild becomes a no-op. As this has been the case since CASSANDRA-3860 (AFAICT, 80ea03f is the commit that removed this) we may as well just remove the option from nodetool, patch attached to do that.
