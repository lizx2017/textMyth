Summary:
Logic of AbstractNetworkTopologySnitch.compareEndpoints is wrong
Description:
Current logic in ANTS.cE is to compare the rack and then compare the DC's, the problem is when we have the same rack name but the racks are in a diffrent DC's this logic breaks...
Example:
"us-east,1a", InetAddress.getByName("127.0.0.1")
"us-east,1b", InetAddress.getByName("127.0.0.2")
"us-east,1c", InetAddress.getByName("127.0.0.3")
"us-west,1a", InetAddress.getByName("127.0.0.4")
"us-west,1b", InetAddress.getByName("127.0.0.5")
"us-west,1c", InetAddress.getByName("127.0.0.6")
Expected:
/127.0.0.1,/127.0.0.3,/127.0.0.2,/127.0.0.4,/127.0.0.5,/127.0.0.6
Current:
/127.0.0.1,/127.0.0.4,/127.0.0.3,/127.0.0.2,/127.0.0.5,/127.0.0.6
