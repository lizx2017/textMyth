Summary:
cqlsh errors on comments that end with a semicolon
Description:
Commented-out lines that end in a semicolon cause an error.
Examples:
cqlsh> – CREATE KEYSPACE ELE WITH replication_factor = 3 AND strategy_class = SimpleStrategy AND strategy_options:replication_factor=3;
Bad Request: line 0:-1 no viable alternative at input '<EOF>'
cqlsh> – CREATE KEYSPACE ELE WITH replication_factor = 3 AND strategy_class = SimpleStrategy AND strategy_options:replication_factor=3
...
...
... ;
Bad Request: line 2:0 no viable alternative at input ';'
cqlsh> – ;
Bad Request: line 0:-1 no viable alternative at input '<EOF>'
cqlsh> --;
Bad Request: line 0:-1 no viable alternative at input '<EOF>'
As long as there's a line with valid CQL before the semicolon, things work fine though.
I'm pretty sure the problem is on line 75 of cqlsh:
if not line.endswith(";"):
self.set_prompt(Shell.continue_prompt)
return None
A quick workaround would be to kill the pretty continue prompt. A more involved fix would detect whether or not the semicolon was in a comment. This is harder than it sounds, since /* and */ allow multi-line comments.
