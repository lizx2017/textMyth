Summary:
in a cluster, get_range_slice() does not return all the keys it should
Description:
get_range_slice() does not return the same set of keys as get_key_range() in 0.5.0 final.
I posted a program to reproduce the behavior:

Apparently, you must have more than one node to get the behavior. Also, it may depend on the locations of the nodes on the ring.. I.e., if you don't generate enough keys randomly, then by chance they could all fall on the same host and you might not see the behavior, although I was able to get it to happen using only 2 nodes and 10 keys.
Here are the other emails describing the issue:
