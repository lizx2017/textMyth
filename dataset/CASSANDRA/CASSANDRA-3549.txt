Summary:
streaming is hard-coded to be single-threaded
Description:
It turns out, after we were scratching our heads as to why we weren't streaming as fast as expected when we bootstrapped 24 additional nodes in a 24 node cluster, that a node will only ever stream one outgoing file at a time. This is because the MessagingService instantiates it's streamExecturor_ in such a way that it gets a maximum size of 1.
This is particularly bad because there is no mechanism to ensure that destination nodes stream "evenly" from availabe source nodes, so some source nodes were dogpiled.
Meanwhile, the streams that were active were bottlenecking (in our case) on the destination side due to writes. In the end the aggregate throughput bootstrapping in the cluster was far below intended.
Will submit a patch once we've confirmed it seems safe and that there's no concurrency issue lurking.
