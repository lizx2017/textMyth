Summary:
Super Columns exception during upgrade from C* 1.2.18 to C* 2.0.11
Description:
While in the middle of an upgrade of a 12-node cluster, the following errors were constantly being reported in the logs:
ERROR [WRITE-/10.73.73.26] 2015-03-02 22:59:12,523 OutboundTcpConnection.java (line 234) error writing to /xx.xx.xx.xx

Confirmed that code is accessing cluster via Thrift and not CQL API.
This issue is very similar to CASSANDRA-6966 but may relate to the way that single slice and reversed is being handled.
