Summary:
Service fails to starts since mkdir /var/lib/cassandra fails
Description:
After installing the debian and running 'sudo service cassandra start' I see this in the output.log:
Caused by: java.io.IOException: unable to mkdirs /var/lib/cassandra/data.
After running this workaround:
sudo mkdir /var/lib/cassandra
sudo chown cassandra:cassandra /var/lib/cassandra
The service starts.
On ami-cef405a7 in EC2. Ubuntu 10.10 (official release).
