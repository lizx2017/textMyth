Summary:
Don't announce schema version until we've loaded the changes locally
Description:
Currently, we call updateSchemaAndAnnounce (which sets the schema version in the system table and announce it on gossip) in DefsTable.mergeSchema as soon as we've persisted the schema mutation but before we've actually loaded new/updated KS/CF locally. This makes it impossible to reliably check for schema agreement in a cluster as even if all nodes have the same version set in the system tables, you could still get an insert on a new table rejected because the table hasn't been loaded yet.
