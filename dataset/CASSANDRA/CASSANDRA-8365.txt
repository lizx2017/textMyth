Summary:
CamelCase name is used as index name instead of lowercase
Description:
In cqlsh, when I execute a CREATE INDEX FooBar ... statement, the CamelCase name is used as index name, even though it is unquoted. Trying to quote the index name results in a syntax error.
However, when I try to delete the index, I have to quote the index name, otherwise I get an invalid-query error telling me that the index (lowercase) does not exist.
This seems inconsistent. Shouldn't the index name be lowercased before the index is created ?
Here is the code to reproduce the issue :
cqlsh:schemabuilderit> CREATE TABLE IndexTest (a int primary key, b int);
cqlsh:schemabuilderit> CREATE INDEX FooBar on indextest (b);
cqlsh:schemabuilderit> DESCRIBE TABLE indextest ;

CREATE TABLE schemabuilderit.indextest (
    a int PRIMARY KEY,
    b int
) ........;
CREATE INDEX FooBar ON schemabuilderit.indextest (b);

cqlsh:schemabuilderit> DROP INDEX FooBar;
code=2200 [Invalid query] message="Index 'foobar' could not be found in any of the tables of keyspace 'schemabuilderit'"
