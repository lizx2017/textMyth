Summary:
debian init script could be more consistent w/ bin/cassandra
Description:
With the introduction of conf/cassandra-env.sh it should be possible to eliminate the separately maintained /etc/default/cassandra. The init script should also use a JAVA_HOME derived from the java binary in PATH (if it exists), both because this is how things work in Debian (the Java is the one chosen by alternatives), and because this is how bin/cassandra works as well.
Patches to follow.
