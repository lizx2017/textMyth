Summary:
probably don't need to do full copy to row cache after un-mmap() change
Description:
3179 changes from directly using the bytebuffer from mmap(), to copying that buffer,
CFS.cacheRow() https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/cassandra-1.0.0/src/java/org/apache/cassandra/db/ColumnFamilyStore.java line 1126
says it makes a deep copy exactly to prevent issues from unmmap().
maybe this deep copy is not needed now given 3179
if so, maybe slightly better performance in both speed and memory
