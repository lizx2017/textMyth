Summary:
Errors in JVM_OPTS and cassandra_parms environment vars
Description:
Repos:
deb http://www.apache.org/dist/cassandra/debian 21x main
deb-src http://www.apache.org/dist/cassandra/debian 21x main
The cassandra init script
/etc/init.d/cassandra
is sourcing the environment file
/etc/cassandra/cassandra-env.sh
twice. Once directly from the init script, and again inside
/usr/sbin/cassandra
The result is arguments in JVM_OPTS are duplicated.
Further the JVM opt
-XX:CMSWaitDuration=10000
is defined twice if jvm >= 1.7.60.
Also, for the environment variable CASSANDRA_CONF used in this context
-XX:CompileCommandFile=$CASSANDRA_CONF/hotspot_compiler"
is undefined when
/etc/cassandra/cassandra-env.sh
is sourced from the init script.
Lastly the variable cassandra_storagedir is undefined in
/usr/sbin/cassandra
when used in this context
-Dcassandra.storagedir=$cassandra_storagedir
