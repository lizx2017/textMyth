Summary:
Make gc_grace_seconds 7 days for system tables
Description:
The system tables have had a gc_grace_seconds of 8640 since CASSANDRA-4018. This was probably a typo and was intended to be 10 days. In CASSANDRA-6717 we will set gc_grace to seven days, so that would be a reasonable value to use here.
