Summary:
Collection types validation is incomplete
Description:
The collection types will complain if a value has less values than advertised, or if some of those values don't validate, but it does check that there is no remaining bytes after the collection. One consequence is that if you prepare INSERT INTO t(k, s) VALUES (0, ?) where s is a set, and you pass a map value (with the same type for keys and values than the set), then no error will be issued.
