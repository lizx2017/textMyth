Summary:
Launch scripts on Windows don't handle spaces gracefully
Description:
There's also some .ps1 problems after we get past just the .bat. Should be some trivial escaping to fix.
C:\src - Copy\cassandra\bin>cassandra.bat
Detected powershell execution permissions. Running with enhanced startup scripts.
Processing -File 'C:\src' failed because the file does not have a '.ps1' extension. Specify a valid PowerShell script file name, and then try again.
