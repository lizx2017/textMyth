Summary:
Make bootstrap retry
Description:
We ran into a situation where we had rpc_timeout set to 1 second, and the node needing to compute the token took over a second (1.6 seconds). The bootstrapping node hangs forever without getting a token because the expiring map removes it before the reply comes back.
