Summary:
Disabling hinted handoff counterintuitively continues to log handoff messages
Description:
In order to test a theory, we tried to disable hinted handoff on our cluster. We updated all of the yaml files and then restarted all the nodes in our cluster. However we continue to get messages such as this in the logs after restarting:
INFO [HintedHandoff:1] 2011-09-10 22:41:40,813 HintedHandOffManager.java (line 323) Started hinted handoff for endpoint /10.1.2.3

Also looking at the System.HintsColumnFamily in jmx there is activity there such as pending tasks that come and go.
