Summary:
Memtable flushwriter can pick a blacklisted directory
Description:
The top-level data directory will be picked by DiskAwareRunnable (directory = Directories.getLocationCapableOfSize(writeSize)), and the top-level data directory itself might not be blacklisted (most likely won't be).
For the same reason we can't just add a blacklist-check in the middle of Directories#getLocationCapableOfSize - most often it's the sstable directory that gets blacklisted.
The issue seems to be caused by/related to CASSANDRA-4292, which was committed just two days prior 2116-2118 and undid some blacklist-aware directory-picking logic.
Anyway, DiskAwareRunnable should be altered to respect directory blacklist.
