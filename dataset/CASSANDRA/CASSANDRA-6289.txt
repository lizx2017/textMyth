Summary:
Murmur3Partitioner doesn't yield proper ownership calculation
Description:
In a new 1.2 install with Murmur3 as default, I setup a test cluster with N=RF=3 for the cluster size and RF for a keyspace
but when I look at the ring output (with the keyspace name), to my surprise it shows RF=2.
Further investigate shows the "total replica" is an addition of the float value from the effectiveOwnership. But that results in < 1 for the setup:
#bean is set to org.apache.cassandra.db:type=StorageService
$>run effectiveOwnership Keyspace1
#calling operation effectiveOwnership of mbean org.apache.cassandra.db:type=StorageService
#operation returns:
{
/127.0.0.1 = 0.9999989;
/127.0.0.2 = 0.9999989;
/127.0.0.3 = 0.9999989;
}
$ ./bin/nodetool -h 0 -p 7100 ring Keyspace1

The println would simply class the float value to int, so i guess that's round down.
When using RandomPartitioner, the effectiveOwnership will return 1.0
So I guess the real question is, is the Murmur3 calculation correct? Or is it losing precision? If it is correct, then I guess we need to force the float -> int to round up? (is that even the right thing to do?)
