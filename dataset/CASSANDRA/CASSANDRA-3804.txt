Summary:
upgrade problems from 1.0 to trunk
Description:
A 3-node cluster is on version 0.8.9, 1.0.6, or 1.0.7 and then one and only one node is taken down, upgraded to trunk, and started again. An rpc timeout exception happens if counter-add operations are done. It usually takes between 1 and 500 add operations before the failure occurs. The failure seems to happen sooner if the coordinator node is NOT the one that was upgraded. Here is the error:
======================================================================
ERROR: counter_upgrade_test.TestCounterUpgrade.counter_upgrade_test
