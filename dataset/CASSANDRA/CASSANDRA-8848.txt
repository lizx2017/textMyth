Summary:
Protocol exceptions always use streamID 0
Description:
When decoding the binary protocol if a ProtocolException is thrown the streamID the request came in on is lost. This makes it very hard for drivers to correctly handle improper protocol implementations.
Included is a test case which sends a frame with version 0x82 and op 0x9 which should return a ProtocolError indicating that PREPARE should be a client Request not a response.
