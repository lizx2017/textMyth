Summary:
Prepared marker for collections inside UDT are not properly handled
Description:
Collections inside UDT needs to be encoded with the v3 protocol. However, we allow to prepare queries like:
INSERT INTO foo (k, v) VALUES (0, { s: ? });
In that case, if s is a collection, a client driver will only know that a collection is expected for that prepared variable, but it will have no way to know for sure that this collection is really part of a UDTValue. So we should handle this server side (i.e. let the user send the collection encoded with the protocol v2, but re-encode it properly).
