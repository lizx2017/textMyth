Summary:
shuffle broken on 2.0
Description:
In 1.2, shuffle works correctly, creating the list of relocations and then following it, pausing correctly as needed:
 WARN 20:45:58,153 Pausing until token count stabilizes (target=3, actual=4)
However on 2.0, it relocates all the ranges in one shot and never deletes entries from the list of tokens to relocate.
