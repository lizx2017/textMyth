Summary:
CLI "drop index" doesn't handle numeric-only hex column identifiers properly
Description:
CLI drop index doesn't accept requests to drop columns whose hex names include only numeric characters. The 617070 column name below is col2.
[default@Host] use MyKeyspace;
Authenticated to keyspace: MyKeyspace
[default@Host] drop index on MyCF.617070;
Syntax error at position 22: mismatched input '617070' expecting Identifier
While drop index seems to parse correctly with alpha chars included:
[default@Host] drop index on MyCF.617070x;
Column '617070x' definition was not found in ColumnFamily 'MyCF'.
[default@Host] drop index on MyCF.col2;
Column 'col2' definition was not found in ColumnFamily 'MyCF'.
