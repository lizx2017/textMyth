Summary:
index validation fails for non-indexed column
Description:
On 2.1.3, updates are failing with an InvalidRequestException when an unindexed column is greater than the maximum allowed for indexed entries.
ResponseError: Can't index column value of size 1483409 for index null on local_group_default_T_parsoid_html.data
In this case, the update does include a 1483409 byte column value, but it is for a column that is not indexed, (the single indexed column is < 32 bytes), presumably this is why cfm.getColumnDefinition(cell.name()).getIndexName() returns null.
