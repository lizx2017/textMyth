Summary:
Get rid of CFMetaData isPurged(), markPurged()
Description:
CASSANDRA-3578 added a new isPurged field to CFMetaData. It's only being used by CommitLogSegment.markDirty().
The linked patch removed the field and all the purge-related methods, replacing that condition with !Schema.instance.hasCF().
That said, I'm not sure that the check makes sense at all, with CASSANDRA-5202.
