Summary:
Infinite loop in StreamReader.read during exception condition while running repair
Description:
InputStream.skip is returning -1 during exception conditions which leads the following logic to infinite loop:
loop
protected void drain(InputStream dis, long bytesRead) throws IOException
{
    long toSkip = totalSize() - bytesRead;
    toSkip = toSkip - dis.skip(toSkip);
    while (toSkip > 0)
        toSkip = toSkip - dis.skip(toSkip);
}
