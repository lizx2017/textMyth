Summary:
add an escapeSQLString function and fix unescapeSQLString
Description:
CliUtils.unescapeSqlString repeats the escape character e.g.
"my \\t tab" becomes "my \tt"
because i is not bumped when an escape is processed.
Also for Cassandra-2221 I need a function to escape strings back so they will work if processed by the cli again.
There are a number of non standard escapes which I assume is a hang over from is original source https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/1aeca2b6257b0ad6680080b1756edf7ee9acf8c8/src/java/org/apache/cassandra/cli/CliUtils.java
Will change to use the StringEscapeUtils class
