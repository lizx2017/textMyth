Summary:
Fix CollationController#collectTimeOrderedData() mostRecentRowTombstone tracking
Description:
As of now, collectTimeOrderedData() will try to read from at least one sstable, even if the memtable has a row tombstone with a higher timestamp than any max timestamp in the sstable. If we initiate mostRecentRowTombstone with the value from the memtables and not Long.MIN_VALUE, reading from the sstables can be avoided entirely in this scenario.
Current tracking is also broken b/c we update mostRecentRowTombstone value with the one read from the last sstable, unconditionally, even if it's a lesser tombstone than we used to have tracked.
