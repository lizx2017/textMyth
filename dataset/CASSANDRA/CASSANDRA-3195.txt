Summary:
Cassandra-CLI does not allow "Config" as column family name
Description:
"create column family Config" does not work, "create column family Configg" does.
I suppose the intent is that column families can be named freely, that they have a namespace completely of their own, and separate from, say, Cassandra-CLI commands.
