Summary:
Make StreamReceiveTask thread safe and GC friendly
Description:
StreamReceiveTask is not thread safe when stream session is aborted and completion task is running.
Also, StreamReceiveTask keeps references to SSTableWriter until completion task runs and session completes. Currently, StreamReceiveTask's completion task runs on StorageService's NonPeriodicTask and it may take longer to execute.
Patch attached to fix above.
