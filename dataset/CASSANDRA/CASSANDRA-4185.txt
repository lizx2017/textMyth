Summary:
Minor CQL3 fixes
Description:
The goal of this ticket is to be the home for a number of minor fixes/improvements in CQL3 that I didn't felt warranted a ticket each. It includes 4 patches:
The first one fixes the grammar for float constants, so as to not recognize 3.-3, but to actually allow 3. (i.e, with radix point but with the fractional part left blank)
The second one correctly detect the (invalid) case where a table is created with COMPACT STORAGE but without any 'clustering keys'.
The third one fixes COUNT, first by making sure both COUNT and COUNT(1) are correctly recognized and also by "processing" the internal row before counting, are there isn't a 1-to-1 correspondence between internal rows and CQL rows in CQL3. The grammar change in this patch actually rely on CASSANDRA-4184
The fourth and last patch disallows the counter type for keys (i.e. any column part of the PRIMARY KEY) as it is completely non-sensical and will only led to confusion.
