Summary:
Nodetool Status performance is much slower with VNodes On
Description:
Nodetool status on a 1000 Node cluster without vnodes returns in several seconds. With vnodes on (256) there are OOM errors with the default XMX of 32. Adjusting the XMX to 128 allows nodetool status to complete but the execution takes roughly 10 minutes.
Tested
XMX    |      Status
32     |    OOM
64     |    OOM: GC Overhead
128    |    Finishes in ~10 minutes
500    |    Finishes in ~10 minutes
1000   |    Finishes in ~10 minutes
