Summary:
NPE in net.OutputTcpConnection when tracing is enabled
Description:
I get multiple NullPointerException when trying to trace INSERT statements.
To reproduce:
$ ccm create -v git:trunk
$ ccm populate -n 3
$ ccm start
$ ccm node1 cqlsh < 5668_npe_ddl.cql
$ ccm node1 cqlsh < 5668_npe_insert.cql
And see many exceptions like this in the logs of node1:
ERROR [WRITE-/127.0.0.3] 2013-06-19 14:54:35,885 OutboundTcpConnection.java (line 197) error writing to /127.0.0.3
java.lang.NullPointerException
        at org.apache.cassandra.net.OutboundTcpConnection.writeConnected(OutboundTcpConnection.java:182)
        at org.apache.cassandra.net.OutboundTcpConnection.run(OutboundTcpConnection.java:144)
This is similar to CASSANDRA-5658 and is the reason that npe_ddl and npe_insert are separate files.
