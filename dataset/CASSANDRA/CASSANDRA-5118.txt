Summary:
user defined compaction is broken
Description:
currently forceUserDefinedCompaction takes (keyspace, datafile)
cassandra tries to look for ks/ks-cf-hf-80-Data.db when the sstable actually exists at ks/cf/ks-cf-hf-80-Data.db
fix would be for user defined compaction to look for the sstable datafile in the correct location
