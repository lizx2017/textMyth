Summary:
nodetool ring throws exception if run on machine without Cassandra
Description:
DatabaseDescriptor.getNumTokens() is invoked in the nodetool ring command which doesn't work so well when running on a machine where Cassandra doesnt' exist. And it has all kind of side effects as well.
This seems fixed in 2.1 but would be nice if it was fixed in 2.0 as well.
