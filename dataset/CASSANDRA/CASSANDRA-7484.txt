Summary:
Throw exception on unknown UDT field
Description:
Currently, the following code:
CREATE TYPE foo (f : int);
CREATE TABLE test (k int PRIMARY KEY, v foo);

INSERT INTO test (k, v) VALUES (0, { s : ?})
will crash, because the s field is not part of type foo and it's not caught. The consequence being that the metadata for the bindMarker ends up being null and some NPE is thrown. We should throw a proper exception instead.
