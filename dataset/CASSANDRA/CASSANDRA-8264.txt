Summary:
Problems with multicolumn relations and COMPACT STORAGE
Description:
As discovered in CASSANDRA-7859, there are a few issues with multi-column relations and COMPACT STORAGE.
The first issue is that IN clauses on multiple columns aren't handled correctly. There appear to be other issues as well, but I haven't been able to dig into them yet. To reproduce the issues, run each of the tests in MultiColumnRelationTest with a COMPACT STORAGE version of the table. (Changing the tests to do that automatically will be part of the ticket.)
