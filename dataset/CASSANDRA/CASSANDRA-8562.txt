Summary:
Fix checking available disk space before compaction starts
Description:
When starting a compaction we check if there is enough disk space available to start it, otherwise we might (for STCS) reduce the compaction so that the result could fit. Now (since CASSANDRA-8329) we check for the directory to write to a lot later and this can reduce the compaction after we have created the scanners.
