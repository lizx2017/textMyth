Summary:
compactionstats reports incorrect byte values
Description:
The output of nodetool compactionstats (while a compaction is running) is incorrect.
The output from nodetool compactionhistory and the log both match and they disagree with the output from compactionstats.
What nodetool said during the compaction was almost certainly wrong given the sizes of files on disk:
completed total unit progress
144713163589 146631071165 bytes 98.69%
nodetool compactionhistory and the log both report the same values for that compaction:
52,596,321,269 bytes to 38,575,881,134
The compactionhistory/log values make much more sense given the size of the files on disk.
