Summary:
Missing logging for some exceptions
Description:
Since you are using ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor.schedule(), the exception was swallowed by the FutureTask.
You will have to perform a get() method on the ScheduledFuture, and you will get ExecutionException if there was any exception occured in run().
