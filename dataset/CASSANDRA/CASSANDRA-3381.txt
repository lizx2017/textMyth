Summary:
StorageProxy does not log correctly when schema is not in agreement
Description:
"logger.debug("%s disagrees (%s)", host, entry.getKey());"
that would literally log:
DEBUG [pool-2-thread-359] 2011-10-18 10:34:45,376 StorageProxy.java (line 821) %s disagrees (%s)
simple fix: replace with %s with {} ... may want to consider logging better comment?
