jmx org.apache.cassandra.net.FailureDetector.DownEndpointCount is 1
node 58.75 is absent in nodetool status and system.peers table.
Before node got LEFT status it was in REMOVING state.
I've done unsafeassassinateendpoint and it's status became LEFT, but DownEndpointCount is still 1.
And org.apache.cassandra.net.FailureDetector.SimpleStates is still DOWN.
How to remove this node from gossip?
