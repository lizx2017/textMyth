Summary:
Remove ref-counting of netty buffers
Description:
This has turned out to be more bug prone than we'd hoped, and it no longer seems to be a justified risk factor, since the performance gains were generally quite modest. When there's some time we can reengineer the API to make it safer to produce more obviously correct usage, but in the meantime I propose rolling back this change before general availability of 2.1
