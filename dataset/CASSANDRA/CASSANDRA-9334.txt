Summary:
Returning null from a trigger does not abort the write
Description:
The javadoc for ITrigger seems to indicate that returning null means no mutations for the write will be applied at all:
     * Called exactly once per CF update, returned mutations are atomically updated.
     *
     * @param key - Row Key for the update.
     * @param update - Update received for the CF
     * @return modifications to be applied, null if no action to be performed.
and indeed, TriggerExecutor.execute seems to have code for this:
        if (augmentedMutations == null)
            return null;
but it never fires. In testing with a trigger that always returns null, the original mutation is still applied.
