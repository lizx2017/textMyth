Summary:
Unbounded key range only ever scans first node in ring
Description:
        List<AbstractBounds> ranges = getRestrictedRanges(new Bounds(leftToken, p.getMinimumToken()));
when called with empty start key this means we have a Bounds(minToken, minToken), which hits the getRR special case
        // special case for bounds containing exactly 1 token
        if (queryRange instanceof Bounds && queryRange.left.equals(queryRange.right))
        {
            if (logger.isDebugEnabled())
                logger.debug("restricted single token match for query " + queryRange);
            return Collections.singletonList(queryRange);
        }
Looks like this broke as a side effect of CASSANDRA-1442. Prior to that a bounds from [T, minToken] was considered "up to infinity" by getRR so would span multiple nodes.
