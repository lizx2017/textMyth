Summary:
SSTableImportTest fails on Windows because of malformed file path
Description:
SSTableImportTest uses URL.getPath() to create path to JSON files. This fails on Windows in many cases (for example if there are spaces in path which get encoded as %20 which Windows doesn't like). Trick is to create URI from URL which satisfies all platforms.
