Summary:
Case sensitivity problem in cqlsh when specifying keyspace in select
Description:
The dtest cqlsh_tests.py:TestCqlsh.test_with_empty_values is currently failing. Upon investigation, the issue is a case sensitivity problem in cqlsh. If I have a keyspace, 'cassandra', the following queries all work:
use cassandra;
use CASSANDRA;
select * from cassandra.table;
The following query worked in 2.0 but does not work in cqlsh in 2.1:
select * from CASSANDRA.table
It should be noted that the final query also works when accessing C* through the python driver, so it should work in cqlsh.
