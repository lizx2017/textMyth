Summary:
AbstractQueryPager.DiscardFirst is still broken
Description:
See https://datastax-oss.atlassian.net/browse/JAVA-243 for an example failure.
This is my bad, I messed up while testing the fix for CASSANDRA-6447. Attaching fix for that. I've (correctly) tested that this fixes the issue but also added a few specific unit tests for discardFirst/discardLast to make sure they work correctly this time.
