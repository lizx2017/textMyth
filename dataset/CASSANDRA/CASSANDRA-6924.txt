Summary:
Data Inserted Immediately After Secondary Index Creation is not Indexed
Description:
The head of the cassandra-1.2 branch (currently 1.2.16-tentative) contains a regression from 1.2.15. Data that is inserted immediately after secondary index creation may never get indexed.
You can reproduce the issue with a pycassa integration test by running:
nosetests tests/test_autopacking.py:TestKeyValidators.test_get_indexed_slices
from the pycassa directory.
The operation order goes like this:
create CF
create secondary index
insert data
query secondary index
If a short sleep is added in between steps 2 and 3, the data gets indexed and the query is successful.
If a sleep is only added in between steps 3 and 4, some of the data is never indexed and the query will return incomplete results. This appears to be the case even if the sleep is relatively long (30s), which makes me think the data may never get indexed.
