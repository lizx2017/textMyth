Summary:
CLI: issue with keys being interpreted as hex and causing SET statement to fail
Description:
Original Summary: Issues with Update Column Family and adding a key_validation_class
Changed summary because the issue repros on drop/create. see comment.
Reproduction Steps
create column family users with comparator = UTF8Type 
and column_metadata = [{column_name: password, validation_class: UTF8Type}];

update column family users with key_validation_class=UTF8Type;

set users['jsmith']['password']='ch@ngem3';          
EXPECTED RESULT: After the UPDATE statement, the SET statement should go through successfully.
ACTUAL RESULT: The SET statement gives the same error message, regardless of the UPDATE statement:
org.apache.cassandra.db.marshal.MarshalException: cannot parse 'jsmith' as hex bytes
