Summary:
Memtable.maybeUpdateLiveRatio goes into an endless loop when currentOperations is zero
Description:
Hi,
I was describing an error the other day on the mailing list, where the MemoryMeter would go into an endless loop. This happened multiple times last week, unfortunetaly I cannot reproduce it at the moment.
The whole cassandra server got unresponsive and logged about 7000k messages per second into the log:
...
INFO [MemoryMeter:1] 2014-06-14 19:24:09,488 Memtable.java (line 481) CFS(Keyspace='MDS', ColumnFamily='ResponsePortal') liveRatio is 64.0 (just-counted was 64.0). calculation took 0ms for 0 cells
...
The cause for this seems to be Memtable.maybeUpdateLiveRatio(), which cannot handle currentOperations (and liveRatioComputedAt) to be zero. The loop will iterate endlessly:
            ...
            if (operations < 2 * last) // does never break when zero: 0 < 0 is not true
                break;
            ...
One thing I cannot explain: How can the operationcount be zero when maybeUpdateLiveRatio() gets called?
is it possible that addAndGet in resolve() increases by 0 in some cases?
currentOperations.addAndGet(cf.getColumnCount() + (cf.isMarkedForDelete() ? 1 : 0) + cf.deletionInfo().rangeCount()); // can this be zero? 
Nevertheless, the attached patch fixes the endless loop. Feel free to reassign this ticket or create a followup ticket if currentOperations should not be zero.
kind regards,
Christian
