Summary:
Internal c* datatypes exposed via jmx and method signatures changed in 2.1
Description:
In c* 2.0 the StorageService jmx has this signature:
public void forceKeyspaceCleanup 
but in 2.1 RC6 it is this
 
public CompactionManager.AllSSTableOpStatus forceKeyspaceCleanup
This makes any consumer have a problem with the unmarshalling and should be a native java type.
There may be further instances, the jmx api should probably be audited for similar instances.
