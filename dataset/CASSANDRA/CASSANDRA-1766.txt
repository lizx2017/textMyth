Summary:
Streaming never makes progress
Description:
I have a client that can never complete a bootstrap. AC finishes, streaming begins. Stream initiate completes, and the sources wait on the transfer to finish, but progress is never made on any stream. Nodetool reports streaming is happening, the socket is held open, but nothing happens.
