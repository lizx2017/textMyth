Summary:
Running sstableupgrade on C* 1.0 data dir, before starting C* 1.2 for the first time breaks stuff
Description:
If you try to upgrade from C* 1.0.X to 1.2.X and run offline sstableupgrade to try and migrate the sstables before starting 1.2.X for the first time, it messes up the system folder, because it doesn't migrate it right, and then C* 1.2 can't start.
sstableupgrade should either refuse to run against a C* 1.0 data folder, or migrate stuff the right way.
