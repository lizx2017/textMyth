Summary:
Max sstable size in leveled manifest is an int, creating large sstables overflows this and breaks LCS
Description:
nodetool compactionstats
pending tasks: -222222228
I can see negative numbers in 'pending tasks' on all 8 nodes
it looks like -222222228 + real number of pending tasks
for example -222222128 for 100 real pending tasks
