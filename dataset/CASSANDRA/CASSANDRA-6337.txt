Summary:
Set minTimestamp correctly to be able to drop expired sstables
Description:
When calculating which sstables we can drop we set minTimestamp to Integer.MAX_VALUE, this is wrong since minTimestamp is a long, and in most cases minTimestamp on sstables is larger than Integer.MAX_VALUE.
We should set it to Long.MAX_VALUE, patch does that.
