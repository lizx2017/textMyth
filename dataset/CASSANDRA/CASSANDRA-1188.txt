Summary:
multiget_slice calls do not close files resulting in file descriptor leak
Description:
Insert 1000 rows into a super column family. Read them back in a loop using multiget_slice. Note leaked file descriptors with lsof:
lsof -p `ps ax | grep [C]assandraDaemon | awk '
{print $1}
'` | awk '
{print $9}
' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | tail -n 5
Looks like SSTableNamesIterator is never closing the files it creates via the sstable ...?
This is similar to CASSANDRA-1178 except for use of multiget_slice instead of get_slice
