Summary:
IndexedSliceReader can skip columns when fetching multiple contiguous slices
Description:
This was observed using SliceQueryFilter with multiple slices.
Let's have a row "a" having the following column list : "colA", "colB", "colC", "colD"
Then select 2 ranges : ["colA", "colB"], ["colC", "colD"]
Expected result is the four columns
But only 3 are returned ("colA", "colB", "colD")
To reproduce the above scenario in the unit tests, you can modify the test "ColumnFamilyStoreTest.testMultiRangeIndexed" by replacing the original line :
String[] letters = new String[]
{ "a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i" }
;
by this one ("f" letter has been removed) :
String[] letters = new String[]
{ "a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "g", "h", "i" }
;
Anyway, a patch is attached which adds more unit tests, and modifies IndexedSliceReader.IndexedBlockFetcher & IndexedSliceReader.SimpleBlockFetcher
