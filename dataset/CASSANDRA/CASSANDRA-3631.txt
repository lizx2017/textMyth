Summary:
While sleeping for RING_DELAY, bootstrapping nodes do not show as joining in the ring (or at all)
Description:
As the title says, the nodes do not show in the ring until they are actually in the token selection/streaming phase. This appears due to CASSANDRA-957, but now can be further exacerbated by longer sleep times for CASSANDRA-3629.
