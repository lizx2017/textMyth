Summary:
Add SERIAL and LOCAL_SERIAL consistency levels to cqlsh
Description:
cqlsh does not support setting the serial consistency level. The default CL.SERIAL does not let users safely execute LWT alongside an app that runs at LOCAL_SERIAL, and can prevent any LWT from running when a DC is down (e.g. with 2 DCs, RF=3 in each.)
Implementing this well is a bit tricky. A user setting the serial CL will probably not want all of their statements to have a serial CL attached, but only the conditional updates. At the same time it would be useful to support serial reads. "WITH CONSISTENCY LEVEL" used to provide this flexibility.
I believe that it is currently impossible to run a SELECT at SERIAL or LOCAL_SERIAL; the only workaround seems to be to run a conditional update with a predicate that always resolves to False, and to rely on the CAS response to read the data.
