Summary:
cassandra-cli help output should mention the need for semicolons
Description:
When running cassandra-cli for the first time after upgrading beta3 -> rc1, I thought it was broken, because any command I typed ("?", "quit", "exit", "use system", etc) just printed some empty space and sat there until I killed it. I didn't know it was a continuation prompt, or that semicolons were needed.
The startup banner message currently says:
Connected to: "Test Cluster" on localhost/9160
Welcome to cassandra CLI.

Type 'help' or '?' for help. Type 'quit' or 'exit' to quit.
I believe that the example commands should have semicolons after them, to let the user know about the change.
Also, a "?" by itself should probably not require a semicolon.
