Summary:
get_paged_slices doesn't reset startColumn after first row
Description:
As an example, consider the WordCount example (see CASSANDRA-3883). WordCountSetup inserts 1000 rows, each with three columns: text3, text4, int1. (Some other miscellaneous columns are inserted in a few rows, but we can ignore them here.)
Paging through with get_paged_slice calls with a count of 99, CFRecordReader will first retrieve 33 rows, the last of which we will call K. Then it will attempt to fetch 99 more columns, starting with row K column text4.
The bug is that it will only fetch text4 for each subsequent row K+i, instead of returning (K, text4), (K+1, int1), (K+1, int3), (K+1, text4), etc.
