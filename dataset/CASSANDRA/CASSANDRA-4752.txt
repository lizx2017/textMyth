Summary:
Drop keyspace causes schema disagreement
Description:
The fix for CASSANDRA-4698 introduced a bug whereby when drop keyspace is issued a schema disagreement immediately occurs. This seems to be because the
ColumnFamily cf = ColumnFamily.create(modification.getValue().metadata());
in RowMutation.deserializeFixingTimestamps does not preserve deletion info for the cf in the modification. In most cases, this doesn't cause a problem, but for a drop keyspace modification, there are no columns in the cf, so the deletion info is effectively lost leading to an incorrect digest being created and ultimately a schema disagreement.
Replacing the create with cloneMeShallow does preserve the deletion info and avoids the schema disagreement issue.
