Summary:
o.a.c.dht.AbstractBounds missing serialVersionUID
Description:
o.a.c.dht.AbstractBounds does not have a serialVersionUID set, and as a result, tools that make use of getRangeToEndpointMap() on the StorageService mbean must be from the exact same build or they fail with an java.io.InvalidClassException. This is very inconvenient.
