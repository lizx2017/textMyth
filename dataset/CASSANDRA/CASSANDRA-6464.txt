Summary:
Paging queries with IN on the partition key is broken
Description:
Feels like MultiPartitionPager (which handles paging queries when there is a IN on the partition key) has completely missed CASSANDRA-5714's train. As a result, it completely broken and will typically loop infinitely.
Attaching patch to fix.
