Summary:
Explicitly examine current C* state on startup to detect incompatibilities before upgrade
Description:
Unfortunately, we cannot rely on users reading, and following, NEWS.txt before upgrading. People don't read, or ignore it, and sometimes have issues as the result (see CASSANDRA-8047, for example, and I know of several cases like that one).
We should add an explicit compatibility check on startup, before we modify anything, or write out sstables with the new format. We should fail and complain loudly if we detect a skipped upgrade step.
We should also snapshot the schema tables before attempting any conversions (since it's not uncommon to make schema modifications as part of the upgrade).
