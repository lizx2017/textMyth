Summary:
OOMs because delete operations are not accounted
Description:
Currently we are moving to new data format where new format is written into new CFs and old one is deleted key-by-key.
I have started getting OOMs and found out that delete operations are not accounted and so, column families are not flushed (changed == 0 with delete only operations) by storage manager.
This is pull request that fixed this problem for me: https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/5
