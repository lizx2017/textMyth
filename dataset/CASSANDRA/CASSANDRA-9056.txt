Summary:
Tombstoned SSTables are not removed past max_sstable_age_days when using DTCS
Description:
When using DTCS, tombstoned sstables past max_sstable_age_days are not removed by minor compactions. I was able to reproduce this manually and also wrote a dtest (currently failing) which reproduces this issue: dtcs_deletion_test in compaction_test.py. I tried applying the patch in CASSANDRA-8359 but found that the test still fails with the same issue.
