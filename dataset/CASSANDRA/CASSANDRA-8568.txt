Summary:
Extend Transactional API to sstable lifecycle management
Description:
DataTracker has become a bit of a quagmire, and not at all obvious to interface with, with many subtly different modifiers. I suspect it is still subtly broken, especially around error recovery.
I propose piggy-backing on CASSANDRA-7705 to offer RAII (and GC-enforced, for those situations where a try/finally block isn't possible) objects that have transactional behaviour, and with few simple declarative methods that can be composed simply to provide all of the functionality we currently need.
See CASSANDRA-8399 for context
