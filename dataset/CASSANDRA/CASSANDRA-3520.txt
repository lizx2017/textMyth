Summary:
Unit test are hanging on 0.8 branch
Description:
As the summary says, the unit test on current 0.8 are just hanging after CliTest (it's apparently not the case on windows, but it is on Linux and MacOSX).
Not sure what's going on, but what I can tell is that it's enough to run CliTest to have it hang after the test successfully pass (i.e, JUnit just wait indefinitely for the VM to exit). Even weirder, it seems that it is the counter increment in the CliTest that make it hang, if you comment those statement, it stop hanging. However, nothing seems to go wrong with the increment itself (the test passes) and it doesn't even trigger anything (typically sendToHintedEndpoint is not called because there is only one node).
Looking at the stack when the VM is hanging (attached), there is nothing specific to counters in there, and nothing that struck me at odd (but I could miss something). There do is a few thrift thread running (CASSANDRA-3335), but why would that only be a problem for the tests in that situation is a mystery to me.
