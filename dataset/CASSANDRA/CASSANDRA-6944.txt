Summary:
liveRatio jumps to max when Memtable is empty
Description:
liveRatio calculation on an empty memtable results in a value of Infinity since memtable.currentSize=0. Infinity then gets capped at the liveRatio max of 64.
WARN [MemoryMeter:1] 2014-03-19 09:26:59,483 Memtable.java (line 441) setting live ratio to maximum of 64.0 instead of Infinity
INFO [MemoryMeter:1] 2014-03-19 09:26:59,485 Memtable.java (line 452) CFS(Keyspace='system', ColumnFamily='compactions_in_progress') liveRatio is 64.0 (just-counted was 64.0).  calculation took 7ms for 0 cells
Jumping liveRatio to the max value based on an empty Memtable leads to more frequent flushing than may be necessary.
