Summary:
Gossip conviction threshold too low
Description:
The current gossip conviction threshold is a bit too low, and can cause hosts to 'flap' under heavy load. I suspect that the original author of the failure detector implementation originally used both suspect and convict, but at some point decided that there was no action to take when a host was suspected, or that it was not worth doing. They appear to have short-circuited the code to convict on suspect to eliminate this, however this caused the suspicion threshold (5) to be used for convicting hosts instead of the conviction threshold (8).
