Summary:
Gossiper convicts same node over and over.
Description:
I can reproduce this in trunk or 0.5. It is quite easy to see with logging set to DEBUG.
1. Bring up several nodes.
2. Kill one of them.
Gossip still continues to examine the failed node because it is in the ring, but gets convicted over and over at every check (see FailureDetector.interpret). If this is expected, we should consider lowering the debug statement in MessagingService.convict to TRACE.
