Summary:
SystemKeyspaceTest fails with non-release version string
Description:
SystemKeyspaceTest#snapshotSystemKeyspaceIfUpgrading is currently failing on the 2.2 branch because the build version 2.2.0-beta1-SNAPSHOT cannot be parsed as a SemanticVersion. This is only a problem with the test, as the code under test doesn't actually use SemanticVersion, it just checks whether the old & new version strings are different.
