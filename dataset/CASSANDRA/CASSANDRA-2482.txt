Summary:
Make compaction type an enum
Description:
Compaction type should be an enum, half of the places we set it we use it as a message and include the keyspace/cf although that is already included in the compaction info object.
I realize this is minor and a pedantic but from the standpoint of someone writing a monitoring application its kind of annoying.
