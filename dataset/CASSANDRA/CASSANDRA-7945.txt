Summary:
new cassanrda-stress does not work with NetworkTopologyStrategy
Description:
$ cassandra-stress write -schema 'replication(strategy=NetworkTopologyStrategy,DC1=2,DC2=1)'
prints error:
Unable to create stress keyspace: Error constructing replication strategy class
Looks like it is caused by passing 'replication_factor' to NTS, which is illegal option for NTS.
