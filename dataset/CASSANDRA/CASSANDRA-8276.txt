Summary:
Duplicate values in an IN restriction on the partition key column can break paging
Description:
We had an issue (JAVA-515) in the java-driver when the number of parameters in a statement is greater than the supported limit (65k).
I added a limit-test to verify that prepared statements with 65535 parameters were accepted by the driver, but ran into an issue on the Cassandra side.
Basically, the test runs forever, because the driver receives an inconsistent answer from Cassandra. When we prepare the statement, C* answers that it is correctly prepared, however when we try to execute it, we receive a UNPREPARED answer.
Here is the code to reproduce the issue.
