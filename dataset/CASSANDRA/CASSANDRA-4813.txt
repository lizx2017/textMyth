Summary:
Problem using BulkOutputFormat while streaming several SSTables simultaneously from a given node.
Description:
The issue occurs when streaming simultaneously SSTables from the same node to a cassandra cluster using SSTableloader. It seems to me that Cassandra cannot handle receiving simultaneously SSTables from the same node. However, when it receives simultaneously SSTables from two different nodes, everything works fine. As a consequence, when using BulkOutputFormat to generate SSTables and stream them to a cassandra cluster, I cannot use more than one reducer per node otherwise I get a java.io.EOFException in the tasktracker's logs and a java.io.IOException: Broken pipe in the Cassandra logs.
