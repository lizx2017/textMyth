Summary:
cqlsh on 2.0 adds invalid parameters to LeveledCompactionStrategy DESCRIBE output
Description:
This bug is the same behavior as CASSANDRA-9064, but happens for a different reason. On 2.1, 2.2, and trunk, it was fixed by changes to the Python driver, but cqlsh works differently on 2.0, so the incorrect behavior is still there.
