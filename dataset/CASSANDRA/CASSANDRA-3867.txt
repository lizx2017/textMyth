Summary:
Disablethrift and Enablethrift can leaves behind zombie connections on THSHA server
Description:
While doing nodetool disable thrift we disable selecting threads and close them... but the connections are still active...
Enable thrift creates a new Selector threads because we create new ThriftServer() which will cause the old connections to be zombies.
I think the right fix will be to call server.interrupt(); and then close the connections when they are done selecting.
