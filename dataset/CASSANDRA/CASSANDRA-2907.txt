Summary:
durable_writes flag cannot be changed via the CLI (system does not process KsDef.durable_writes option properly).
Description:
I am unable to change the durable_writes option in the CLI. Here are the commands to replicate the problem on a clean install:
create keyspace test;
update keyspace test with durable_writes=false;
show keyspaces;
It will still say:
Keyspace: test:
Replication Strategy: org.apache.cassandra.locator.NetworkTopologyStrategy
Durable Writes: true
Options: [datacenter1:1]
Column Families:
PS: I looked in the tests of the CLI code of CASSANDRA-2683 and saw that the feature actually is not properly tested: the flag is set, but never tested.
