Summary:
Scrub could lose increments and replicate that loss
Description:
If scrub cannot 'repair' a corrupted row, it will skip it. On node A, if the row contains some sub-count for A id, those will be lost forever since A is the source of truth on it's current id. We should thus renew node A id when that happens to avoid this (not unlike we do in cleanup).
