Summary:
half open tcp connections to cassandra cluster nodes cause 100% cpu load
Description:
cassandra 2.1.5
We spotted that few of the nodes in our cluster got sudden cpu 100% spike which never ended. It's not a GC and not increased reads/writes nodes.
What we saw is that those nodes that have 100% cpu load
all have some connections (file descriptios) with "can't identify protocol"
which indicate those must be unprolery handled abrupt connections by cassandra process.

We are pretty sure what triggered this is the spark cassandra connector
which sudenly started to get stuck in early discovery of cassandra nodes before running any stages
We had to restart the affected cassandra processes to get the cpu back to normal
ps. we had similar issues some time ago with earlier version, of 2.1.x cassandra branch, and ended up solving the problerm by upgrading from spark1.2.1 to spark1.3.1 and also upgrading spark datastax connecor accordingly. Now looks like the problem is back with 99.9% same symptoms
ps2. We have observed previously several java/cassandra unrelated processes (mainly in php-cli) go crazy with cpu then they had "can't identify protocol" symphoms
