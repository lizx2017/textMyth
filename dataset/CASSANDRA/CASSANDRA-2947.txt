Summary:
New nodes always think dead nodes are alive
Description:
If a new node is brought up while a node is down, it will think it is up forever.
To reproduce:
Take nodes A, B and C.
1. Bring up nodes A and B in a cluster
2. Take down B and wait for A to mark it as down
3. Bring up C with A as a seed
4. nodetool ring on C shows all 3 nodes as up and never marks B as down
The problem is that the failure detector never learns about node B - FD.report is never called for B. This means requests are constantly routed to B from C and timeout, but they should fail with UnavailableException.
The attached (hack) patch appears to fix it, but I expect the problem is actually elsewhere in the gossip code.
