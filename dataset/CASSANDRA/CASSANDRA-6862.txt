Summary:
Schema versions mismatch on large ring
Description:
We have a large cluster with several hundreds nodes in 1 ring. Sometimes, especially after massive restarts, schema versions reported on different nodes mismatch.
Investigated and found, that difference is not in schema itsself, but in thombstones (different nodes have different set of thombstones applied to system tables).
Fixed by digesting schema with thombstones removed first.
