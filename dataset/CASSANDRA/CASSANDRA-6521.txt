Summary:
Thrift should validate SliceRange start and finish lengths
Description:
To quote Ben Bromhead:
It appears that Cassandra does not check the length of a column name that is part of a range predicate for a *_slice query before it serialises the slice query to pass to the replicas. Names with a length greater than 0xFFFF cause an assertion error to occur in ByteBufferUtil.writeWithShortLength. This further causes subsequent reads on the node to fail until Cassandra is restarted
