Summary:
Node refuses to start with exception in ColumnFamilyStore.removeUnfinishedCompactionLeftovers when find that some to be removed files are already removed
Description:
Node refuses to start with
Caused by: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Unfinished compactions reference missing sstables. This should never happen since compactions are marked finished before we start removing the old sstables.
      at org.apache.cassandra.db.ColumnFamilyStore.removeUnfinishedCompactionLeftovers(ColumnFamilyStore.java:544)
      at org.apache.cassandra.service.CassandraDaemon.setup(CassandraDaemon.java:262)
IMO, there is no reason to refuse to start discivering files that must be removed are already removed. It looks like pure bug diagnostic code and mean nothing to operator (nor he can do anything about this).
Replaced throw of excepion with dump of diagnostic warning and continue startup.
