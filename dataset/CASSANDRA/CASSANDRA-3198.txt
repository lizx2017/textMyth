Summary:
debian packaging installation problem when installing for the first time
Description:
when installing cassandra through the debian packaging for the first time, there is permission problem when starting Cassandra.
Normally, the postinst script change owner of /var/log/cassandra and /var/lib/cassandra from root to cassandra user.
there is a problem with the test which verify if threre is a need to change the owner of these directory or not.
On a new install, the $2 parameter is not set and the the test is false and the owner is not changed.
(simply, i think replace "&&" with "||" might work)
