Summary:
binary protocol: when an invalid event type is watched via a REGISTER message, the response message does not have an associated stream id
Description:
I tried sending a REGISTER message with an eventlist including the string "STATUS_FOO", in order to test error handling in the python driver for that eventuality. But the response from the server (a "Server error" with a message of "java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: No enum const class org.apache.cassandra.transport.Event$Type.STATUS_FOO") had a stream_id of 0, so the driver was not able to associate it with the request.
