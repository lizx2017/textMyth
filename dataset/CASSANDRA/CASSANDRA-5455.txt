Summary:
Remove PBSPredictor
Description:
It was a fun experiment, but it's unmaintained and the bar to understanding what is going on is high. Case in point: PBSTest has been failing intermittently for some time now, possibly even since it was created. Or possibly not and it was a regression from a refactoring we did. Who knows?
