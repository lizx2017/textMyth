Summary:
StorageServiceClientTest/RecoveryManager2Test fail on 1.2.0 and above branch
Description:
Looks like change in c4cca2d8bba20a7651b956e1893727391bf5f10a (store schema_version to system.local) broke both StorageServiceClientTest and RecoveryManager2Test.
StorageServiceClientTest assert data directories are not created in client mode but this change actually creates data directories. RecoveryManager2Test fails with "junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: Expecting only 1 replayed mutation, got 10" error and I think extra commit log also comes from this insert to system.local.
