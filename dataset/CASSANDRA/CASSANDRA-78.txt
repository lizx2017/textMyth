Summary:
Interrupted recovery requires manual intervention to fix
Description:
Originally reported by Alexander Staubo: "If you kill the server while it is going through its initial "row recovery" phase, you risk ending up with a database that's corrupt and will fail with "negative seek" exceptions and similar."
Prashant replied:
"The commit logs are only deleted after a successful recovery. You should still have teh commit log if u killed the server while recovering ? When u restart the server it should generate a new file , for compactions we name intermediate files with a .tmp and only on successful dump do we place them as usable files , this same logic is required at recovery and there is a fix coming up which will do it .
"So with the state that u have today there will be no data loss ass commit logs still exist but its a round about process to recover it since now u haave to delete the intermediate file and then do teh recovery again."
