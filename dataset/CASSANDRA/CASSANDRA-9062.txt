Summary:
Investigate failing collection indexing dtests
Description:
There are frequent failures with the dtests related to indexing collections (secondary_indexes_test.py:TestSecondaryIndexesOnCollections).
I tried to look into the reason for failure. The test does seem to be correct, because it can occasionally pass. It seems like the failures are due to indexing lagging behind the inserts, resulting in a partial set of results when the index is queried shortly afterwards (getting ~20k matching rows instead of the expected 50k).
