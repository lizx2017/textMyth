Summary:
support starting an avro enabled node (experimental)
Description:
The start script should support a "-a" argument to make it possible to start an Avro enabled node. If/when Avro becomes a suitable replacement, the -a option can be dropped in favor of a -t option (as Avro becomes the deafult), which in turn can be dropped after Thrift is removed entirely.
The ThriftAddress and ThriftPort directives should also renamed to RPCAddress and RPCPort so that they can serve both RPC mechanism without creating confusion.
Patches to follow.
