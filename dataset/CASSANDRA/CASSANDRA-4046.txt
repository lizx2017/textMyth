Summary:
when creating keyspace with simple strategy, it should only acception "replication_factor" as an option
Description:
currently I could do this:
[default@unknown] create keyspace test
... with placement_strategy = 'SimpleStrategy'
... and strategy_options = {DC : testdc, replication_factor :1};
ebc5f430-6d47-11e1-0000-edee3ea2cbff
Waiting for schema agreement...
... schemas agree across the cluster
[default@unknown]
while i don't think this creates any "problem" in terms of the actual replication being used for the CL , we probably should acknowledge to the user that "DC : testdc" is not an valid option for the SimpleStrategy.
