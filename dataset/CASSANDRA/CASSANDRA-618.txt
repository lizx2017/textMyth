Summary:
json2sstable/sstable2json don't export/import correct column names when the column family is of BytesType ordering
Description:
Easy to reproduce.
1- start with an empty node.
2- run: client.insert("Keyspace1",
key_user_id,
new ColumnPath("Standard1", null, "name".getBytes("UTF-8")),
"Ramzi".getBytes("UTF-8"),
timestamp,
ConsistencyLevel.ONE)
3- flush to get sstable
4- sstable2json and export the sstable to a file
5- delete sstable
6- json2sstable and import the json into a new sstable.
7- sstable2json on new sstable, you will see that the name is different than the name in the original json file.
Also do a get on the column and it will return no result.
