Summary:
LOCAL_SERIAL use QUORUM consistency level to validate expected columns
Description:
If CAS is done at LOCAL_SERIAL consistency level, only the nodes from the local data center should be involved.
Here we are using QUORAM to validate the expected columns. This will require nodes from more than one DC.
We should use LOCAL_QUORAM here when CAS is done at LOCAL_SERIAL.
Also if we have 2 DCs with DC1:3,DC2:3, a single DC down will cause CAS to not work even for LOCAL_SERIAL.
