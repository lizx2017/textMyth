Summary:
cqlsh: DESCRIBE KEYSPACE should order types according to cross-type dependencies
Description:
Since UDTs may use other UDTs for fields, DESCRIBE KEYSPACE should list types in an order that handles the dependencies. This was recently done in the python driver here: https://github.com/datastax/python-driver/pull/165. We can either update to the latest python driver, or copy that code for cqlsh.
