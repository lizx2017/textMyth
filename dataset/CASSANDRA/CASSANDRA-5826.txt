Summary:
Fix trigger directory detection code
Description:
At least when building from source, Cassandra determines the trigger directory wrong. C* calculates the trigger directory as 'build/triggers' instead of 'triggers'.
FBUtilities.cassandraHomeDir() is to blame, and should be replaced with something more robust.
