Summary:
Can't insert only a key in CQL3
Description:
The following should work but well, doesnt:
cqlsh:k> CREATE TABLE t (k int PRIMARY KEY, v int);
cqlsh:k> INSERT INTO t (k) VALUES (0);
Bad Request: line 1:27 required (...)+ loop did not match anything at input ')'
The reason is just that the parser for INSERT has never been updated from the time where providing only a key was illegal.
