Summary:
Consider removing user types rename for now
Description:
When adding user types we've added the ability to do type renames. And while this kind of work, I'm starting to think that this will be hard to handle by clients drivers, especially since we can't really have a "type renamed" notification easily since internally we really handle the renaming as a drop + a add + a bunch of updates to the tables that were mentioning the type.
Besides, it feels like a bad idea in general to rename a type once it's been used in some tables (and if it's not used yet, then it's easy to drop and recreate with the new name).
So since 2.1 is not out yet, I would suggest that maybe it's wiser to remove type renaming for now, which doesn't at all preclude re-evaluating this a tad later when we have a little more experience with user types (and have a little more data point on whether this could actually be more useful than harmful).
