Summary:
NPE on startup if another Cassandra instance is already running
Description:
After CASSANDRA-7087, if you try to start cassandra while another instance is already running, you'll see something like this:
$ bin/cassandra -f
Error: Exception thrown by the agent : java.lang.NullPointerException
This is probably a JVM bug, but we should confirm that, open a JVM ticket, and see if we can give a more useful error message on the C* side.
