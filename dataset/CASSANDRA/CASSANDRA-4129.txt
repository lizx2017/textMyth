Summary:
Cannot create keyspace with specific keywords through cli
Description:
Keyspaces cannot be create when the keyspace name which are used as keywords in the cli, such as 'keyspace', 'family' etc., through CLI. Even when surrounding the keyspace with quotation does not solve the problem. However, such keyspaces can be created through other client such as Hector.
This is similar to the issue CASSANDRA-3195, in which the column families could not be created. Similar to the solution of CASSANDRA-3195, using String keyspaceName = CliUtil.unescapeSQLString(statement.getChild(0).getText()) in executeAddKeySpace would solve the problem.
