Summary:
Replaying archived commitlogs isn't working
Description:
I have a test for restoring archived commitlogs, which is not working in 2.1 HEAD. My commitlogs consist of 30,000 inserts, but system.log indicates there were only 2 mutations replayed:
INFO  [main] 2014-04-02 11:49:54,173 CommitLog.java:115 - Log replay complete, 2 replayed mutations
There are several warnings in the logs about bad headers and invalid CRCs:
WARN  [main] 2014-04-02 11:49:54,156 CommitLogReplayer.java:138 - Encountered bad header at position 0 of commit log /tmp/dtest
-mZIlPE/test/node1/commitlogs/CommitLog-4-1396453793570.log, with invalid CRC. The end of segment marker should be zero.
compare that to the same test run on 2.0, where it replayed many more mutations:
 INFO [main] 2014-04-02 11:49:04,673 CommitLog.java (line 132) Log replay complete, 35960 replayed mutations
I'll attach the system logs for reference.
Here is the dtest to reproduce this - (This currently relies on the fix for snapshots available in CASSANDRA-6965.)
