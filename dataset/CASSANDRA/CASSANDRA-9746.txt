Summary:
Fix PartitionUpdate.rowCount()
Description:
Depending on whether or not Mutation's {{PartitionUpdate}}s get iterated over before applying (iterated manually, or by having the commit log iterate over them for serialization), the subsequent reads may fail.
A follow up to CASSANDRA-9743, reusing the same (but properly named) test now: https://gist.github.com/iamaleksey/ed55a1f38a8869c2e229
