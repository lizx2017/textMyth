Summary:
A positive value of row_cache_save_period is needed to enable row cache
Description:
When the setting for row_cache_save_period is 0, the value specified for row_cache_size_in_mb is not utilized.
The cassandra version with which this behavior has been observed is:
adminuser@Ubuntu1:~$ nodetool version
ReleaseVersion: 1.2.13.2
To replicate
1) Stop dse;
2) Edit the cassandra.yaml file, setting the value of the row_cache_size_in_mb to be a nonzero value;
3) Start dse;
4) Run the 'nodetool info' command and observe the following line in the output:
Row Cache : size 0 (bytes), capacity 0 (bytes), 0 hits, 0 requests, NaN recent hit rate, 0 save period in seconds.
The expected behavior is that the value of the capacity parameter in the "Row Cache" row of the above nodetool output would report the setting for row_cache_size_in_mb. If the value of row_cache_save_period is set to a positive value, the nodetool output correctly reports the capacity as the value for the row_cache_size_in_mb parameter.
