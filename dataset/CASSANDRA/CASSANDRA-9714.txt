Summary:
sstableloader appears to use the cassandra.yaml outgoing stream throttle
Description:
When trying to use the sstableloader, we found (through the metrics in opscenter) that the stream throughput was constant at about 24MB/s. We didn't run it with the --throttle option so according to the help output and the BulkLoader code it should be unthrottled. However when it was unthrottled in the cassandra.yaml in the loader's classpath, it got up to the low hundreds of MB/s. It sounds like when starting up it takes the cassandra.yaml attributes and overrides the default throttle setting of the loader.
