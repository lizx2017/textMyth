Summary:
After a "short read", the wrong read command may be used
Description:
In fetchRows, there is this code:
    for (int i = 0; i < commandsToSend.size(); i++)
    {
        ReadCallback<Row> handler = readCallbacks.get(i);
        ReadCommand command = commands.get(i);
On the first iteration of fetchRows, commands == commandsToSend so this is ok, but on a short read, commandsToSend will only contain the command to retry so we'll pick up the wrong command on the last line.
