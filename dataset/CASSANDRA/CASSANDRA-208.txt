Summary:
OOM intermittently during compaction
Description:
jvm crashes intermittently during compaction. Our test data set is not that big, less than 10 GB.
When jvm is about to crash, we see that it consumes a lot of memory (exceeding the max heap size).
The excessive memory usage during compaction is caused by the maintenance of blockIndexes_ in SSTable. this blockIndexes_ was only introduced to the apache version.
