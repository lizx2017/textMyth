Summary:
(CQL3) Re-allow order by on non-selected columns
Description:
CASSANDRA-4612 added a limitation to ORDER BY query in that it requires the columns part of the ORDER BY to be in the select clause, while this wasn't the case previously.
The reason for that is that for ORDER BY with IN queries, the sorting is done post-query, and by the time we do the ordering, we've already cut down the result set to the select clause, so if the column are not in the select clause we cannot sort on them.
We should remove that that limitation however as this is a regression from what we had before. As far as 1.2.0 is concerned, at the very least we should lift the limitation for EQ queries since we don't do any post-query sorting in that case and that was working correctly pre-CASSANDRA-4612. But we should also remove that limitation for IN query, even if it's in a second time.
