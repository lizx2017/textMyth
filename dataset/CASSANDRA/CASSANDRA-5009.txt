Summary:
RangeStreamer has no way to report failures, allowing bootstrap/move etc to complete without data
Description:
It looks like we fixed this for 1.2 by having RS.fetch() throw, but in 1.1 it does not and there doesn't appear to be a way to detect an RS failure, which among other things will cause bootstrap to succeed even though it failed to fetch any data.
