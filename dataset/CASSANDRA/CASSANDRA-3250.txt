Summary:
fsync the directory after new sstable or commit log segment are created
Description:
The mannual of fsync said:
Calling fsync() does not necessarily ensure that the entry in the directory containing the file has also reached disk. For that an explicit fsync() on a file descriptor for the directory is also needed.
At least on ext4, syncing the directory is a must to have step, as described by [1]. Otherwise, the new sstables or commit logs could be missed after crash even if itself is synced.
Unfortunately, JVM does not provide an approach to sync the directory...
