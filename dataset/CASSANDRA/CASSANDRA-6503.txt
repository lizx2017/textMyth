Summary:
sstables from stalled repair sessions become live after a reboot and can resurrect deleted data
Description:
The sstables streamed in during a repair session don't become active until the session finishes. If something causes the repair session to hang for some reason, those sstables will hang around until the next reboot, and become active then. If you don't reboot for 3 months, this can cause data to resurrect, as GC grace has expired, so tombstones for the data in those sstables may have already been collected.
