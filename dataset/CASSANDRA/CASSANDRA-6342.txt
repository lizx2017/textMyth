Summary:
cassandra document errata
Description:
Hi
I think a sample cql statement of cassandra document (http://cassandra.apache.org/doc/cql3/CQL.html) is wrong. Please change it.
------------------------------------------------------
Note that TTLs are allowed for both INSERT and UPDATE, but in both case the TTL set only apply to the newly inserted/updated values. In other words,
// Updating (or inserting)
UPDATE users USING TTL 10 SET favs['color'] = 'green' WHERE id = 'jsmith'
will only apply the TTL to the
{ 'color' : 'green' }
record, the rest of the map remaining unaffected.
Deleting a map record is done with:
DELETE favs['author'] FROM plays WHERE id = 'jsmith'
upper DELETE cql statement is changed to below. On context of document, 'plays' table might be changed 'users' table.
DELETE favs['author'] FROM users WHERE id = 'jsmith'
