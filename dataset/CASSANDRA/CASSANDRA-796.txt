Summary:
binary artifacts need ivy for dependencies
Description:
Currently, if you generate a release, the binary artifact is missing required dependencies and the means to obtain them. The patch that follows a) copies build.xml and ivy.xml into the bin artifact and b) makes build.xml smart enough to tell when it's being run from a binary artifact.
This would also require updating all installation and quickstart documentation as well (the patch updates README.txt).
