Summary:
Make native Server start() method block until the server is properly bound
Description:
The native Server start() method returns before making sure the bind operation has succeeded, so the server might not be fully ready when it returns. It's not a big deal but it's slightly unexpected and I think that it's the cause of the intermittent failures of DeleteTest on jenkins.
