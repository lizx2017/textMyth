Summary:
when streaming sstables to other nodes, make sure they don't get compacted before they are streamed
Description:
at one point (pre-ASF codebase?) this was handled with a bootstrap data dir, but anticompaction no longer puts files there.
at this point it's probably easier to just make sure streaming keeps a reference to the sstable objects, which will keep them from being deleted.
