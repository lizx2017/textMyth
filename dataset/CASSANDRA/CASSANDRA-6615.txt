Summary:
Changing the IP of a node on a live cluster leaves gossip infos and throws Exceptions
Description:
Following this procedure : https://engineering.eventbrite.com/changing-the-ip-address-of-a-cassandra-node-with-auto_bootstrapfalse/ to change the IP of a node, we encountered an issue :
logs contains: "java.lang.RuntimeException: Host ID collision between active endpoint /127.0.0.5 and /127.0.0.3"
logs also indicate that the old IP is being removed of the cluster (FatClient timeout), then added again...
nodetool gossipinfo still list old IP (even a few hours after...)
the old IP is still seen as "UP" in the cluster... (according to the logs...)
Below is a small shell script which allows to reproduce the scenario...
#! /bin/bash

CLUSTER=$1
ccm create $CLUSTER --cassandra-dir=.
ccm populate -n 2
ccm start

ccm add node3 -i 127.0.0.3 -j 7300 -b
ccm node3 start
ccm node3 ring
ccm node3 stop

sed -i 's/127.0.0.3/127.0.0.5/g' ~/.ccm/$CLUSTER/node3/node.conf 
sed -i 's/127.0.0.3/127.0.0.5/g' ~/.ccm/$CLUSTER/node3/conf/cassandra.yaml

ccm node3 start
sleep 3
nodetool --host 127.0.0.5 --port 7300 gossipinfo
