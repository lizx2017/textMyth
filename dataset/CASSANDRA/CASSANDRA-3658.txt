Summary:
Fix smallish problems find by FindBugs
Description:
I've just run (the newly released) FindBugs 2 out of curiosity. Attaching a number of patches related to issue raised by it. There is nothing major at all so all patches are against trunk.
I've tried keep each issue to it's own patch with a self describing title. It far from covers all FindBugs alerts, but it's a picky tool so I've tried to address only what felt at least vaguely useful. Those are still mostly nits (only patch 2 is probably an actual bug).
