Summary:
"Unable to find property" errors from snakeyaml are confusing
Description:
When an unexpected property is present in cassandra.yaml (e.g. after upgrading), snakeyaml outputs the following message:
Unable to find property 'some_property' on class: org.apache.cassandra.config.Config
The error message is kind of counterintuitive because at first glance it seems to suggest the property is missing from the yaml file, when in fact the error is caused by the presence of an unrecognized property. I know if you read it carefully it says it can't find the property on the class, but this has confused more than one user.
I think we should catch this exception and wrap it in another exception that says something like this:
Please remove 'some_property' from your cassandra.yaml. It is not recognized by this version of Cassandra.
Also, it might make sense to make this a warning instead of a fatal error, and just ignore the unwanted property.
