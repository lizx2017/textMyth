Summary:
Log the disruptor server at ERROR like we do in 2.1
Description:
Since we updated to use the disruptor hsha server in 2.0, we need to change the package that logs we specify at level ERROR.
See CASSANDRA-6530 and particularly:
https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/cassandra-2.0/conf/log4j-server.properties#L43
versus
https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/cassandra-2.1/conf/logback.xml#L52
Also, do we want to log at FATAL?
