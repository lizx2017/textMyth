Summary:
List prepend reverses item order
Description:
If you prepend a list of items to a list collection, it will reverse the order of the prepend-list:
cqlsh:ks1> UPDATE foobar SET b = [2, 3] WHERE a = 0;
cqlsh:ks1> select * from foobar;

 a | b
---+--------
 0 | [2, 3]

(1 rows)
cqlsh:ks1> UPDATE foobar SET b = [0, 1] + b WHERE a = 0;
cqlsh:ks1> select * from foobar;

 a | b
---+--------------
 0 | [1, 0, 2, 3]

(1 rows)
This is because we're going through the prepend-list in a normal-order for-loop and prepending each time (in Lists.Prepender).
