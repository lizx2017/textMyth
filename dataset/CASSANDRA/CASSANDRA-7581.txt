Summary:
Stop read requests for partitions which don't belong to a node
Description:
A C* instance will serve CF level reads with null values or old values to a co-ordinator even if the instance is not responsible for the data.
This is bad if co-ordinator has a wrong view of the ring and will return wrong results back to the client.
A solution to this problem could be to not respond or return error to such read requests.
Tricky part here is to respond to read requests when the instance has just lost ownership for a few ring delay.
