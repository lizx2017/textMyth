Summary:
cfhistograms dtest flaps on trunk and 2.2
Description:
jmx_test.py:TestJMX.cfhistograms_test flaps on CassCI under trunk and 2.2.
On 2.2, it fails one of its assertions when 'Unable to compute when histogram overflowed' is found in the output of nodetool cfhistograms. Here's the failure history for 2.2:

On trunk, it fails when an error about a WriteFailureException during hinted handoff is found in the C* logs after the tests run (example cassci output). Here's the failure history for trunk:

I haven't seen it fail locally yet, but haven't run the test more than a couple times because it takes a while.
