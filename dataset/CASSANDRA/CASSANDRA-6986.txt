Summary:
snapshot fails with SSTable not found if table has already been restored
Description:
I seem to be running into a weird restore issue. I load a database with sstableloader, and then take a snapshot of the keyspace. I then truncate the tables in the keyspace, replace the sstables from the snapshot, and refresh everything. It seems to work fine. Of course the sstables get renumbered. I then try to create a new backup of the keyspace, and this happens on one of the tables on one of the nodes. (and the sstable has been renumbered): Exception in thread "main" java.lang.RuntimeException: Tried to hard link to file that does not exist /raid0/cassandra/data/stock/trades/stock-trades-jb-18-Data.db
