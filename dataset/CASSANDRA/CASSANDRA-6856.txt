Summary:
StorageProxy registers new instance with JMX not this instance
Description:
The StorageProxy uses the lovely singleton pattern. However JMX registers a new instance of StorageProxy class not the singleton. I am not sure the bug is outward facing but it someone were to add a class level variable inside the storage proxy and manipulate it through JMX then it would be exposed.
