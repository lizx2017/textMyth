Summary:
DatabaseDescriptor.defsVersion should be volatile
Description:
(Probably affects other versions, but I am on 0.7.3).
DatabaseDescriptor.defsVersion should be protected by volatile since it is written to and read by multiple threads from unsynchronized methods. This can manifest itself in schema agreement never occurring due to a node broadcasting the wrong schema version.
