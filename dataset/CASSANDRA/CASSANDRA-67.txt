Summary:
Review uses of FileStruct to make sure they are using decorated or raw keys correctly
Description:
Jun Rao commented in #58,
The problem is that FileStruct.key_ is referenced directly in 4 places. At least 2 of those places assume key_ to be the real key, instead of decorated key. These 2 places are in
ColumnFamilyStore.doFileAntiCompaction() (key_ is assigned to lastkey, which is used in isKeyInRanges)
ColumnFamilyStore.doFileCompaction()
In the above places, key_ has to be undeocrated first. Also, we need to make key_ private in FileStruct and use getKey() for referencing.
