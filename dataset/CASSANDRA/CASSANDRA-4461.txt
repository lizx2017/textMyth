Summary:
Schema no longer modifiable
Description:
It seems that after a while, our keyspaces can't be modified. They accept data, read and write works, truncate works, just keyspace and every column family inside it can't be dropped, created or altered.
This happens both on our 3 nodes test cluster and on our single-node dev cluster.
With 1.1.1, a rolling restart of the cluster seemed to solve the issue. This no longer happens with 1.1.2 .
