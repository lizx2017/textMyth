Summary:
ColumnFamilySplit length field is not serialized
Description:
The CqlRecordReader uses the InputSplit.getLength() method to populate it's totalRowCount field. It uses this when calculating the progress of a job.
The length field of ColumnFamilySplit is not serialized by the write and readFields methods so the totalRowCount in CqlRecordReader is always 0.
