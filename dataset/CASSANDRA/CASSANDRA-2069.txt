Summary:
Read repair causes tremendous GC pressure
Description:
To reproduce: start a three node cluster, insert 1M rows with stress.java and rf=2. Take one down, delete its data, then bring it back up and issue 1M reads against it. After the run is done you will see at least 1 STW long enough to mark the node as dead, often 4 or 5.
