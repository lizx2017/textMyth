Summary:
cqlsh does not wait for tracing to complete before printing
Description:
cqlsh currently sleeps 0.5 seconds before fetching trace info. Instead, it should fetch the system_traces.sessions row in a loop until the duration column is set (maybe with a total timeout of 30s). After the duration column is set, it's safe to fetch the rows from system_traces.events.
This is already fixed in 2.1 by the switch to the python driver, we just need to fix 2.0.
