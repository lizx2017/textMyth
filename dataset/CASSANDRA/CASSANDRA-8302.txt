Summary:
Filtering for CONTAINS (KEY) on frozen collection clustering columns within a partition does not work
Description:
Create a table like this:
CREATE TABLE foo (
    a int,
    b int,
    c frozen<set<int>>
    d int,
    PRIMARY KEY (a, b, c, d)
)
and add an index on it:
CREATE INDEX ON foo(b)
A query across all partitions will work correctly:
cqlsh:ks1> insert into foo (a, b, c, d) VALUES (0, 0, {1, 2}, 0);
cqlsh:ks1> SELECT * FROM foo WHERE b=0 AND c CONTAINS 2 and d=0 ALLOW FILTERING;

 a | b | c      | d
---+---+--------+---
 0 | 0 | {1, 2} | 0

(1 rows)
But if the query is restricted to a single partition, it is considered invalid (and the error message isn't great):
cqlsh:ks1> SELECT * FROM foo WHERE a=0 AND b=0 AND c CONTAINS 2 and d=0 ALLOW FILTERING;
code=2200 [Invalid query] message="No secondary indexes on the restricted columns support the provided operators: "
