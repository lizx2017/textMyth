Summary:
Move SegmentedFile, IndexSummary and BloomFilter to utilising RefCounted
Description:
There are still a few bugs with resource management, especially around SSTableReader cleanup, esp. when intermixing with compaction. This migration should help. We can simultaneously "simplify" the logic in SSTableReader to not track the replacement chain, only to take a new reference to each of the underlying resources.
