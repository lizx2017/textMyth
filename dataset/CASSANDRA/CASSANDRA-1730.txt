Summary:
Fat clients are never removed
Description:
After a failed bootstrap, these lines repeat infinitely:
INFO [Timer-0] 2010-11-11 01:58:32,708 Gossiper.java (line 406) FatClient /10.104.73.164 has been silent for 3600000ms, removing from gossip
INFO [GMFD:1] 2010-11-11 01:59:03,685 Gossiper.java (line 591) Node /10.104.73.164 is now part of the cluster
Changing the IP on the node but using the same token causes a conflict, requiring either a full cluster restart or changing the token. This is especially easy to run into in practice in a virtual environment such as ec2.
