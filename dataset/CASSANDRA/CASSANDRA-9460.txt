From a glance at the code in the stacktrace, it looks like there was a null cell in the ColumnFamily that we were creating a digest of. This error is probably particular to "short reads".
Here's the failing test: http://cassci.datastax.com/job/cassandra-2.1_dtest/lastCompletedBuild/testReport/consistency_test/TestConsistency/short_read_test/. I've attached the logs for the node with the error.
We saw this issue against 2.1, but the problem may also exist with 2.0 and/or 2.2.
