Summary:
Rejecting keyspace creation when RF > N is incorrect
Description:
The behavior introduced in this patch http://www.mail-archive.com/commits@cassandra.apache.org/msg05913.html is incorrect.
Disallowing keyspace creation when RF > N is semantically incorrect and makes both scaling a cluster up and down more difficult than it should be. This is compounded by the current lack of any API methods to change the replication factor. Most dynamo style systems allow RF to be set > N for smaller clusters. The cluster will behave as if RF = N until enough nodes are added such that RF < N.
