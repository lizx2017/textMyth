Summary:
TCP writes get stuck
Description:
In our test cluster, I observed that on some nodes, TCP writes get accumulated in TcpConnection.pendingWrites. However, the selector never gets a ready to write event. As a result, all writes get stuck. This is because write(message) and doPendingWrites() are not fully synchronized. This following situation can happen:
1. write(message) adds stuff to pendingWrites.
2. a ready to write event happens; in doPendingWrites() buffered requests are written to socket
3. another write request happens, in write(message), the test for pendingWrites.isEmpty() is false
4. doPendingWrites() finishes writing all buffered request to socket
5. in write(message), the new request is added to pendingWrites
Now, ready to write events will never happen again and all write requests get stuck in pendingWrites.
