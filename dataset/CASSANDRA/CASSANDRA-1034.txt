Summary:
Remove assumption that Key to Token is one-to-one
Description:
get_range_slices assumes that Tokens do not collide and converts a KeyRange to an AbstractBounds. For RandomPartitioner, this assumption isn't safe, and would lead to a very weird heisenberg.
Converting AbstractBounds to use a DecoratedKey would solve this, because the byte[] key portion of the DecoratedKey can act as a tiebreaker. Alternatively, we could make DecoratedKey extend Token, and then use DecoratedKeys in places where collisions are unacceptable.
