cqlsh> CREATE KEYSPACE demodb          WITH strategy_class = 'org.apache.cassandra.locator.SimpleStrategy'          AND strategy_options:replication_factor='1' ;
Bad Request: line 1:129 mismatched input ':' expecting '='
Perhaps you meant to use CQL 2? Try using the -2 option when starting cqlsh.

cqlsh> CREATE KEYSPACE Excelsior WITH strategy_class = 'SimpleStrategy'
   ...   AND strategy_options:replication_factor = 1;
Bad Request: line 2:22 mismatched input ':' expecting '='
It seems that in Cassandra 1.2 I am no longer able to create a keyspace.
