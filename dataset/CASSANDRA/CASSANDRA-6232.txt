Summary:
Installation shouldn't fail if /etc/sysctl.d/cassandra is deleted
Description:
The Debian package's postinst currently has this snippet code, under the "configure" action (i.e. what runs when installing or upgrading):
        if ! sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/cassandra.conf; then
            [...]
            rm -v /etc/sysctl.d/cassandra.conf
        fi
/etc/sysctl.d/cassandra.conf is a conffile and might be removed by the system administrator. The sysadmin might not want this sysctl setting or have an entirely different system of managing the /etc/sysctl.d hierarchy (in our case that would be puppet).
Since this piece of code doesn't check for the existence and doesn't use rm's "-f" argument, if the file doesn't exist the rm call fails and the package installation is aborted.
I'd propose checking for the file's existence instead of just "sysctl -p", so that you can avoid the nasty warnings too, but adding -f to rm shouldn't hurt either.
Note that this would probably fail on package upgrades under OpenVZ too, which according to the error message should be a supported configuration.
