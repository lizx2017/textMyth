Summary:
Clean up mbeans that return Internal Cassandra types
Description:
We need to clean up wherever we return internal cassandra objects over jmx. Namely CompactionInfo objects as well as Tokens. There may be a few other examples.
This is bad for two reasons
1. You have to load the cassandra jar when querying these mbeans, which sucks.
2. Stuff breaks between versions when things are moved. For example, CASSANDRA-1610 moves the compaction related classes around. Any code querying those jmx mbeans in 0.8.0 is now broken in 0.8.2. (assuming those moves stay in the 0.8 branch)
For things like CompactionInfo we should just expose more mbean methods or serialize to something standard like json.
I'd like to target this for 0.8.2. Since we've already broken compatibility between 0.8.0 and 0.8.1, I'd say just fix this everywhere now.
