Summary:
Support custom secondary indexes in CQL
Description:
Through thrift users can add custom secondary indexes to the column metadata.
The following syntax is used in PLSQL, and I think we could use something similar.
CREATE INDEX <NAME> ON <TABLE> (<COLUMN>) [INDEXTYPE IS (<TYPENAME>) [PARAMETERS (<PARAM>[, <PARAM>])]
