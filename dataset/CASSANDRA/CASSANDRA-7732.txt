Summary:
Counter replication mutation can have corrupt cell name values (via pooled Netty buffers)
Description:
Counter replication mutation can have corrupt cell name values (via pooled Netty buffers), because CM.apply()-created replication mutation doesn't copy the cell names/partition key from the original mutation AND eventually doesn't have the same source frame, making ref counting not work there.
