Summary:
assert when using CL.EACH_QUORUM
Description:
When using the NetworkTopology strategy, I am able to write using CL.LOCAL_QUORUM. When I attempt to write using CL.EACH_QUORUM, an assert is hit in DatacenterSyncWriteResponseHandler. Tracing the call through to the NetworkTopology code, it seems that this particular handler is only used when CL = EACH_QUORUM, yet the code asserts.
