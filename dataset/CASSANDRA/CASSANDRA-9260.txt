Summary:
Threadpool in RepairSession is not shutdown on failure
Description:
We are not closing taskExecutor in RepairSession if any RepairJob fails. The only way it will close is if a replica goes down and shutdown is called via IFailureDetectionEventListener.
If RepairJob fails due to say snapshot timing out, C* will not call shutdown on this pool.
