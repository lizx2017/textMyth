Summary:
handle old gossip properly
Description:
(1) If a node has been moving in the ring, further bootstraps by other nodes will cause errors as they are handling STATE_LEAVING gossip without having such member in token metadata.
(2) When a node bootstraps, it handles all ep states in the order they happen to arrive. If the first one to arrive has moved in the past (that is, it has STATE_LEAVING in its ep state), getNaturalEndpoint will throw ArrayIndexOutOfBounds exception as sortedTokens.size() == 0.
