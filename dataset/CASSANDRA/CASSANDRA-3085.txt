Summary:
Race condition in sstable reference counting
Description:
DataTracker gives us an atomic View of memtable/sstables, but acquiring references is not atomic. So it is possible to acquire references to an SSTableReader object that is no longer valid, as in this example:
View V contains sstables
{A, B}
. We attempt a read in thread T using this View.
Meanwhile, A and B are compacted to
{C}
, yielding View W. No references exist to A or B so they are cleaned up.
Back in thread T we acquire references to A and B. This does not cause an error, but it will when we attempt to read from them next.
