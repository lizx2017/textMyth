Summary:
StorageProxy.isAnyHostDown should check host that are part of the member (instead of just all unreachable)
Description:
summary pretty much says it all... also fixed the javadoc as it has the return result reversed.
(luckily the only place calling this right now is truncate and it is doing it right, just the doc was incorrect)
