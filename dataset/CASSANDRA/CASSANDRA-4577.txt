Summary:
Allow preparing queries without parameters
Description:
Currently it's not possible to prepare any queries that do not take any parameters using Cassandra's new native protocol because of an assertion error.
This makes client development rather difficult (you need to parse CQL queries to detect the number of parameters and skip the preparation of those) and there is probably no reason to handle queries with no parameters separately.
