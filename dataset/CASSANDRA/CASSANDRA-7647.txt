Summary:
Track min/max timestamps of range tombstones
Description:
When compacting etc. we don't track min/max timestamps of range tombstones, meaning a compacted sstable with only RTs will get bad values.
End result can be that we drop the sstable since it might look like it only contains tombstones and is older than all other sstables, and we lose the valid RT.
