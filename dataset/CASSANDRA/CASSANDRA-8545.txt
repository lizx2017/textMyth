Summary:
Simple hints are timing out on replay
Description:
The dtest consistency_test.py:TestConsistency.hintedhandoff_test has been failing consistently on cassci on 2.0-HEAD since 8285 was committed. 100 hints are attempted to be replayed, but only ~90 succeed before it aborts.
We see:
 INFO [HintedHandoff:1] 2014-12-28 18:37:46,259 HintedHandOffManager.java (line 469) Timed out replaying hints to /127.0.0.2; aborting (87 delivered)
in the log.
I have only been able to reproduce this once locally. This test has failed intermittently for a very long time, but has not passed on our jenkins slaves since the commit of 8285.
