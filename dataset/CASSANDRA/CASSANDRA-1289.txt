Summary:
GossipTimerTask stops running if an Exception occurs
Description:
The GossipTimerTask run() method has a try/catch around its body, but it re-throws all Exceptions as RuntimeExceptions. This causes the GossipTimerTask to no longer run (due to the way the underlying Java Timer implementation works), stopping the periodic gossip status checks.
Combine this problem with a bug like CASSANDRA-757 (not yet fixed in 0.6.x) and you get into a state where the server keeps running, but gossip is no longer occurring, preventing node addition / removal from happening.
I see two potential choices:
1) Log the error but don't re-throw it so that the GossipTimerTask will continue to run on its next interval.
2) Shutdown the server, since continuing to run without gossip subtly breaks other functionality / knowledge of other nodes.
