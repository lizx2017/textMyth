Summary:
findSuitableEndPoint not returning closest endPoint
Description:
After we switched everything over to Rackaware, I was noticing queries still taking 80ms+. We run in multiple datacenter's and I had a suspicion that it was just connecting to a node on east coast. It looks like findSuitableEndPoint sorts endpoints, but does not use the returned sorted endpoints when needing to return the final endpoint.
