Summary:
Commit Log Allocator deadlock after first start with empty commitlog directory
Description:
While testing CASSANDRA-3541 at some point stress completely timed out. I proceeded to shut the cluster down and 2/3 JVMs hang infinitely. After a while, one of them logged:
WARN 19:07:50,133 Some hints were not written before shutdown.  This is not supposed to happen.  You should (a) run repair, and (b) file a bug report
