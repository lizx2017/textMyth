Summary:
get_count with 'count' param between 1024 and ~actual column count fails
Description:
If you run get_count() with the 'count' param of the SliceRange set to a number between 1024 and (approximately) the actual number of columns in the row, something seems to silently fail internally, resulting in a client side timeout. Using a 'count' param outside of this range (lower or much higher) works just fine.
This seems to affect all of 1.1 and 1.2.0-beta1, but not 1.0.
