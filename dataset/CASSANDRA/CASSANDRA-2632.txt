Summary:
ConfigurationException when starting a node after deleting LocationInfo SStables
Description:
from http://www.mail-archive.com/user@cassandra.apache.org/msg13170.html
SystemTable.checkHealth() assumes that if the LOCATION_KEY row is not in the STATUS system CF their should be no other files in the system data directory. If it's safe to delete the LocationInfo sstables this stops the server restarting.
I think the intention of the check is to assert that the reason the row was not found is that there is no data in the STATUS CF.
