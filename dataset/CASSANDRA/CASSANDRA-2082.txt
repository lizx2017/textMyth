Summary:
Saved row cache continues to be read past max cache size
Description:
Scenario:
Node has a saved row cache of size n
node OOMs
Make row cache size = .5n to prevent OOM while we debug, restart node.
n items are still read from the row cache, making startup take twice as long as needed.
(This is intended as a straightforward bug, not as a hackish CASSANDRA-1966.)
