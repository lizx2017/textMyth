Summary:
Don't require quotes for true and false
Description:
The docs at http://cassandra.apache.org/doc/cql3/CQL.html#identifiers describe using double quotes for an identifier that is a reserved word. The following works as expected,
cqlsh:test> select "columnfamily" from system.schema_columnfamilies;
I have a table with a boolean column. In order to insert a boolean value, I have to enclose it in single quotes. The table looks like,
CREATE TABLE bool_test (
id int PRIMARY KEY,
val boolean
);
Here is what happens when I try using double quotes,
cqlsh:rhq> insert into bool_test (id, val) values (4, "false");
Bad Request: line 1:43 no viable alternative at input 'false'
The use of single quotes here seems inconsistent with what is described in the docs, and makes things a bit confusing. It would be nice if single or double quotes could be used for identifiers that are reserved words. I also think it is a bit counter-intuitive to require quotes for true and false which are literal values.
