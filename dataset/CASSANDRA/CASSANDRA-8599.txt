Summary:
Refactor or fix CqlStorage
Description:
In CASSANDRA-8541, for 2.1, I ultimately replace the non-existent CPIF references with CIF, since CNS was broken otherwise. But this means CS no longer works since it's not a simple drop in replacement (but have CNS work is better than having them both broken by a class that doesn't exist.) We can't just deprecate and remove CS either, because CNS extends it. We either need to fix CS to work with CIF, or we need to refactor CNS so that we can just remove CS.
