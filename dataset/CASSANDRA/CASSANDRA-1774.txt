Summary:
ColumnFamilyOutputFormat only writes one column (per key)
Description:
From mailing list http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.db.cassandra.user/10385
ColumnFamilyOutputFormat will only write out one column
per key.
Alex Burkoff also reported this nearly two months ago, but nobody ever
replied...
http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.db.cassandra.user/9325
has anyone any ideas?
should it be possible to write multiple columns out?
This is very easy to reproduce. Use the contrib/wordcount example, with
OUTPUT_REDUCER=cassandra and in WordCount.java add at line 132
> results.add(getMutation(key, sum));
> + results.add(getMutation(new Text("doubled"), sum*2));
Only the last mutation for any key seems to be written.
