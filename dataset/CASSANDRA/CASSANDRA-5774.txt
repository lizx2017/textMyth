Summary:
Fix system.schema_triggers-related trigger/schema issues
Description:
Among other things, the patch does the following:
adds missing schema_triggers to MigrationManager.resetLocalSchema()
adds missing schema_triggers to SystemKeyspace.serializeSchema() - so that triggers would be part of schema version calculation
adds missing schema_triggers to DefsTables.flushSchemaCFs()
adds missing triggers to CFMetaData.toSchema(), so that CFs created via thrift with triggers from the beginning would serialize triggers
removes triggers from CFMetaData.newIndexMetadata(), so that 2i CFs wouldn't inherit the triggers from the parent CF
There are other minor and not so minor changes, but these were the most critical ones. The patch also (unnecessarily) cleans up ColumnDefinition, but that was done to make it consistent with the new TriggerDefinition class.
The bulk of the patch is the updated thrift-gen files.
