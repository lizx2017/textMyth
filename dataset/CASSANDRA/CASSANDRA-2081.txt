Summary:
Consistency QUORUM does not work anymore (hector:Could not fullfill request on this host)
Description:
I'm using apache-cassandra-2011-01-28_20-06-01.jar and hector 7.0.25.
Using consistency level Quorum won't work anymore (tested it on read). Consisteny level ONE still works though
I have tried this with one dead node in my cluster.
If I restart cassandra with an older svn revision (apache-cassandra-2011-01-28_20-06-01.jar), I can access the cluster with consistency level QUORUM again, while still using apache-cassandra-2011-01-28_20-06-01.jar and hector 7.0.25 in my application.

intr1n11 is marked as up however and I can also access the node through the cassandra cli.
