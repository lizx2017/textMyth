cassandra-topology.properties cannot reside inside jar file
Description:
PropertyFileSnitch cannot load the cassandra-topology.properties if it is located inside a jar file.
At startup cassandra will print and exit
[ERROR] 20:50:01 Fatal error: Unable to read cassandra-topology.properties
Bad configuration; unable to start server
It seems FBUtilities.resourceToFIle(..) can only be used for loading plain files.
The attached patch solves the problem. It uses the standard java approach for loading a resource stream...
