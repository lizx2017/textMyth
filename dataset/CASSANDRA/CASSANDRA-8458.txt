Summary:
Don't give out positions in an sstable beyond its first/last tokens
Description:
Looks like we include tmplink sstables in streams in 2.1+, and when we do, sometimes we get this error message on the receiving side: java.io.IOException: Corrupt input data, block did not start with 2 byte signature ('ZV') followed by type byte, 2-byte length). I've only seen this happen when a tmplink sstable is included in the stream.
We can not just exclude the tmplink files when starting the stream - we need to include the original file, which we might miss since we check if the requested stream range intersects the sstable range.
