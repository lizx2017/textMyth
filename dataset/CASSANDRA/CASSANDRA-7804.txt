Confusing error message when condition is set on primary key column
Description:
If you set a CAS condition on a primary key column, you'll get an error that's somewhat confusing:
cqlsh:ks1> CREATE TABLE mytable (a int PRIMARY KEY, b int);
cqlsh:ks1> UPDATE mytable SET b = 0 WHERE a = 0 IF a = 0;
code=2200 [Invalid query] message="PRIMARY KEY part a found in SET part"
