Summary:
single_file_split_test fails on 2.1
Description:
In CASSANDRA-8623, we fix an issue about getting "Data component is missing" errors when splitting multiple sstable one at the time. I wrote a dtest for that, which work properly to test that error. However, it seems that the CompactionExecutor is failing. It's not the same error, but looks related.
