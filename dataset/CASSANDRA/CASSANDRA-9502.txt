Summary:
Range-slice queries with CL>ONE do unnecessary read-repairs
Description:
Scenario:
keyspace with RF>1
table filled with data (no tombstones)
CL QUORUM (anything > ONE)
select * from table (range-slice)
trace output looks fine
create some tombstones (e.g. delete from table where key = foo)
select * from table (range-slice)
trace output shows mutations (RR)
That RR is triggered from RangeSliceResponseResolver.Reducer.getReduced.
Seems like a live-cell-count comparison is missing.
Will create a dtest to prove the behavior and probably a patch.
NB: RowDataResolver and RowDigestResolver are fine.
