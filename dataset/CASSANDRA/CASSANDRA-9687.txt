Summary:
Wrong partitioner after upgrading sstables (secondary indexes are not handled correctly after CASSANDRA-6962)
Description:
After upgrading one of 15 nodes from 2.1.7 to 2.2.0.rc1, C* upgrades automatic sstables. After restart of C*, some of these new generated sstables are not accepted anymore and C* crashes. If I delete the affected sstables, C* starts again.

ERROR [SSTableBatchOpen:1] 2015-06-30 13:08:54,861 SSTableReader.java:432 - Cannot open D:\Programme\Cassandra\data\data\nieste\niesteinverters\la-540-big; partitioner org.apache.cassandra.dht.LocalPartitioner does not match system partitioner org.apache.cassandra.dht.Murmur3Partitioner.  Note that the default partitioner starting with Cassandra 1.2 is Murmur3Partitioner, so you will need to edit that to match your old partitioner if upgrading.
