Summary:
Fix Hinted Handoff replay
Description:
Broken in CASSANDRA-2668. Brandon explains:
the Ack and Ack2 verb handlers are applying a new ep state every time there is a generation change via Gossiper.applyStateLocally, so it's always unset initially when the node starts up. state.hasToken() is set in the Gossiper's status check, which won't have happened when the onAlive event is sent to SS.
