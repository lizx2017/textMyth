Summary:
Creating a SuperColumnFamily other than BytesType results in incorrect comparator types
Description:
CF 1
ColumnFamily: CFCli (Super)
Columns sorted by: org.apache.cassandra.db.marshal.LongType/org.apache.cassandra.db.marshal.UTF8Type
Subcolumns sorted by: org.apache.cassandra.db.marshal.LongType
was created with cli using
create column family CFCli with column_type= 'Super' and comparator= 'LongType' and subcomparator='UTF8Type'
CF 2
ColumnFamily: CFYaml (Super)
Columns sorted by: org.apache.cassandra.db.marshal.LongType/org.apache.cassandra.db.marshal.UTF8Type
Subcolumns sorted by: org.apache.cassandra.db.marshal.LongType
was created with yaml using
column_families:
name: CFYaml
column_type: Super
compare_with: LongType
compare_subcolumns_with: UTF8Type
In both cases Subcolumn comparator was defined as UTF8Type but CF was created with subcomparatortype of LongType
