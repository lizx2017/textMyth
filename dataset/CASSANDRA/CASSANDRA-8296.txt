Summary:
Can't add new node to a Cluster due to invalid gossip generation
Description:
Hi all! I'm unable to add new node to an existing Cassandra cluster. I'm using GossipingPropertyFileSnitch and after starting cassandra I get following errors on other nodes:
WARN  [GossipStage:2] 2014-11-12 09:38:43,297 Gossiper.java:993 - received an invalid gossip generation for peer /10.210.3.230; local generation = 3, received generation = 1415785003
New node's IP is 10.210.3.230. I can't see this IP in
nodetool status
Any ideas?
