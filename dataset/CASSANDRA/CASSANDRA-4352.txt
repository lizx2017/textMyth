Summary:
cqlsh: ASSUME functionality broken by CASSANDRA-4198 fix
Description:
All uses of the ASSUME command in cqlsh now appear to be wholly ineffective at affecting subsequent value output.
This is due to a change in the grammar definition introduced by the fix for CASSANDRA-4198, upon which definition the ASSUME functionality relied.
All that's needed to fix is to update the token-binding names used.
