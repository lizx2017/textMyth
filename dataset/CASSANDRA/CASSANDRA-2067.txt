Summary:
refactor o.a.c.utils.UUIDGen to allow creating type 1 UUIDs for a given time
Description:
CASSANDRA-2027 creates the need to generate type 1 UUIDs using arbitrary date/times. IMO, this would be a good opportunity to replace o.a.c.utils.UUIDGen with the class that Gary Dusbabek wrote for Flewton (https://github.com/flewton/flewton/blob/master/src/com/rackspace/flewton/util/UUIDGen.java), which is better/more comprehensive. We can even eliminate the dependency on JUG.
Patches to follow.
