Summary:
Update token metadata for NORMAL state
Description:
The handleStateNormal() method in StorageService.java doesn't update the tokenmetadata. This means if you try to decommission a node but for some reason it fails, and then you bring the node back up, all other nodes will see it in a 'Leaving' state. When the state jumps back to normal they should update the token metadata to reflect that.
This also means you won't be able to call 'removetoken' on that node, unless you restart another node in the cluster in order to put it back in a 'normal' state.
