Summary:
Memtable Flush writers doesn't actually flush in parallel
Description:
The flushWriter JMXEnabledThreadPoolExecutor sets the core pool min to 1, and sets the LBQ to DatabaseDescriptor.getFlushWriters(). Increasing memtable_flush_writers should allow us to flush more in parallel. The pool will not grow until LBQ fills up to DatabaseDescriptor.getFlushWriters().
