Summary:
The binary transport doesn't load truststore file
Description:
org.apache.cassandra.transport.Server.SecurePipelineFactory
this.sslContext = SSLFactory.createSSLContext(encryptionOptions, false);
false there means that truststore file won't be loaded in any case.
And that means that the file will not be used to validate clients when require_client_auth==true, making http://www.datastax.com/documentation/cassandra/2.0/cassandra/security/secureNewTrustedUsers_t.html meaningless.
The only way to workaround that currently is to start C* with -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=conf/.truststore
I believe we should load truststore when require_client_auth==true,
