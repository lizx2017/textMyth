Summary:
Make cqlsh look for a suitable python version
Description:
On RHEL 5, which I guess we still want to support, the default "python" in the path is still 2.4. cqlsh does use a fair number of python features introduced in 2.5, like collections.defaultdict, functools.partial, generators. We can require RHEL 5 users to install a later python from EPEL, but we'd have to call it as 'python2.5', or 'python2.6', etc.
So rather than take the time to vet everything against python2.4, we may want to make a wrapper script for cqlsh that checks for the existence of python2.7, 2.6, and 2.5, and calls the appropriate one to run the real cqlsh.
