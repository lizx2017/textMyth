Summary:
Compaction of system keyspaces during startup can cause early loading of non-system keyspaces
Description:
This then can result in an inconsistent CFS state, as cleanup of e.g. compaction leftovers does not get reflected in DataTracker. It happens because StorageService.getLoad() iterates over and opens all CFS, and this is called by Compaction.
