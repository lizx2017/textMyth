Summary:
Deal with backward compatibilty issue of broken AbstractBounds serialization
Description:
This ticket is related to CASSANDRA-9856 and CASSANDRA-9775. Even if the broken/incomplete serialization of AbstractBounds is not a problem per-se for pre-3.0 versions, it's still a problem for trunk and even though it's fixed by CASSANDRA-9775 for 3.0 nodes, it might be a problem for 3.0 nodes talking to older nodes.
As the paging tests where those that exposed the problem (on trunk) in the first place, it would be nice to modify said paging tests to work on mixed version clustering so we can valid if it is a problem. If it is, then we'll probably have to add redundant checks on trunk so they ignore anything the 3.0 node sends incorrectly.
