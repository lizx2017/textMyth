Summary:
"Select" query with "IN" restriction times out in CQLSH
Description:
I've noticed that pylib.cqlshlib.test.test_cqlsh_output.TestCqlshOutput#test_numeric_output tests fails on the current 2.1 branch, which wasn't the case before.
Here are the steps to reproduce. I'm attaching the script to populate schema.
mstepura-mac:cassandra mikhail$ bin/cqlsh -f <path_to>/init_bug.cql
mstepura-mac:cassandra mikhail$ bin/cqlsh
Connected to Test Cluster at 127.0.0.1:9042.
[cqlsh 5.0.0 | Cassandra 2.1.0-beta2-SNAPSHOT | CQL spec 3.1.6 | Native protocol v2]
Use HELP for help.
cqlsh> use test;
cqlsh:test> select intcol, bigintcol, varintcol from has_all_types where num in (0, 1, 2, 3, 4);
errors={}, last_host=127.0.0.1
cqlsh:test>
That works perfectly on 2.0 branch. And there are no errors in the logs.
