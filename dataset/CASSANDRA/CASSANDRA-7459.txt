Summary:
CqlRecordWriter doesn't close socket connections
Description:
Using spark with `CqlOutputFormat` results in thousands of open connections to cassandra (and then crashes unless they get garbage collected fast enough). This is because each save to cassandra task creates a `CqlRecordWriter` which opens a bunch of connections but calling close on those writers does not actually close their socket connections to cassandra.
