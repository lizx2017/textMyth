Summary:
replace_address cannot find node to be replaced node after seed node restart
Description:
If a node failed and a cluster was restarted (which is common case on massive outages), replace_address fails with
Caused by: java.lang.RuntimeException: Cannot replace_address /172.19.56.97 because it doesn't exist in gossip
jvm 1    |  at org.apache.cassandra.service.StorageService.prepareReplacementInfo(StorageService.java:472)
jvm 1    |  at org.apache.cassandra.service.StorageService.joinTokenRing(StorageService.java:724)

Although neccessary information is saved in system tables on seed nodes, it is not loaded to gossip on seed node, so a replacement node cannot get this info.
Attached patch loads all information from system tables to gossip with generation 0 and fixes some bugs around this info on shadow gossip round.
