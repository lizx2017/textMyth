Summary:
alter table add in CQL3 allows adding columns to COMPACT STORAGE tables
Description:
From the docs:
These additions to a table are not allowed:
Adding a column having the same name as an existing column.
Adding columns to tables defined with COMPACT STORAGE.
however, this still works against a domain defined with COMPACT STORAGE in cqlsh
it appears that the metadata, however, is not defined correctly.
