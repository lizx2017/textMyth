Summary:
Deleting and re-inserting row causes error in get_slice count parameter
Description:
I've found that when I delete an entire row in a column family with super columns, and then re-insert values with the same row and super column keys, the count parameter to the get_slice call no longer works properly. Its like it is still counting the deleted columns, but only returning the new columns.
The following example uses the Ruby Cassandra client (see link below), but I've seen the same behavior with the Java Thrift interface.
Test code:
--------------
require 'rubygems'
require 'cassandra'
cc = Cassandra.new('Keyspace1')
cc.insert(:Super1,'test-key1',{'bucket1' => {'1' => 'Item 1', '2' => 'Item 2', '5' => 'Item 5'}})
items = cc.get(:Super1,'test-key1','bucket1')
puts "returned #
{items.size} items, should be 3"
cc.remove(:Super1,'test-key1')
items = cc.get(:Super1,'test-key1','bucket1')
puts "returned #{items.size}
items, should be 0"
cc.insert(:Super1,'test-key1',{'bucket1' => {'3' => 'Item 3', '4' => 'Item 4', '6' => 'Item 6'}})
items = cc.get(:Super1,'test-key1','bucket1')
puts "returned #
{items.size} items, should be 3"
items = cc.get(:Super1,'test-key1','bucket1',:count => 3)
puts "returned #{items.size}
items, should be 3"
items = cc.get(:Super1,'test-key1','bucket1',:count => 4)
puts "returned #
{items.size} items, should be 3"
items = cc.get(:Super1,'test-key1','bucket1',:count => 5)
puts "returned #{items.size}
items, should be 3"
items = cc.get(:Super1,'test-key1','bucket1',:count => 6)
puts "returned #
{items.size}
items, should be 3"
Output:
returned 3 items, should be 3
returned 0 items, should be 0
returned 3 items, should be 3
returned 1 items, should be 3
returned 2 items, should be 3
returned 2 items, should be 3
returned 3 items, should be 3
