Summary:
remove RangeKeySample from attributes in jmx
Description:
RangeKeySample in org.apache.cassandra.db:type=StorageService MBean can be really huge (over 200MB in our case). That's a problem for monitoring tools as they're not build for that. Recommended and often used mx4j may be killer in this situation.
It would be good enough to make RangeKeySample "operation" instead of "attribute" in jmx. Looking at how MBeanServer.registerMBean() works we can do one of the following:
a) add some dummy parameter to getRangeKeySample
b) name it differently - not like getter (next time somebody will rename it back)
c) implement MXBean instead of MBean (a lot of work)
Any of those work. All of them are "hacks". Any better idea?
BTW: It's blocker for some installations. Our update to 1.1.2 caused downtime, downgrade back to 1.0.x, repairs, etc.
