Summary:
word_count/pig loadfunc don't match the ColumnFamilyInputFormat ByteBuffer signature
Description:
In recent commits, ColumnFamilyInputFormat's signature has changed to use ByteBuffers. This signature needs to match the word_count example and the pig load func. There are a few options:
1) The ColumnFamilyInputFormat signature itself didn't need to change - it could translate from byte[] to ByteBuffer internally.
2) Change the word_count and pig load func to use ByteBuffer
3) Just use the AvroColumnFamilyInputFormat.
I think option 1 would be best for now since that's less of a change.
