Summary:
Connection leak in CQLRecordWriter
Description:
Ran into connection leaks when using CQLCassandra apache-cassandra-2.2.0-beta1-src + CQLOutputFormat (via CqlNativeStorage).
It seems like the order blocks of code starting at https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/trunk/src/java/org/apache/cassandra/hadoop/cql3/CqlRecordWriter.java#L298 were reversed in 2.2 which leads to the connection leaks.
