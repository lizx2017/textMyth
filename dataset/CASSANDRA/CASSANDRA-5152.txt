Summary:
CQLSH prompt doesn't properly accept input characters on OSX
Description:
In the terminal for OSX Mountain Lion, I execute 'cqlsh'. When I try to type the 't' letter, nothing appears on the screen. All other keys work, and no other shell application is affected in this manner. This is not an issue for Cassandra 1.1.6 - just started happening when I downloaded Cassandra 1.2.0
