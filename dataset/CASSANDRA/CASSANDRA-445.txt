Summary:
commitlog may consider writes flushed, that are not yet
Description:
Jun Rao explains:
Suppose there are 3 updates u1, u2, and u3. They are written to commit log in that order. If u1 and u3 are applied to memtable first and at that point, a flush is triggered. After the flush completes, it will move the commit log restarting position based on the log for u3. However, u2 hasn't been persisted on disk yet. This means that if the node dies now, the recovery logic won't replay u2 from the log.
