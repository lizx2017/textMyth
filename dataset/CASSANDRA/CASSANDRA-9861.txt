Summary:
When forcibly exiting due to OOM, we should produce a heap dump
Description:
CASSANDRA-7507 introduced earlier termination on encountering an OOM, due to lack of certainty about system state. However a side effect is that we never produce heap dumps on OOM. We should ideally try to produce one forcibly before exiting.
