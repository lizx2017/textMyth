Summary:
clientutil depends on FBUtilities (bad)
Description:
clientutils' (indirect )dependency on FBUtilities (needed for tests) would result in huge numbers of classes being pulled in transitively.
The attached patch moves the bytesToHex and hexToBytes methods into a new class (o.a.c.utils.Hex), which has no external dependencies.
This should be pretty safe, but I've marked it fixfor-1.0.1 since we're so close to release, and because the JDBC driver can embed a snapshot jar in the meantime.
