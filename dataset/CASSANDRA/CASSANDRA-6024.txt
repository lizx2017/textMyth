Summary:
sstableloader uploads full range sstable into some single range node(s) only
Description:
sstableloader from 1.2.9 uploads full-size sstables (not divided by token ranges) generated with SSTableSimpleUnsortedWriter (no compression options) into Cassandra 1.2.9 nodes of some single token range (on different clusters may be different range, but the same on the same cluster).
sstableloader from Cassandra 1.2.6 uploads to Cassandra 1.2.9 nodes as expected, sstables sent divided by token ranges.
VNodes are not used, partitioner is RandomPartitioner.
In both cases with 1.2.6 and 1.2.9 all sstables files generated the same, no binary difference.
All target nodes returns correct token ranges.
example 1:
3 nodes, 1 DC, RF=2, 2 out of 3 nodes receives 100% of sstable data instead of 66.6%, rest node receives nothing.
example 2:
32 nodes, 4 DCs, 8 nodes per DC, each DC RF=1 (total RF=4), same range node in each DC receives 100% of sstable instead of 1/8 (cleanup will remove 7/8 of received data), other nodes receives nothing.
