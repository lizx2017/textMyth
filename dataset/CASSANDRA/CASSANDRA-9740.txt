Summary:
Can't transition from write survey to normal mode
Description:
When attempting a transition a node from write survey to normal mode, the "nodetool join" invocation fails as the node is already "joined" (even though it's only bootstrapped).
Attached is a trivial patch to fix. Note: I'm more concerned with ensuring correctness here rather than resolving an obscure bug.
