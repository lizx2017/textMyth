Summary:
cross-partition ordering should have warning or be disallowed when paging
Description:
consider this schema/data/query:
CREATE TABLE paging_test (
    id int,
    value text,
    PRIMARY KEY (id, value)
) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (value ASC)

            |id|value|
            |1 |a    |
            |2 |b    |
            |1 |c    |
            |2 |d    | 
            |1 |e    | 
            |2 |f    | 
            |1 |g    | 
            |2 |h    |
            |1 |i    |
            |2 |j    |

select * from paging_test where id in (1,2) order by value asc;
When paging the above query I get the sorted results from id=1 first, then the sorted results from id=2 after that. I was testing this because I was curious if the paging system could somehow globally sort the results but it makes sense that we can't do that, since that would require all results to be collated up front.
