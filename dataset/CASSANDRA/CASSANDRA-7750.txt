Summary:
Do not flush on truncate if "durable_writes" is false.
Description:
CASSANDRA-7511 changed truncate so it will always flush to fix commit log issues. If durable_writes is false, then there will not be able data in the commit log for the table, so we can safely just drop the memtables and not flush.
