Summary:
repair streaming forwarding loop
Description:
I am able to reproduce what appears to be a streaming forwarding loop when running repairs. This affect only nodes using broadcast_address (ec2 external ip) & listen_address of 0.0.0.0. (Configuration is using property file snitch in a multi DC NTS where some DC's are EC2 and others are not). The hosts in the other dc's not using broadcast_address do not experience this symptom.
on ec2 host dc1host1:
INFO [AntiEntropyStage:1] 2011-09-13 06:34:01,673 StreamingRepairTask.java (line 211) streaming task #ce793c30-ddd1-11e0-0000-071a4b76fefb Received task from /0.0.0.0 to stream 12259 ranges to /external.ec2.ip.dc1host3
INFO [AntiEntropyStage:1] 2011-09-13 06:34:01,673 StreamingRepairTask.java (line 136) streaming task #ce793c30-ddd1-11e0-0000-071a4b76fefb Forwarding streaming repair of 12259 ranges to /external.ec2.ip.of.dc1host1 (to be streamed with /external.ip.of.host3)
The above appears to trigger another streaming task and results in saturating the network interfaces dc1host1. The above log entries are repeated until cassandra is killed.
