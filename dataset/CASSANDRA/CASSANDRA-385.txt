Summary:
intellibootstrap
Description:
ideally bootstrap mode should determine its new position on the ring by examining the Load of the existing nodes in the cluster. (currently Load is just disk space used but making this pluggable is another ticket.) having found the highest-load-node-that-is-not-participating-in-bootstrap, it should ask that node for a Token which would move half the keys over to the new node.
This is easily computed since we have a periodic sampling of keys in memory of all the keys on disk, and even SSTable.getIndexedKeys that merges all such keys. So pick the midpoint, and turn it into a token (these are decorated keys so that is always possible).
