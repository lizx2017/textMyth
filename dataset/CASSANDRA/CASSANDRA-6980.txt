Summary:
Non-droppable verbs shouldn't be dropped from OTC
Description:
In CASSANDRA-5393, a retry was added if there was an exception sending a non-droppable verb. However, the message can still be dropped if it has been in the queue longer than rpc timeout. When this happens for e.g. Merkle trees, the repair hangs. The message should not be dropped.
