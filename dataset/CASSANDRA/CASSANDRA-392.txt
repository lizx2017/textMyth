Summary:
Deadlock with SelectorManager.doProcess and TcpConnection.write
Description:
We ran into a deadlock last night:
Name: MESSAGE-SERIALIZER-POOL:2
State: BLOCKED on sun.nio.ch.SelectionKeyImpl@2e257f1b owned by: TCP Selector Manager
Total blocked: 1 Total waited: 1
Stack trace:
org.apache.cassandra.net.SelectionKeyHandler.turnOnInterestOps(SelectionKeyHandler.java:73)
org.apache.cassandra.net.TcpConnection.write(TcpConnection.java:186)
locked org.apache.cassandra.net.TcpConnection@5ab9f791

Name: TCP Selector Manager
State: BLOCKED on org.apache.cassandra.net.TcpConnection@5ab9f791 owned by: MESSAGE-SERIALIZER-POOL:2
Total blocked: 2 Total waited: 0
Stack trace:
org.apache.cassandra.net.TcpConnection.connect(TcpConnection.java:360)
org.apache.cassandra.net.SelectorManager.doProcess(SelectorManager.java:131)
locked sun.nio.ch.SelectionKeyImpl@2e257f1b
org.apache.cassandra.net.SelectorManager.run(SelectorManager.java:98)
The SelectionManager.doProcess acquires a monitor on the SelectionKey and then calls methods such as TcpConnection.connect(SelectionKey key) which obtains a monitor for the TcpConnection object itself. Another task eg: MessageSerializationTask can come along and call write(Message message) which obtains a monitor for the TCPConnection first and then on calls to turnOnInterestOps tries to obtain the monitor for the SelectionKey which causes the deadlock.
