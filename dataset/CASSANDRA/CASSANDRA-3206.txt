Summary:
increase file descriptor limit in deb, rpm packages
Description:
We can use a lot of file descriptors (one per socket, 5? per sstable). People hit this regularly on the user list and it will get worse with Leveled compaction, which limits sstable size to a relatively low size (currently 5MB).
