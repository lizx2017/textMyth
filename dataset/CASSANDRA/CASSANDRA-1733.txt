Summary:
get_range_slices doesn't return key from start_key in KeyRange any more
Description:
The following is a test case which used to work for me before, but after upgrading to trunk it fails:
-Insert 50 or so keys to StandardByUUID1 CF in Keyspace1
-Try using get_range_slices with a KeyRange that has one of those keys you inserted earlier as its start_key with a count of 20
You will get 20 rows, but you won't get the row with specified start_key
Expected Result: you should get 20 rows back with the specified start_key as one of the rows
I am suing Random Partitioner with RF2 and CL1. I understand that Random Partitioner will not give you keys in order, but the behavior before at least returned a random subset including the row with specified start_key.
Please investigate.
