Summary:
Java heap flags are being set to invalid values on Windows
Description:
In conf/cassandra-env.ps1 max heap size is set based on system memory. New generation heap size is then set based on max heap size. Integer division is not used, and thus floating point results are possible, which will prevent cassandra from being started up. The following error is seen:
Invalid initial eden size: -Xmn511.75M
Error: Could not create the Java Virtual Machine.
Error: A fatal exception has occurred. Program will exit.
