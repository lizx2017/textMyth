Summary:
Parallelize unit test runner
Description:
Currently we spend ~15 minutes running unit tests.
We can parallelize the unit tests by splitting the classes up across processes and using more cores.
This patch adds a new variable -Dtest.runners=X (default is 1)
Running with 4 runtime goes from 15min to 6min.
Beyond 1 runner per core I don't see much of a difference
