Summary:
Less than operator when comparing timeuuids behaves as less than equal.
Description:
If we define the following column family using CQL3:
CREATE TABLE useractivity (
user_id int,
activity_id 'TimeUUIDType',
data text,
PRIMARY KEY (user_id, activity_id)
);
Add some values to it.
And then query it like:
SELECT * FROM useractivity WHERE user_id = '3' AND activity_id < '2012-11-07 18:18:22-0800' ORDER BY activity_id DESC LIMIT 1;
the record with timeuuid '2012-11-07 18:18:22-0800' returns in the results.
According to the documentation, on CQL3 the '<' and '>' operators are strict, meaning not inclusive, so this seems to be a bug.
