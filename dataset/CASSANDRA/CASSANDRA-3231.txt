Summary:
CQL does not throw an error when invalid hex is supplied
Description:
As reported on irc, if you try to create an index on a CF with a default comparator of BytesType, but you supply invalid hex, weird things happen. Namely if you try to create one on 'category' you instead get one on '\xca\xfe\xff\xff', which is 4 bytes that appears to coincide with attempting to interpret 'ca', 'te', 'go', 'ry' as hex.
