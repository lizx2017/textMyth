Summary:
debian initscript sometimes mistakenly thinks it failed, gives extraneous output
Description:
On my test systems, which are all relatively slow VMs, the Cassandra debian initscript usually thinks it fails to start, even though the startup was successful. It appears that jsvc forks the daemon process and exits, and the initscript check for the running Cassandra service occurs before the new daemon is able to initialize itself and create its pidfile.
On top of that, most invocations end up spitting out a small amount of garbage from /bin/ps, in addition to the typical "Stopping Cassandra: cassandra." log messages one sees if verbose=yes in /etc/default/rcS. This is not very flattering.
Finally, the initscript should provide the "status" command to meet current LSB spec. The functionality is mostly complete already anyway, and it can be quite useful.
