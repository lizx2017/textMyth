Summary:
possible NPE in StorageProxy?
Description:
insert() in StorageProxy contains a logging statement that refers to a possibly un-initialized variable
{{{
logger.debug("insert writing key " + rm.key() + " to " + unhintedMessage.getMessageId() + "@" + hintedTarget + " for " + target);
}}}
this could happen if getHintedEndpointMap(rm.key(), naturalEndpoints) returns only elements for which target.equals(hintedTarget) returns false, which seems possible to me.
Looking at the code I get the feeling the reference should probably be to 'hintedMessage', instead of "unhintedMessage", if not so an
assert statement could be appropriate
