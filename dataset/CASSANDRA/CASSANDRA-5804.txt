Summary:
AntiEntropySession fails when OutboundTcpConnection receives IOException
Description:
When requesting merkle trees for a repair, if the OutboundTcpConnection grabbed from the connection pool is reset (java.io.IOException: Connection reset by peer), the target node is not marked as dead, the TREE_REQUEST is not retried, and the repair does not fail. Instead, the repair stalls waiting for the merkle tree response which will never arrive.
