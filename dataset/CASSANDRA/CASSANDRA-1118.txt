Summary:
allow overriding existing token owner with a new IP
Description:
We'd like to support replacing one node with another at the same IP (e.g. when the data is on Amazon's EBS and can easily be mounted to a new host), as noted in CASSANDRA-872. But in practice this is reported to not work w/o a cluster restart (can't find the ML thread now ... ?)
