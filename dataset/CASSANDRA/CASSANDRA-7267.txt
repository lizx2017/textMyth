Summary:
Embedded sets in user defined data-types are not updating
Description:
Hi,
i just played around with Cassandra 2.1.0 beta2 and i might have found an issue with embedded Sets in User Defined Data Types.
Here is how i can reproduce it:
1.) Create a keyspace "test"
2.) Create a table like this:
create table songs (title varchar PRIMARY KEY, band varchar, tags Set<varchar>);
3.) Create a udt like this:
create type band_info_type (founded timestamp, members Set<varchar>, description text);
4.) Try to insert data:
insert into songs (title, band, band_info, tags) values ('The trooper', 'Iron Maiden', {founded:188694000, members: {'Bruce Dickinson', 'Dave Murray', 'Adrian Smith', 'Janick Gers', 'Steve Harris', 'Nicko McBrain'}, description: 'Pure evil metal'}, {'metal', 'england'});
5.) Select the data:
select * from songs;
Returns this:
The trooper | Iron Maiden | {founded: '1970-01-03 05:24:54+0100', members: {}, description: 'Pure evil metal'} | {'england', 'metal'}
The embedded data-set seems to empty. I also tried updating a row which also does not seem to work.
Regards,
Thomas
