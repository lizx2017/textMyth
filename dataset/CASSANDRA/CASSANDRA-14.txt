Summary:
The initial arrive time should not be set to zero
Description:
In line 253 of src.org.apache.cassandra.gms .FailureDetector, the initial arrive time should not be zero. Otherwise, the failure detector would report the new joining node as dead because the phi is positive infinity when the mean of arrive time is zero.
A proper value should be set as the initial value. I use half of the gossip period as the initial value, whose default configuration is 1000ms.
