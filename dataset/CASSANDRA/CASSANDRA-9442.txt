Summary:
Pig tests failing in 2.2 and trunk
Description:
In CQLRecordWriter, we are catching and handling a certain class of exception. Unfortunately, we are still setting lastException, so hadoop reports that the map reduce job has errored out and failed, even though it succeeded.
We are also having an occasional issue where the driver returns a different interrupt related exception than what we are checking for. I have moved the check logic out into a separate function, and now check for both.
