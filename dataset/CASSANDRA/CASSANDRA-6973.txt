Summary:
timestamp data type does ISO 8601 formats with 'Z' as time zone.
Description:
The timestamp data type does not support format where time zone is specified with 'Z' (as in zulu aka. UTC+0 aka +0000 time zone). Example:
create table foo(ts timestamp primary key);
insert into foo(ts) values('2014-04-01T20:17:35+0000'); – this works
cqlsh:test> insert into foo(ts) values('2014-04-01T20:17:35Z');
Bad Request: unable to coerce '2014-04-01T20:17:35Z' to a formatted date (long)
The example date was copied directly from ISO 8601 Wikipedia page. The standard says that "If the time is in UTC, add a Z directly after the time without a space. Z is the zone designator for the zero UTC offset."
Tested with cqlsh with 2.0.6 version.
