Summary:
ColumnFamilyInputFormat demands OrderPreservingPartitioner when specifying InputRange with tokens
Description:
When ColumnFamilyInputFormat starts getting splits (via getSplits(...) [ColumnFamilyInputFormat.java:101]) it checks to see if a `jobKeyRange` has been set. If it has been set it attempts to set the `jobRange`. However the if block (ColumnFamilyInputFormat.java:124) looks to see if the `jobKeyRange` has tokens but asserts that the OrderPreservingPartitioner must be in use.
This if block should be looking for keys (not tokens). Code further down (ColumnFamilyInputFormat.java:147) already manages the range if tokens are used but can never be reached.
