Summary:
resumable_bootstrap_test can hang
Description:
The bootstrap_test.TestBootstrap.resumable_bootstrap_test can hang sometimes. It looks like the following line never completes:
node3.watch_log_for("Listening for thrift clients...")
I'm not familiar enough with the recent bootstrap changes to know why that's not happening.
