Summary:
JAVA_HOME on cassandra-env.sh is ignored on Debian packages
Description:
I've just got upgraded to 2.0.1 package from the apache repositories using apt. I had the JAVA_HOME environment variable set in /etc/cassandra/cassandra-env.sh but after the upgrade it only worked by setting it on /usr/sbin/cassandra script. I can't configure java 7 system wide, only for cassandra.
Off-toppic: Thanks for getting rid of the jsvc mess.
