Summary:
updating a row with compound key with a null value removes the entire row
Description:
create a table
CREATE TABLE relation (
u1 bigint,
u2 bigint,
mf int,
PRIMARY KEY (u1, u2));
insert value:
UPDATE relation SET mf = 1 WHERE u1 = 1 and u2 = 2;
SELECT * from relation ;
u1 | u2 | mf
--------
1 | 2 | 1
insert null value:
UPDATE relation SET mf = null WHERE u1 = 1 and u2 = 2;
SELECT * from relation ;
(0 rows) <--- WRONG!
The INSERT statement however works:
INSERT INTO relation (u1, u2, mf) VALUES (1, 2, null);
SELECT * from relation ;
u1 | u2 | mf
----------
1 | 2 | null
(1 rows)
