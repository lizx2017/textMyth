Summary:
StorageProxy static initialization not triggered until thrift requests come in
Description:
While plugging in the metrics library for CASSANDRA-3671 I realized (because the metrics library was trying to add a shutdown hook on metric creation) that starting cassandra and simply shutting it down, causes StorageProxy to not be initialized until the drain shutdown hook.
Effects:
StorageProxy mbean missing in visualvm/jconsole after initial startup (seriously, I thought I was going nuts )
And in general anything that makes assumptions about running early, or at least not during JVM shutdown, such as the metrics library, will be problematic
