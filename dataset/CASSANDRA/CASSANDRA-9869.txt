Summary:
windows - failed testClearEphemeralSnapshots
Description:
Did some juggling to get the state cleared/prepped when I wrote the test but apparently it's intermittently failing with the following:
junit.framework.AssertionFailedError
 at org.apache.cassandra.db.WindowsFailedSnapshotTracker.handleFailedSnapshot(WindowsFailedSnapshotTracker.java:104)
 at org.apache.cassandra.db.Directories.clearSnapshot(Directories.java:741)
 at org.apache.cassandra.db.ColumnFamilyStore.clearEphemeralSnapshots(ColumnFamilyStore.java:2343)
 at org.apache.cassandra.db.ColumnFamilyStoreTest.testClearEphemeralSnapshots(ColumnFamilyStoreTest.java:1555)
I assume it's something trivial (having not yet looked into it at all).
