Summary:
CommitLogTest hangs intermittently in 2.0
Description:
Possibly related to CASSANDRA-8992 ?
2.0 unit tests are hanging periodically in the same way (I have not gone through all the branches, so can't say we're in the clear everywhere - marking for just 2.x at the moment). CommitLogTest hung system.log attached from local reproduction.
