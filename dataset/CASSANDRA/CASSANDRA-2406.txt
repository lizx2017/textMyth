Summary:
Secondary index and index expression problems
Description:
When I iteratively get data with secondary index and index clause, result of data acquired by consistency level "one" is different from the one by consistency level "quorum". The one by consistecy level "one" is correct result. But the one by consistecy level "quorum" is incorrect and is dropped by Cassandra.
You can reproduce the bug by executing attached programs.
1. Start Cassandra cluster. It consists of 3 cassandra nodes and distributes data by ByteOrderedPartitioner. Initial tokens of those nodes are ["31", "32", "33"].
2. Create keyspace and column family, according to "create_table.cli",
3. Execute "secondary_index_insertv2.py", inserting a few hundred columns to cluster
4. Execute "secondary_index_checkv2.py" and get data with secondary index and index clause iteratively. "secondary_index_insertv2.py" and "secondary_index_checkv2.py" require pycassa.
You will be able to execute 4th "secondary_index_checkv2.py" script with following option so that
you get data with consistency level "one".
% python "secondary_index_checkv2.py" -one
On the other hand, to acquire data with consistency level "quorum", you will need to use following option.
% python "secondary_index_checkv2.py" -quorum
You can check that result of data acquired by consistency level "one" is different from one by consistency level "quorum".
