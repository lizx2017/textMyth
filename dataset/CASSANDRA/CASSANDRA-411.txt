Summary:
NOTICE.txt out of data for third-party libs
Description:
The Apache License 2.0 requires that attribution be included in a top-level NOTICE file. For Cassandra, and our ASF originated libraries, the standard "This product includes software developed by The Apache Software Foundation (http://www.apache.org/)." is sufficient, but attributions are missing for flexjson, clhm, and google-collect.
Patch to follow shortly.
