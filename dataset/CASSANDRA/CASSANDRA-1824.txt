Summary:
Schema only fully propagates from seeds
Description:
If you have nodes X, Y, and Z, and Y already has some schema, but X and Z do not, and X is the seed node for the cluster, X will pick up the schema from Y, but it will never propagate to Z. If X has the schema, it will propagate to both Y and Z.
