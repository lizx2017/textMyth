Summary:
Avoid possible sstable overlaps with leveled compaction
Description:
Two cases where we can end up with overlapping sstables in the leveled manifest;
FIrst one is when we skip levels during compaction. Here we need to make sure we are not compacting in newLevel - 1 since if, for example, we are doing a L1 -> L2 compaction and then start a new L0 compaction where we decide to skip L1, we could have overlapping sstables in L2 when the compactions are done. This case is new in 2.0 since we check if we skip levels before the compaction starts.
Second case is where we try to include as many overlapping L0 sstables as possible, here we could add sstables that are not compacting, but overlap sstables that are.
