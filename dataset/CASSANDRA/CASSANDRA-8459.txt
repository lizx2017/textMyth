Summary:
"autocompaction" on reads can prevent memtable space reclaimation
Description:
Memtable memory reclamation is dependent on reads always making progress, however on the collectTimeOrderedData critical path it is possible for the read to perform a write inline, and for this write to block waiting for memtable space to be reclaimed. However the reclaimation is blocked waiting for this read to complete.
There are a number of solutions to this, but the simplest is to make the defragmentation happen asynchronously, so the read terminates normally.
