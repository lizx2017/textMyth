Summary:
weakreadremote has high response return (>100ms)
Description:
When a client makes a request to a node where data does not live, it tries to fetch from a remote node. We noticed that in some JDK's the select() has very strange bugs. Right now under:
src/java/org/apache/cassandra/net/SelectorManager.java
run() {
..
select(100) should be changed to select(1);
}
