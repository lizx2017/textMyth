Summary:
Need to export JVM_OPTS from init.d script
Description:
Since 2.0, the init.d script was refactored and requires JVM variables to be exported for them to actually be picked up and used. In this case, JVM_OPTS never gets exported, so user defined variables from /etc/default/cassandra are never applied.
This also affects the latest 2.1 rc, and I assume all previous versions.
