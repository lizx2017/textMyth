Summary:
Tables created by cassandra-stress are omitted in DESCRIBE KEYSPACE
Description:
CASSANDRA-9374 modified cassandra-stress to only use CQL for creating its schema. This seems to work, as I'm testing on a cluster with start_rpc:false.
However, when I try to run a DESCRIBE on the schema it omits the tables, complaining that they were created with a "legacy API":
cqlsh> DESCRIBE KEYSPACE keyspace1 ;

CREATE KEYSPACE keyspace1 WITH replication = {'class': 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor': '1'}  AND durable_writes = true;

/*
Warning: Table keyspace1.counter1 omitted because it has constructs not compatible with CQL (was created via legacy API).

Approximate structure, for reference:
(this should not be used to reproduce this schema)

CREATE TABLE keyspace1.counter1 (
    key blob PRIMARY KEY,
    "C0" counter,
    "C1" counter,
    "C2" counter,
    "C3" counter,
    "C4" counter
) WITH COMPACT STORAGE
    AND bloom_filter_fp_chance = 0.01
    AND caching = '{"keys":"ALL", "rows_per_partition":"NONE"}'
    AND comment = ''
    AND compaction = {'min_threshold': '4', 'class': 'org.apache.cassandra.db.compaction.SizeTieredCompactionStrategy', 'max_threshold': '32'}
    AND compression = {}
    AND dclocal_read_repair_chance = 0.1
    AND default_time_to_live = 0
    AND gc_grace_seconds = 864000
    AND max_index_interval = 2048
    AND memtable_flush_period_in_ms = 0
    AND min_index_interval = 128
    AND read_repair_chance = 0.0
    AND speculative_retry = '99.0PERCENTILE';

cqlsh> 
Note that it attempts to describe them anyway, but they are commented out and shouldn't be used to restore from.
This is the ccm workflow I used to test this
