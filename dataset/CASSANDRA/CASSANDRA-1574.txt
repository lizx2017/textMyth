Summary:
Bootstrapping is broken
Description:
Bootstrap doesn't block for streaming requests which means nodetool move isn't blocking. More importantly bootstrap fails to call finishBootstrapping if no stream requests are ever made. This means its impossible to perform moves if you have no keyspaces.
