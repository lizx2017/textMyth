Summary:
Select * is only returning the first page of data on trunk
Description:
While doing some testing on the validation harness, I have run into a pretty trivially reproducible problem.
ccm create test -v git:trunk -n 1 -s
ccm node1 stress write n=2M
ccm node1 cqlsh
Use keyspace1;
Select * From standard1; (100 rows)
Select count(*) from standard1; (300 rows)
Despite two million rows being written, I have found that select * from standard1 only returns one page's worth of data. I have used both the java and the python driver to test this. I have also found that select count from standard1 gives a multiple of one page's worth of data, that appears to correspond to page size * RF.
I have already tried with the patch for CASSANDRA-9775, and that did not resolve this issue.
