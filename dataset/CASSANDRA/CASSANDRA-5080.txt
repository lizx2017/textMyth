Summary:
cassandra-cli doesn't support JMX authentication.
Description:
It seems that cassandra-cli doesn't support JMX user authentication.
Specifically I went about securing our Cassandra cluster slightly – I've added cassandra-level authentication (which cassandra-cli does support), but then I discovered that nodetool is still completely unprotected. So I went ahead and secured JMX (via -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.password.file and -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.access.file). Nodetool supports JMX authentication via -u and -pw options.
However it seems that cassandra-cli doesn't support JMX authentication, e.g.:
apache-cassandra-1.1.6\bin>cassandra-cli -h hostname -u experiment -pw password

help connect; and cassandra-cli --help do not seem to indicate that there's any way to specify JMX login information.
