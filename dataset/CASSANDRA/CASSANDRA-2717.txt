Summary:
duplicate rows returned from SELECT where KEY term is duplicated
Description:
Noticed while working on CASSANDRA-2268 when random keys generated during a mutli_get test contain duplicate keys.
The thrift multiget_slice() returns only the unique rows because of the map generated for the result.
CQL will return a row for each KEY term in the SELECT.
I could make QueryProcessor.getSlice() only create commands for the unique keys if we wanted to.
Not sure it's a bug and it's definitely not something that should come up to often, reporting it because it's different to the thrift mutli_get operation.
Happy to close if it's by design.
