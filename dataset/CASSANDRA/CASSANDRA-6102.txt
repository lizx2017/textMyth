Summary:
CassandraStorage broken for bigints and ints
Description:
I am seeing something rather strange in the way Cass 1.2 + Pig seem to handle integer values.
Setup: Cassandra 1.2.10, OSX 10.8, JDK 1.7u40, Pig 0.11.1. Single node for testing this.
First a table:
> CREATE TABLE testc (
 key text PRIMARY KEY,
 ivalue int,
 svalue text,
 value bigint
) WITH COMPACT STORAGE;

> insert into testc (key,ivalue,svalue,value) values ('foo',10,'bar',65);
> select * from testc;

key | ivalue | svalue | value
-----+--------+--------+-------
foo |     10 |    bar |     65
For my Pig setup, I then use libraries from different C* versions to actually talk to my database (which stays on 1.2.10 all the time).
Cassandra 1.0.12 (using cassandra_storage.jar):
testc = LOAD 'cassandra://keyspace/testc' USING CassandraStorage();
dump testc
(foo,(svalue,bar),(ivalue,10),(value,65),{})
Cassandra 1.1.10:
testc = LOAD 'cassandra://keyspace/testc' USING CassandraStorage();
dump testc
(foo,(svalue,bar),(ivalue,10),(value,65),{})
Cassandra 1.2.10:
(testc = LOAD 'cassandra://keyspace/testc' USING CassandraStorage();
dump testc
foo,{(ivalue,
),(svalue,bar),(value,A)})
To me it appears that ints and bigints are interpreted as ascii values in cass 1.2.10. Did something change for CassandraStorage, is there a regression, or am I doing something wrong? Quick perusal of the JIRA didn't reveal anything that I could directly pin on this.
Note that using compact storage does not seem to affect the issue, though it obviously changes the resulting pig format.
In addition, trying to use Pygmalion
tf = foreach testc generate key, flatten(FromCassandraBag('ivalue,svalue,value',columns)) as (ivalue:int,svalue:chararray,lvalue:long);
dump tf

(foo,
,bar,A)
So no help there. Explicitly casting the values to (long) or (int) just results in a ClassCastException.
