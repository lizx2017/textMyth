Summary:
Debian packaging should auto-detect the JVM, not require OpenJDK
Description:
The current init.d script for Debian-packaged Cassandra has the OpenJDK's JAVA_HOME hard-coded in, making it impossible to use sun-java6 without modifying the file. Ideally it should use the same sort of auto-detection logic used by other Debian-packaged Java projects to figure out which JVM it should use.
(I have a patch for this that I'll upload shortly.)
