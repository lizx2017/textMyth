Summary:
PropertyFileSnitch default DC/Rack behavior is broken in 1.2
Description:
CASSANDRA-4728 added a check that the local node was in the property file but didn't took a potential default into account.
Typically, using the shipped cassandra-topology.properties (that has a default DC and rack) with a node on localhost raises a ConfigurationException on startup).
