Summary:
SSTableRewriter.abort() should be more robust to failure
Description:
This fixes a bug introduced in CASSANDRA-8124 that attempts to open early during abort, introducing a failure risk. This patch further preempts CASSANDRA-8690 to wrap every rollback action in a try/catch block, so that any internal assertion checks do not actually worsen the state.
