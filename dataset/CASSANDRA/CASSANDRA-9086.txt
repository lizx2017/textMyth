Summary:
CAS precondition mismatch - row is still inserted
Description:
Cassandra claims CAS precondition didn't match current values[1], but the row is still inserted.
We are having a quite simple cf schema:
create table index (
  u text PRIMARY KEY,
  abc set<uuid>,
) WITH
  compaction={'class': 'LeveledCompactionStrategy'};
CQL statement:
INSERT INTO index(u, abc) VALUES(?, ?) IF NOT EXISTS
Sometimes, especially during some write load, Cassandra claims the conditional insert wasn't satisfied ([applied] false), but the row is still inserted.
The response from the conditional insert contains [applied]=false + the data we tried to insert.
A full CQL trace is attached.
