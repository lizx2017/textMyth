Summary:
Move crc_check_chance out of compressions options
Description:
Follow up to CASSANDRA-8384. The option doesn't belong to compression params - it doesn't affect compression, itself, and isn't passed to compressors upon initialization.
While it's true that it is (currently) only being honored when reading compressed sstables, it still doesn't belong to compression params (and is causing CASSANDRA-7978 -like issues).
T Jake Luciani suggested we should make it an option of its own, and I think we should.
