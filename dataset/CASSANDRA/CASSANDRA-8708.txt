Summary:
inter_dc_stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec to defaults to unlimited
Description:
inter_dc_stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec was introduced in CASSANDRA-6596.
There's some discussion in the ticket of the intention to link the default to whatever stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec is set to.
However, it looks like it's just set to 0 - from /src/java/org/apache/cassandra/config/Config.java
This is a bit of a pain - usually folks want to set the inter dc limits lower than the base streaming figure.
