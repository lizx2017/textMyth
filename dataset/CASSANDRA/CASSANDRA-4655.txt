Summary:
Truncate operation doesn't delete rows from HintsColumnFamily.
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Start writing of data to some column family, let name it 'MyCF'
2. Stop 1 node
3. Wait some time (until some data will be collected in HintsColumnFamily)
4. Start node (HintedHandoff will be started automatically for 'MyCF')
5. Run 'truncate' command for 'MyCF' column family from command from cli
6. Wait until truncate will be finished
7. You will see that 'MyCF' is not empty because HintedHandoff is copying data
So, I suggest to clean HintsColumnFamily (for truncated column family) before we had started to discard sstables.
I think it should be done in CompactionManager#submitTrucate() method. I can try to create patch but I need to know right way of cleaning HintsColumnFamily. Could you clarify it?
