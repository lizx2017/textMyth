Summary:
avoid maybeResolveForRepair twice
Description:
In ReadCallback maybeResolveForRepair maybe executed twice. For example, endpoints.size = 3, blockfor = 2. At the moment the second response triggers maybeResolveForRepair, the third one coming increments the received variable which equals 3. As a result, two repairs are produced. This is a tiny problem we can fix easily.
