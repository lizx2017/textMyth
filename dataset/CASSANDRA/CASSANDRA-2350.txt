Summary:
Races between schema changes and StorageService operations
Description:
I only tested this on 0.7.0, but it judging by the 0.7.3 code (latest I've looked at) the same thing should happen.
The case in particular that I ran into is this: I force a compaction for all CFs in a keyspace, and while the compaction is happening I add another CF to the keyspace. I get the following exception because the underlying set of CFs has changed while being iterated over.

The problem is a little more fundamental than that, though, as I believe any schema change of CFs in the keyspace during one of these operations (e.g. flush, compaction, etc) has the potential to cause a race. I'm not sure what would happen if the set of CFs to compact was acquired and one of them was dropped before it had been compacted.
