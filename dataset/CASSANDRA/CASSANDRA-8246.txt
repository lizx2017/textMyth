Summary:
Default timestamp for QueryOptions should be Long.MIN_VALUE
Description:
CASSANDRA-8139 adds proper handling for negative timestamps, but one case was missed in the merge to cassandra-2.1.
QueryOptions.SpecificOptions.DEFAULT is still created with a timestamp of -1, so statements which do not come in via the native protocol will retain this timestamp and not be assigned a server-side timestamp at execution time.QueryOptions.Codec does the right thing, so statements that do come via the protocol are unaffected.
