Summary:
Schedule schema pulls onChange
Description:
The dtest suite is running a test which creates a 3 node cluster, then adds a keyspace and column family. For some reason the 3 nodes are not agreeing on the schema version. The problem is intermittent â€“ either the nodes all agree on schema quickly, or they seem to stay stuck in limbo.
The simplest way to reproduce is to run the dtest (simple_increment_test):
https://github.com/riptano/cassandra-dtest/blob/master/counter_tests.py
using nosetests:
nosetests -vs counter_tests.py:TestCounters.simple_increment_test
If the problem is reproduced nose will return this:
ProgrammingError: Bad Request: Keyspace 'ks' does not exist
I am not yet sure if the bug is reproducible outside of the dtest suite.
