Summary:
CassandraStorage uses comparator for both super column names and sub column names.
Description:
The CassandraStorage class uses the same comparator for super and sub column names.
This is because it calls columnsToTuple recursively without any indication that the subsequent call is for sub columns. Also, the getDefaultMarshallers method does not return the sub column name comparator.
