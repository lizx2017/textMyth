Summary:
PreparedStatements get mixed up between Keyspaces
Description:
I found this behavior while running the same application using two different keyspaces connected to the same node.
The prepared statements uses the keyspace that was set while the statement was perpared (public final CFDefinition cfDef).
When reusing the Statement only the cql-query is used to create a key and the keyspace is ignored. When the same query is prepared and used for two different Keyspaces the wrong keyspace can be used.
The fix is not to ignore the keyspace when reusing the statement.
