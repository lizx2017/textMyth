Summary:
IndexHelper.skipBloomFilters won't skip non-SHA filters
Description:
Currently, if the bloom filter is not of SHA type, we do not properly skip the bytes. We need to read out the number of bytes, as happens in the Murmur deserializer, then skip that many bytes instead of just skipping the hash size. The version needs to be passed into the method as well, so that it knows what type of index it is, and does the appropriate skipping.
