Summary:
Dead code: net/HeaderTypes.java
Description:
Class o.a.c.net.HeaderTypes is not used anywhere, and, even though public, is of dubious value, because it only contains a couple of constants and no code. Googling resulted in no hits other than from this source file.
Searching commit history didn't uncover any reasons for its continued existence, so that whole file can be safely removed.
