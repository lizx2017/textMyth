Summary:
Only consider whole row tombstone in collation controller
Description:
CollationController has that optimization that if it has already seen a row tombstone more recent that a sstable max timestamp, it skips the sstable. However, this was not updated correctly while introducing range tombstone and currently the code might skip a sstable based on the timestamp of a tombstone that does not cover the full row.
