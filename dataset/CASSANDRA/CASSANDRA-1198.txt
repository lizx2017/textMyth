Summary:
In a cluster, get_range_slices() does not return all the keys it should
Description:
Row iteration with get_range_slices() does not return all keys. This behaviour only occurs with more than one node and depends on how the nodes are located on the ring.
To reproduce, insert some records into a cluster with more than one node. A subsequent row iteration will return fewer records than were inserted. This has been observed when 1) inserting into a single node, bootstrapping a second node then using get_range_slices() and 2) inserting into a cluster of several nodes then using get_range_slices().
This appears to be similar to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-781
