Summary:
fix OOM with ReadMessageTest.testNoCommitLog
Description:
this test can throw OOMs, because it uses a FileReader and readLine to read the commit log. However, some commit logs are fully allocated, but not initialized, (all 0s) so finding an EOL means reading 134M of data. Even for commit logs that have data they really aren't filereader-type streams.
changed to do simple byte finding in the streams instead.
