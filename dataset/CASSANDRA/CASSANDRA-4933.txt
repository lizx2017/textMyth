Summary:
SimpleAuthority is incompatible with new Permissions and "resources lists"
Description:
Commit aba5a37650232dbf10b505c04b257f73b6c9b579 by Pavel Yaskevich introduced some significant changes in Permissions system. Except new permission types, also resource hierarchy has changed - previously creating a keyspace was requesting for for WRITE permission for /cassandra/keyspaces. Now it requests for CREATE permission for /cassandra/keyspaces/<new-keyspace-name>. This change brakes the SimpleAuthority code that relies on the length of the resource list which differs now - we cannot distinguish operations that modify keyspaces (perviously: resource list of length 2; currently: 3) from these ones that read it or so (resource list of length 3).
I've prepared a patch that fixes it in the way that I understand it should work now (comment in 1.1.6's IAuthority.java is out of date and refers to old READ/WRITE permissions only).
Yes, I know that SimpleAuth(enticator/ority) are deprecated, should not be used in production and so on, but even if they are unsufficient as a protection from external threats, they're still good enough in our case as a very basic protection from accidental changes made by developers
