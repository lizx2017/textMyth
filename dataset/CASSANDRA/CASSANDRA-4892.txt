Summary:
no need to keep tombstones in HintsColumnFamily
Description:
Once a hint is delivered, it is removed from the HintsColumnFamily. Because it is local and would only be deleted after expiration or after a correct delivery, there is no need to keep any tombstones (i.e. gc_grace_seconds should be zero)
