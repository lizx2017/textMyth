Summary:
Gossiper blocks when updating tokens and turns node down
Description:
The GossipStage call to SystemTable.updateTokens causes a blocking memtable flush that may get stuck in the postFlushExecutor queue while waiting for other memtables to flush; as a consequence, the Gossiper itself "blocks" and the node is turned down.
