Summary:
sstablemetadata{.bat} location inconsistency
Description:
tools/bin has sstablemetadata and sstablemetadata.bat https://github.com/apache/cassandra/tree/cassandra-2.0/bin
while bin has only sstablemetadata.bat https://github.com/apache/cassandra/tree/cassandra-2.0/bin
This is confusing. Not sure which is intended.
