Summary:
auto bootstrapping a node into a cluster without a schema silently fails
Description:
from http://www.mail-archive.com/user@cassandra.apache.org/msg13001.html
StorageService.joinRing() aborts the auto bootstrap process if the cluster does not have a schema defined. It looks like the node is left in the "Joining" mode and there is no logging.
There could be a schema defined and no data loaded, so just having a schema does not make the token selection any better. And BootStrapper.bootstrap() handles their been no non system tables.
Can we let the bootstrap process continue ?
