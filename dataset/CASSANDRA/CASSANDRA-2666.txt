Summary:
nodetool repair silently fails (no non-zero exit code) when repair did not happen
Description:
In this particular example I tested with a neighbor down. system.log correctly reports:
INFO [manual-repair-65fb7826-77ae-4ad6-99e3-5aa94b03b97d] 2011-05-19 14:48:53,476 AntiEntropyService.java (line 767) Could not proceed on repair because a neighbor (/XX.XX.XX.XX) is dead: manual-repair-65fb7826-77ae-4ad6-99e3-5aa94b03b97d failed.
But "nodetool -h localhost repair || echo fail" doesn't print fail.
