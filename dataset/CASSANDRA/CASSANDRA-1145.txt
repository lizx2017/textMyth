Summary:
Reading with CL > ONE returns multiple copies of the same column per key.
Description:
Testing with 0.6-trunk today:
Reading with CL > ONE returns multiple copies of the same column per key consistent with the replicas queried before return. i.e, for RC=3, a QUORUM read yields 2 copies and an ALL read returns 3.
This is with pycassa get_range() which is using get_range_slice()
I see the same behavior with 0.6.1 and 0.6.2 debs
If my experience is not unique, anyone using get_range_slice is now deluged with duplicate data.
