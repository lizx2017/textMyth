Summary:
LeveledCompaction has several performance problems
Description:
Two main problems:
BF size calculation doesn't take into account LCS breaking the output apart into "bite sized" sstables, so memory use is much higher than predicted
ManyToMany merging is slow. At least part of this is from running the full reducer machinery against single input sources, which can be optimized away.
