Summary:
Fix AsyncOneResponse
Description:
Current implementation of AsyncOneResponse suffers from two problems:
1. Spurious wakeup will lead to TimeoutException being thrown because awaiting for condition is not done in loop;
2. condition.signal() is used where .signalAll() should be used - this leads to only one thread blocked on .get() to be unblocked. Other threads will stay blocked forever.
