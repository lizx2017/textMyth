Summary:
start_column in get_page_slice has odd behaivor
Description:
get_paged_slice is described as so:
 /**
   returns a range of columns, wrapping to the next rows if necessary to collect max_results.
  */
  list<KeySlice> get_paged_slice(1:required string column_family,
                                 2:required KeyRange range,
                                 3:required binary start_column,
                                 4:required ConsistencyLevel consistency_level=ConsistencyLevel.ONE)
                 throws (1:InvalidRequestException ire, 2:UnavailableException ue, 3:TimedOutException te),
The term max_results is not defined, I take it to mean key_range.count.
The larger issue I have found is that start_column seems to be ignored in some cases.
testNormal() produces this error
junit.framework.ComparisonFailure: null expected:<[c]> but was:<[a]>
The problem seems to be KeyRanges that use tokens and not keys.
KeyRange kr = new KeyRange();
      kr.setCount(3);
      kr.setStart_token("");
      kr.setEnd_token("");   
A failing test is here:

Is this a bug? It feels like one, or is this just undefined behaviour. If it is a bug I would like to fix.
