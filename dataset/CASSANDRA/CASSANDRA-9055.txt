Summary:
FunctionExecutionException results in error log about unexpected error
Description:
Because FunctionExecutionException doesn't extend RequestExecutionException, a failure during the execution of a UDF will result in a error log in QueryMessage about "Unexpected error during query". It seems like the proper fix to make FEE extend REE.
This is responsible for the failure of the user_functions_test.TestUserFunctions.udf_scripting_test dtest.
