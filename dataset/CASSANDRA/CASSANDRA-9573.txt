Summary:
OOM when loading sstables (system.hints)
Description:
Andy Tolbert discovered an issue while running endurance tests on 2.2. A Node was not able to start and was killed by the OOM Killer.
Briefly, Cassandra use an excessive amount of memory when loading compressed sstables (off-heap?). We have initially seen the issue with system.hints before knowing it was related to compression. system.hints use lz4 compression by default. If we have a sstable of, say 8-10G, Cassandra will be killed by the OOM killer after 1-2 minutes. I can reproduce that bug everytime locally.
the issue also happens if we have 10G of data splitted in 13MB sstables.
I can reproduce the issue if I put a lot of data in the system.hints table.
I cannot reproduce the issue with a standard table using the same compression (LZ4). Something seems to be different when it's hints?
You wont see anything in the node system.log but you'll see this in /var/log/syslog.log:
Out of memory: Kill process 30777 (java) score 600 or sacrifice child
The issue has been introduced in this commit but is not related to the performance issue in CASSANDRA-9240: https://github.com/apache/cassandra/commit/aedce5fc6ba46ca734e91190cfaaeb23ba47a846
Here is the core dump and some yourkit snapshots in attachments. I am not sure you will be able to get useful information from them.
core dump: http://dl.alanb.ca/core.tar.gz
Not sure if this is related, but all dumps and snapshot points to EstimatedHistogramReservoir ... and we can see many javax.management.InstanceAlreadyExistsException: org.apache.cassandra.metrics:... exceptions in system.log before it hangs then crash.
To reproduce the issue:
1. created a cluster of 3 nodes
2. start the whole cluster
3. shutdown node2 and node3
4. writes 10-15G of data on node1 with replication factor 3. You should see a lot of hints.
5. stop node1
6. start node2 and node3
7. start node1, you should OOM.
