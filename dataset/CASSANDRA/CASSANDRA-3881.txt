Summary:
reduce computational complexity of processing topology changes
Description:
This constitutes follow-up work from CASSANDRA-3831 where a partial improvement was committed, but the fundamental issue was not fixed. The maximum "practical" cluster size was significantly improved, but further work is expected to be necessary as cluster sizes grow.
Edit0: Appended patch information.
Patches
Compare Raw diff Description
00_snitch_topology 00_snitch_topology.patch Adds some functionality to TokenMetadata to track which endpoints and racks exist in a DC.
01_calc_natural_endpoints 01_calc_natural_endpoints.patch Rewritten O(logN) implementation of calculateNaturalEndpoints using the topology information from the tokenMetadata.
Note: These are branches managed with TopGit. If you are applying the patch output manually, you will either need to filter the TopGit metadata files (i.e. wget -O - <url> | filterdiff -x*.topdeps -x*.topmsg | patch -p1), or remove them afterward (rm .topmsg .topdeps).
