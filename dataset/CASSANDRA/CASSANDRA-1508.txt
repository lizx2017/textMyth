Summary:
only attempt to set size on Linux (for portability)
Description:
-Xss128k causes the JVM to refuse to start or crash on 64 bit FreeBSD 8 (this goes for two wildly differing openjdk 1.6:es and for the current openjdk7 branch). Attaching patch to only pass -Xss on Linux.
The motivation here is that out-of-the-box behavior is important for first-comers, and for people in production on a non-Linux platform where -Xss128k would work are presumably committed enough that they can tweak this themselves.
