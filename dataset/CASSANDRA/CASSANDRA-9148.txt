Summary:
Issue when modifying UDT
Description:
I'm trying out the user defined types but ran into some issues when adding a column to an existing type.
Unfortunately I had to scrap the entire cluster so I cannot access it any more.
After creating the UDT i adde two tables using it. 1 was just using frozen<type>. The other was using both frozen<type> frozen map<String, type>.
Then I realized I needed to add a new field to the user type. Then when I tried to put to any of the two tables (setting all fields to the UDT in the datastax java driver) I got this error message that I could not find anywhere else but in the cassandra code:
com.datastax.driver.core.exceptions.InvalidQueryException: Invalid remaining data after end of UDT value
I had to scrap my keyspace in order to be able to use it again. Could not even drop one of the tables.
I know that they are frozen so we cannot modify the value of individual fields once they are written but we must be able to modify the schema right?
