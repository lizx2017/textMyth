Summary:
Fix validation of collections in TriggerExecutor
Description:
TriggerExecutor.validate uses o.a.c.cql.QueryProcessor (i.e. the cql2 version) to validate cells in generated mutations. This suffers from the same issue with collections as described in CASSANDRA-7665.
With cql2 being removed in 3.0, TriggerExecutor in trunk does the right thing and uses the Cell's validateFields method, so we should just do the same thing in 2.1.
