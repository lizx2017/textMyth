Summary:
Schema change notifications sent for no-op DDL statements
Description:
When schema changes are made with IF [NOT] EXISTS conditions, we return schema change messages (and push out schema change notifications) even if the IF [NOT] EXISTS condition makes it a no-op.
This results in extra work for native protocol drivers, which typically wait for schema agreement and refresh their schema metadata when schema changes occur.
