Summary:
Race condition issue during upgrading 1.1 to 1.2
Description:
There is a race condition during upgrading a C* 1.1x cluster to C* 1.2.
One issue is that OutboundTCPConnection can't establish from a 1.2 node to some 1.1x nodes. Because of this, a live cluster during the upgrading will suffer in high read latency and be unable to fulfill some write requests. It won't be a problem if there is a small cluster but it is a problem in a large cluster (100+ nodes) because the upgrading process takes 10+ hours to 1+ day(s) to complete.
Acknowledging about CASSANDRA-5692, however, it does not fully fix the issue. We already have a patch for this and will attach shortly for feedback.
