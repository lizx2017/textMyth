Summary:
flood of "setting live ratio to maximum of 64" from repair
Description:
we are on 2.0.8
running with repair -pr -local <KS>, all nodes on i2.2x (60G ram);, with setting 8G of heap. Using java 8. (key cache size is 1G)
On occasion, when repair is run, the C* that run the repair, or another node in the cluster, or both, run into a bad state with the system.log just printing ""setting live ratio to maximum of 64" forever every split seconds. It usually happens when repairing one of the larger/wider CF.
WARN [MemoryMeter:1] 2014-06-28 09:13:24,540 Memtable.java (line 470) setting live ratio to maximum of 64.0 instead of Infinity
INFO [MemoryMeter:1] 2014-06-28 09:13:24,540 Memtable.java (line 481) CFS(Keyspace='RIQ', ColumnFamily='MemberTimeline') liveRatio is 64.0 (just-counted was 64.0). calculation took 0ms for 0 cells

Just to give an idea of how bad this is, the log file is set to rotate 50 times with 21M each. In less than 15 minutes, all the logs are filled up with just that log. C* is not responding, and can't be killed normally. Only way is to kill -9
