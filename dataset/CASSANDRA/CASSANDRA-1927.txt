Summary:
Hadoop Integration doesn't work when one node is down
Description:
using the same directives in the sample code:
When I start the CFInputFormat to read a CF in a keyspace of RF=3 on a 4-node cluster:
If all the nodes are all up, everything works fine and I don't have any problems walking through the all data in the CF, however
If there's a node down, the hadoop job does not even start, just dies without any errors or exceptions.
So I'm really sorry for not being able to post any errors or exceptions, though it's really easy to reproduce. Just startup a cluster and take one node down and you're there
