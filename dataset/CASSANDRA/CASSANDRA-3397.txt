Summary:
Problem markers don't show up in Eclipse
Description:
The generated Eclipse files install an Ant Builder to build Cassandra within Eclipse. This appears to mean that the default Java Builder is not present. This means that no problem markers show up in the Problem view or the Package Explorer etc when there are compiler errors or warnings - you have to study the console output, then navigate manually to the sources of the problems, which is very tedious.
It seems to be possible to re-install the default Java Builder in parallel with the Ant Builder, getting the best of both worlds. I have documented this on the wiki at http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/RunningCassandraInEclipse
I was wondering a) whether this can be done automatically by the generate-eclipse-files Ant target, and b) whether using both Builders will be problem if one is working on any of the generated code (Thrift, CQL etc). The Java Builder can be temporarily disabled if so by unticking it under Properties->Builders...
