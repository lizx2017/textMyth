Summary:
cassandra-cli doesn't allow hyphens in hostnames
Description:
It's not possible to use a hostname that contains a hyphen with the "connect" command interactively, (the parser does not accept hostnames that contain hyphens).
Note: It is still possible to connect to such hosts by passing it on the command line using -host.
