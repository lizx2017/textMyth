Summary:
Cql3 reader returns duplicate rows if the cluster column is reversed
Description:
To reproduce it,

title | occurances | word
------------------------
alex123 | 4 | liu3
alex1 | 23456 | liu2
alex10 | 10 | liu10
alex12 | 34 | liu3
alex | 123456 | liu1
alex | 1000 | liu
CREATE TABLE wordfreq ( title text, word text, occurances int, PRIMARY KEY (title,occurances)) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER by (occurances DESC);
The hadoop job returns 7 rows instead of 6 rows.
I will post a patch soon.
