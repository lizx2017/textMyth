Summary:
Stop inheriting liveRatio/computedAt from previous memtables
Description:
CASSANDRA-6945 helped to reduce the risk of calculating an outlier liveRatio value, and having to stick with it for a long time, by making liveRatio per-memtable and not per-cf.
The added optimization of inheriting liveRatio/calculatedAt to minimize recalculations, however, took us a step back to before CASSANDRA-6945.
I suggest we get rid of inheriting the old values altogether, but reduce the rate of recalculation by demanding 10x increase in ops to trigger recalc, instead of the previous 2x.
