Summary:
Secondary index still does minor compacting after deleting index
Description:
We deleted all of our secondary indexes. A couple of days later I was watching compactionstats on one of the nodes and it was in the process of minor compacting one of the deleted secondary indexes. I double checked the keyspace definitions on the CLI and there were no secondary indexes defined.
