Summary:
cfstats shows deleted cfs
Description:
cfstats shows deleted CFs inside the keyspace after the CF was deleted from the keyspace using thrift service call system_drop_column_family
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Setup a 3 node cluster with clean slate from trunc;
2. create a keyspace with rf=2 and a standard cf using service call system_add_keyspace
3. create another cf with system_add_column_family
4. batch_mutate some rows into the new column family you created in step 3
5. call describe_keyspace to get a list of cfs inside your KS
6. iterate through the result and call system_drop_column_family for each
7. look at cfstats result. it is still showing the very first cf we create in step 2 in the list
