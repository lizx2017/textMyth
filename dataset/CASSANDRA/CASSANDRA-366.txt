Invalid Java identified by JDK7 in StorageProxy.java
Description:
Per http://bugs.sun.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=6182950 the two dispatchMessage() methods in StorageProxy.java should not compile. JDK6 allows both to coexist, against the spec. JDK7 fixes this, resulting in a compilation error on StorageProxy.java
