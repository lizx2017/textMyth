Summary:
Include bootstrap targets in consistencylevel computations
Description:
We want to preserve ConsistencyLevel semantics during bootstrap, and if a CL.quorum/all write is sent to a bootstrap target, it would have to wait for the forwarded write to complete to report in turn that the write is good.
Leaving write propagation to be done by the write originator means we don't have this extra layer of latency.
