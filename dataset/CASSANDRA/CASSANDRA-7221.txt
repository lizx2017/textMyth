Summary:
CqlRecordReader does not work with Password authentication
Description:
CqlRecordReader initialises a cluster with:
cluster = CqlConfigHelper.getInputCluster(location, conf);
CqlConfigHelper gets class name for auth provider and then tries to initialise it without any parameter. PlainTextAuthProvider does not have no-args constructor, so it fails in this case. There is no other way to initialise CqlRecordReader with password authentication.
One solution which can be considered is to modify the method which instantiate auth provider, so that if it detects PlainTextAuthProvider, it will retrieve additional parameters to pass to the constructor. Or, it can be done more generic.
