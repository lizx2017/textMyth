Summary:
move confluence wiki to moin
Description:
I believe the project would be better served by Apache's moinmoin wiki. Here's why:
more consistent with other apache projects
better/easier to remember url, http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra vs. http://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CSDR/Index
uses a more mainstream markup that more people will be familiar with.
looks better (although I admit this is subjective)
there is at least one person willing to spend some time keeping it updated and accurate, and that person doesn't like confluence.
I've copied all of the content over. If there are no serious objections, I'd like to have the home page link to http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra, and the old wiki disabled.
