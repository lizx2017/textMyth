Summary:
Memory leak in SerializingCache
Description:
A customer reported a memory leak when off-heap row cache is enabled.
I gave them a patch against 1.1.9 to troubleshoot (https://github.com/jbellis/cassandra/commits/row-cache-finalizer). This confirms that row cache is responsible. Here is a sample of the log:
DEBUG [Finalizer] 2013-06-08 06:49:58,656 FreeableMemory.java (line 69) Unreachable memory still has nonzero refcount 1
DEBUG [Finalizer] 2013-06-08 06:49:58,656 FreeableMemory.java (line 71) Unreachable memory 140337996747792 has not been freed (will free now)
DEBUG [Finalizer] 2013-06-08 06:49:58,656 FreeableMemory.java (line 69) Unreachable memory still has nonzero refcount 1
DEBUG [Finalizer] 2013-06-08 06:49:58,656 FreeableMemory.java (line 71) Unreachable memory 140337989287984 has not been freed (will free now)
That is, memory is not being freed because we never got to zero references.
