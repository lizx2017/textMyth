Summary:
Static columns with IF NOT EXISTS don't always work as expected
Description:
Given:
CREATE TABLE test (
    id int,
    k text,
    version int static,
    v int,
    PRIMARY KEY (id, k)
)

INSERT INTO test(id, k, v) VALUES (1, 'foo', 'foo')
the following conditional update should not apply:
INSERT INTO test(id, k, version) VALUES (1, 'foo', 1) IF NOT EXISTS
since said query involves the clustering column and the CQL row with said clustering column already exists. It does currently apply however.
