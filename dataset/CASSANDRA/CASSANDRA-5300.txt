Summary:
Insufficient validation of UPDATE queries against counter cfs
Description:
CREATE TABLE demo (
  id int PRIMARY KEY,
  c counter
)
This is expected:
insert into demo (id, c) VALUES ( 0, 20);
Bad Request: INSERT statement are not allowed on counter tables, use UPDATE instead
This should also be forbidden, but it is not:
update demo set c = 20 where id = 0;
select * from demo;

 id | c
----+----
  0 | 20
