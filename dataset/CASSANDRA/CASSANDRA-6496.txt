Summary:
Endless L0 LCS compactions
Description:
I have first described the problem here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20589324/cassandra-2-0-3-endless-compactions-with-no-traffic
I think I have really abused my system with the traffic (mix of reads, heavy updates and some deletes). Now after stopping the traffic I see the compactions that are going on endlessly for over 4 days.
For a specific CF I have about 4700 sstable data files right now. The compaction estimates are logged as "[3312, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]". sstable_size_in_mb=256. 3214 files are about 256Mb (+/1 few megs), other files are smaller or much smaller than that. No sstables are larger than 256Mb. What I observe is that LCS picks 32 sstables from L0 and compacts them into 32 sstables of approximately the same size. So, what my system is doing for last 4 days (no traffic at all) is compacting groups of 32 sstables into groups of 32 sstables without any changes. Seems like a bug to me regardless of what did I do to get the system into this state...
