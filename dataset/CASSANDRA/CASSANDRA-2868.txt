Summary:
Native Memory Leak
Description:
We have memory issues with long running servers. These have been confirmed by several users in the user list. That's why I report.
The memory consumption of the cassandra java process increases steadily until it's killed by the os because of oom (with no swap)
Our server is started with -Xmx3000M and running for around 23 days.
pmap -x shows
Total SST: 1961616 (mem mapped data and index files)
Anon RSS: 6499640
Total RSS: 8478376
This shows that > 3G are 'overallocated'.
We will use BRAF on one of our less important nodes to check wether it is related to mmap and report back.
