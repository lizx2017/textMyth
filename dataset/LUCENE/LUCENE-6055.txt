Summary:
PayloadAttribute.clone() should deep clone its BytesRef
Description:
PayloadAttribute.clone() does a shallow clone, unlike e.g. CharTermAttribute. Attributes should deep clone, otherwise capturing state isn't correct. In addition, both PA's and CTA's .clone() falsely documents that they do shallow cloning on purposes, so need to fix that too.
