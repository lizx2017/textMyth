Summary:
LatLonPoint newPolygonQuery should use two-phase iterator
Description:
Currently, the calculation this thing does is very expensive, and gets slower the more complex the polygon is. Doing everything in one phase is really bad for performance.
Later, there are a lot of optimizations we can do. But I think we should try to beef up testing first. This is just to improve from galapagos-tortoise-slow to turtle-slow.
