Summary:
NumericTokenStream.NumericTermAttribute does not support cloning -> Solr analysis request handlers fail
Description:
During converting Solr's AnalysisRequestHandlers (LUCENE-2374) I noticed, that the current implementation of NumericTokenStream fails on cloneAttributes(), which is needed to buffer the tokens for structured display.
This issue should fix this by refactoring the inner class.
