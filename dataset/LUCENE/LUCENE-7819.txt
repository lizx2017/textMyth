Summary:
404 not found wiki.apache.org/jakarta-lucene links not forwarded to lucene-java
Description:
Links with http://wiki.apache.org/jakarta-lucene/... are currently not being forwarded, and instead result in a plain 404 Not Found page.
Apparently they should be forwarded to http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/... since bug LUCENE-791 changed the path, and were being forwarded at that time.
Links that still contain 'jakarta-lucene' include links from JavaDoc and links from the wiki.apache.org top page.
To Reproduce:
Click on one of the jakarta-lucene URLs below.
Actual Result: 404 Not Found page
Expected Result: forwarded to corresponding lucene-java page.
