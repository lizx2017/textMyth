Summary:
encoding of GermanAnalyzer.java and GermanStemmer.java isn't utf-8
Description:
For PyLucene, the gcj/swig - based python integration of java lucene, it would
be good if java source files didn't use encodings other than utf-8.
On Windows - and systems without iconv support in general - compiling code
with gcj where the java source text is in another encoding than utf-8 is
difficult if not impossible.
To change the encoding on these files:
iconv -f iso-8859-1 -t utf-8 GermanAnalyzer.java > GermanAnalyzer.java.utf-8
iconv -f iso-8859-1 -t utf-8 GermanStemmer.java > GermanStemmer.java.utf-8
