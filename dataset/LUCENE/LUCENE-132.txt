Summary:
Add "an" to the English stop words
Description:
In org.apache.lucene.analysis.StopAnalyzer, the ENGLISH_STOP_WORDS array
contains "a" but not "an". So searching for "a fund" will get the same hits as
"fund", but searching for "an investment" will get many more hits than "investment".
This is true in the latest revision of the file, but appears to have always been
the case. I'm amazed nobody's pointed it out before now, our users had only
been testing for a few hours before they complained about it
