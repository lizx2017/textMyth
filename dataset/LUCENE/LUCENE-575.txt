Summary:
SpellChecker min score is increased by time
Description:
The minimum score, an instance variable, is modified in a search. That is wrong, since it makes it 1. thread unsafe and 2. not working.
Lucky enought it is only used from the one and same method call, so I simply compied the instance variable to a local method variable.
float min = this.min;
