Summary:
Query syntax.
Description:
Hi.
This mail is just the short report from my tests on Lucene:
Basically lets say I have two strings indexed:
1. ??
2. test??
Now report:
I wasn't able to find the first string by using any kind of query
(what I tried was: ??, ??)
the second string I found using following queries: test??, test??, tes???
but e.g. the queries tes???, test?? failed.
Regards
Dominik
