Summary:
Problem searching with WildCards and quotes
Description:
Hello,
When I'm trying to search in an index, and the query has wildcards and quotes
(see example), Lucene doesn't find hits. It is needed for example to search for
a String that has white spaces in it.
Exaple:
My index contains Document with field which its name is the string "0", and
value is the string "1234".
The following code works fine, and finds 1 hit:
Code:
String queryStr = "123*";
Query query = QueryParser.parse(queryStr, "0", new StandardAnalayzer());
Hits hits = myIndexSearcher.search(query);
System.out.println("Hits length: " + hits.length());
However, if the first line in the code will be:
String queryStr = "\"123*\"";
and not the original one (the string will have quotes in it (the first and last
characters are the character ")), the search won't find any hit!!!!
I've tried to put the * after the closing quote, or use parenthesis, but it
didn't help.
The quotes are important becasue I need the search with wildcards for strings
that have more than one word (for example "hello world"), and without quotes it
is impossible to search for it. However, with quotes ("\"hello w*\""), Lucene
doesn't find any hit. But then I've noticed that the problem isn't with the
white spaces, because you can see from my example that also without the white
space, there is no any hit.
Do you have a solution for it?
