Summary:
Running "ant jar-checksums" on Windows alters line endings on .sha1 files
Description:
On a Windows machine, I applied a patch to a fresh master checkout that changed the version of a component managed by Ivy. Then I ran "ant jar-checksums" to calculate a new sha1 checksum for the changed jar. A very large number of checksum files then mentioned line ending changes when I ran "git status".
IRC discussion:
12:58 <@elyograg> i guess jar-checksums shouldn't be run on windows.  A whole
                  bunch of checksums appear to have had their line endings
                  changed.
13:02 <@elyograg> I expected only one checksum to change.
13:04 <@hoss> elyograg: that's odd ... i thought the checksum generating code
              was done by ant and didn't depend on native line endings ... i
              would definitely raise a jira
