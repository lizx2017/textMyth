Summary:
New FixedPostingsFormat for less overhead than SepPostingsFormat
Description:
I've worked out the start at a new postings format that should have
less overhead for fixed-int[] encoders (For,PFor)... using ideas from
the old bulk branch, and new ideas from Robert.
It's only a start: there's no payloads support yet, and I haven't run
Lucene's tests with it, except for one new test I added that tries to
be a thorough PostingsFormat tester (to make it easier to create new
postings formats). It does pass luceneutil's performance test, so
it's at least able to run those queries correctly...
Like Lucene40, it uses two files (though once we add payloads it may
be 3). The .doc file interleaves doc delta and freq blocks, and .pos
has position delta blocks. Unlike sep, blocks are NOT shared across
terms; instead, it uses block encoding if there are enough ints to
encode, else the same Lucene40 vInt format. This means low-freq terms
(< 128 = current default block size) are always vInts, and high-freq
terms will have some number of blocks, with a vInt final block.
Skip points are only recorded at block starts.
