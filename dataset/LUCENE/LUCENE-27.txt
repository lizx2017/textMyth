Summary:
Cannot search numeric values
Description:
Lucene seems like it cannot search for numeric values only alpha values. I
indexed a file named 777 and when I did a search on it it is not found. Also
add size value to the contents to be searched and no match is found. Seems
like you cannot search numeric values.
