Summary:
MathUtil is publiuc and checks parameter only with assert. Incorrect usage can easily lead to endless loop
Description:
We should check the 2 parameters carefully before entering the loop. Those checks here cost nothing.
Otherwise this class must be hidden, we should not offer any public method to the users that can loop infinite without parameter checking.
