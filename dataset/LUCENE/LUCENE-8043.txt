Summary:
Attempting to add documents past limit can corrupt index
Description:
The IndexWriter check for too many documents does not always work, resulting in going over the limit. Once this happens, Lucene refuses to open the index and throws a CorruptIndexException: Too many documents.
This appears to affect all versions of Lucene/Solr (the check was first implemented in LUCENE-5843 in v4.9.1/4.10 and we've seen this manifest in 4.10)
