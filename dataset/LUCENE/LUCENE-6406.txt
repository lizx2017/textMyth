Summary:
LuceneTestCase does not reset the original query cache
Description:
LuceneTestCase overrides the default query cache so that every test runs with its own cache and is reproducible. But it does not reset the query cache when it is finished. As a consequence, any other suite running in the same runner and not inheriting LuceneTestCase will inherit a "dirty" query cache.
