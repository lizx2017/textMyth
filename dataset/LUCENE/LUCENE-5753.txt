Summary:
Refresh UAX29URLEmailTokenizer's TLD list
Description:
uax_url_email analyzer appears unable to recognize the ".local" TLD among others. Bug can be reproduced by
curl -XGET "ADDRESS/INDEX/_analyze?text=First%20Last%20lname@section.mycorp.local&pretty&analyzer=uax_url_email"
will parse "lname@section.my" and "corp.local" as separate tokens, as opposed to
curl -XGET "ADDRESS/INDEX/_analyze?text=First%20Last%20lname@section.mycorp.org&pretty&analyzer=uax_url_email"
which will recognize "lname@section.mycorp.org".
Can this be fixed by updating to a newer version? I am running ElasticSearch 0.90.5 and whatever Lucene version sits underneath that. My suspicion is that the TLD list the analyzer relies on (http://www.internic.net/zones/root.zone, I think?) is incomplete and needs updating.
