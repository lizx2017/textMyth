Summary:
logic error in QueryParser and in BooleanQuery !
Description:
I think there's "ideo-logic" error in QueryParser:
(and in BooleanQuery!)
when I search for smth. like "love OR NOT onion"
I receive the same result as I search for "love AND NOT onion".
IMHO it's wrong.
Let we have 4 docs:
doc1: "Love is life"
doc2: "Java is pretty nice language"
doc3: "C++ is powerful, but unsafe"
doc4: "Onion and love sometimes are not compatoble"
So, if search for "love OR NOT onion"
result must be: doc1, doc2, doc3.
(everything where the word "onion" isn't present, because we say "OR")
but, we have the same result as in case of search for:
"love AND NOT onion":
result: doc1.
So, I have created own parser, using BooleanQuery, that would help
me, but unfortunatelly it wouldn't.
Please ! Fix it ASAYK !
