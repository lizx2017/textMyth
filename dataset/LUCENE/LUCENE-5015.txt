Summary:
Unexpected performance difference between SamplingAccumulator and StandardFacetAccumulator
Description:
I have an unexpected performance difference between the SamplingAccumulator and the StandardFacetAccumulator.
The case is an index with about 5M documents and each document containing about 10 fields. I created a facet on each of those fields. When searching to retrieve facet-counts (using 1 CountFacetRequest), the SamplingAccumulator is about twice as fast as the StandardFacetAccumulator. This is expected and a nice speed-up.
However, when I use more CountFacetRequests to retrieve facet-counts for more than one field, the speeds of the SampingAccumulator decreases, to the point where the StandardFacetAccumulator is faster.
 
FacetRequests  Sampling    Standard
 1               391 ms     1100 ms
 2               531 ms     1095 ms 
 3               948 ms     1108 ms
 4              1400 ms     1110 ms
 5              1901 ms     1102 ms
Is this behaviour normal? I did not expect it, as the SamplingAccumulator needs to do less work?
Some code to show what I do:
 searcher.search( facetsQuery, facetsCollector );
 final List<FacetResult> collectedFacets = facetsCollector.getFacetResults();
final FacetSearchParams facetSearchParams = new FacetSearchParams( facetRequests );

FacetsCollector facetsCollector;

if ( isSampled )
{
 facetsCollector =
  FacetsCollector.create( new SamplingAccumulator( new RandomSampler(), facetSearchParams, searcher.getIndexReader(), taxo ) );
}
else
{
 facetsCollector = FacetsCollector.create( FacetsAccumulator.create( facetSearchParams, searcher.getIndexReader(), taxo ) );
