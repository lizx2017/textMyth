Summary:
IndexOrDocValuesQuery not working with LRUQueryCache (?)
Description:
I was experimenting with 6.5.0-SNAPSHOT and could not see any performance improvement using the new IndexOrDocValuesQuery where I would have expected some.
I am using a basic FILTER query (term + point/dv range), along with IndexSearcher#search.
Looking at the stack trace it seems that LRUQueryCache#CachingWrapperWeight not delegating the scorerSupplier method is the reason.
Maybe it is on purpose for the result to be cacheable ? Does that mean IndexOrDocValuesQuery is not useable with the default IndexSearcher cache ? (Or maybe am I just completely misusing the IndexOrDocValuesQuery feature ?)
Here is a thread dump of the call to IndexOrDocValuesQuery#scorerSupplier
