Summary:
Intersects for GeoExactCircle does not trigger in some cases
Description:
Hi Karl Wright,
It seems there is another issue with exact circles that shows up in the tests. It seems that in some cases the method insertsects() do not provide the right results so the relationship is wrongly computed. I attach a test showing the issue in a moment.
Cheers!
