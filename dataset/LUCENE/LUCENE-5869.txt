Summary:
FuzzyQuery should require positive maxExpansions
Description:
FuzzyQuery currently only disallows negative values of maxExpansions. However, passing 0 causes an NPE when the underlying TopTermsRewrite does a peek() on an empty queue, which returns null, and then goes on using it unknowingly.
