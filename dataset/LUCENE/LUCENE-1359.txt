Summary:
FrenchAnalyzer's tokenStream method does not honour the contract of Analyzer
Description:
In Analyzer :
/** Creates a TokenStream which tokenizes all the text in the provided
    Reader.  Default implementation forwards to tokenStream(Reader) for 
    compatibility with older version.  Override to allow Analyzer to choose 
    strategy based on document and/or field.  Must be able to handle null
    field name for backward compatibility. */
  public abstract TokenStream tokenStream(String fieldName, Reader reader);
and in FrenchAnalyzer
public final TokenStream tokenStream(String fieldName, Reader reader) {

    if (fieldName == null) throw new IllegalArgumentException("fieldName must not be null");
    if (reader == null) throw new IllegalArgumentException("reader must not be null");
