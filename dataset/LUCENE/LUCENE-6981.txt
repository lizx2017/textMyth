Summary:
SpanQuery.getTermContexts() static helper methods should be public
Description:
Currently, SpanQuery has two protected static helper methods for extracting all TermContext objects from a collection of SpanWeights. These are useful for objects extending SpanQuery. However, because they're static protected, they can't be accessed by subclasses if those subclasses have been loaded by a different classloader (for example, if they're being loaded as a Solr plugin).
