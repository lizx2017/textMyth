Summary:
GeoPointDistanceQuery doesn't work with a large radius?
Description:
I'm working on LUCENE-6698 but struggling with test failures ...
Then I noticed that TestGeoPointQuery's test never tests on large distances, so I modified the test to sometimes do so (like TestBKDTree) and hit test failures.
