Summary:
Too many open files
Description:
We have been using Lucene 3.1 version with Tomcat 4.0 and jdk1.4.
It seems that sometimes we see a "Too many files open" exception which
completely garbles the whole index and whole search functionality crashes on
the web site. It has also been known to crash the complete JSP container of
tomcat.
After looking at the bug list, we found out that it has been reported as a bug
in the Lucene bug list as Bug#29774, #30049, #30452 which claims to have been
resolved with the new version of Lucene.
We have tried everything to reproduce the problem ourselves to figure out the
exact circumstances under which it occurs but with out any luck.
We would be installing the new version of Lucene but we need to be able to
reproduce the problem to test it.
We would really appreciate it if someone could point us to the root cause
behind this so we can devise a solution around that.
