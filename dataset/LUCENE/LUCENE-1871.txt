Summary:
Highlighter wraps caching token filters that are not CachingTokenFilter in CachingTokenFilter
Description:
I figured this was fine and a rare case that you would have another caching tokenstream to feed the highlighter with - but I guess if its happening to you, especially depending on what you are doing - its not an ideal situation.
