Summary:
ComplexPhraseQuery.rewrite throws "Unknown query type:org.apache.lucene.search.SynonymQuery" when nested BooleanQuery contains a SynonymQuery
Description:
When using nested queries in ComplexPhrases, and a part of the query is a SynonymQuery, an exception is thrown from  addComplexPhraseClause:
throw new IllegalArgumentException("Unknown query type:"
{{ + childQuery.getClass().getName());}}
Examples (dogs and tv are synonyms):
"(cats OR dogs) cigar"
"platform* (video* OR tv)"~10
The bug is similar in nature to LUCENE-8305, in that SynonymQuery support was added to ComplexPhraseQueryParser (in LUCENE-7695), but was not expanded to nested queries.
The fix is similar to the one in LUCENE-8305, namely to add the same logic in addComplexPhraseClause as in rewrite.
See attached patch.
