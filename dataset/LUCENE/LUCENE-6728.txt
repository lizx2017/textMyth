Summary:
Add clean as a dependency on precommit
Description:
I think that precommit should depend on clean. On branch_5x, I started a precommit, then realized partway through that I was running with Java 8. I interrupted the precommit, changed JAVA_HOME to point at Java 7, and started it again. After a few minutes, the forbidden-api check failed because it couldn't find a class.
Is there any situation where a clean should NOT be done before starting precommit?
