Summary:
Generate backwards compatibility indexes for all 4.x releases
Description:
Currently the versioning here is a total mess, and its inconsistent across bugfix releases.
We should just generate back compat indexes for every release: regardless of whether the index format changed, even for bugfix releases. This ensures at least we try to test that the back compat is working.
