Summary:
hunspell zero-affix handling doesn't work with continuation classes
Description:
We fixed handling for this in LUCENE-5817, for the simple case:
SFX 322 eer 0 .
But its broken in the case the zero affix has continuation flags:
SFX 322 eer 0/100 .
Because we look for "0" before we parse those away...
