Summary:
BinaryDictionary may fail reading a file
Description:
The following code may fail on other JVMs, e.g. on Android:
final ByteBuffer tmpBuffer = ByteBuffer.allocateDirect(size);
final ReadableByteChannel channel = Channels.newChannel(dictIS);
final int read = channel.read(tmpBuffer);
if (read != size)
{ throw new EOFException("Cannot read whole dictionary"); }
The code expects that channel.read() will fill entire buffer contents, which is however not the case: ReadableByteChannel.read() may even decide to read 0 bytes and this mimicks InputStream.read() behavior. The current Lucene code accidentally works on Oracle Java because Oracle Java channel.read() fills the buffer fully (just check the Channels.newChannel() implementation).
