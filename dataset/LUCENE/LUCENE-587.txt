Summary:
Explanation.toHtml outputs invalid HTML
Description:
If you want an HTML representation of an Explanation, you might call the toHtml() method. However, the output of this method looks like the following:
<ul>
<li>some value = some description</li>
<ul>
<li>some nested value = some description</li>
</ul>
</ul>
As it is illegal in HTML to nest a UL directly inside a UL, this method will always output unparseable HTML if there are nested explanations.
What Lucene probably means to output is the following, which is valid HTML:
<ul>
<li>some value = some description
<ul>
<li>some nested value = some description</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
