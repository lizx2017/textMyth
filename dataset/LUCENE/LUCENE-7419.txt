Summary:
performance bug in tokenstream.end()
Description:
TokenStream.end() calls getAttribute(), which is pretty costly to do per-stream.
It does its current hack, because in the ctor of TokenStream is "too early".
Instead, we can just add a variant of clear(), called end() to AttributeImpl. For most attributes it defers to clear, but for PosIncAtt it can handle the special case.
