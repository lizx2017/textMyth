Summary:
wrong exception from NativeFSLockFactory (LIA2 test case)
Description:
As part of integrating Lucene In Action 2 test cases (LUCENE-2661), I found one of the test cases fail
the test is pretty simple, and passes on 3.0. The exception you get instead (LockReleaseFailedException) is
pretty confusing and I think we should fix it.
