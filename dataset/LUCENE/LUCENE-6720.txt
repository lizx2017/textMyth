Summary:
new FunctionRangeQuery, plus ValueSourceScorer improvements
Description:
This issue provides a new FunctionRangeQuery, which is basically a wrapper around ValueSourceScorer (retrieved from FunctionValues.getRangeScorer). It replaces ValueSourceFilter in the spatial module. Solr has a class by the same name which is similar but isn't suitable to being ported.
Also, it includes refactorings to the ValueSourceScorer, to include performance enhancements by making it work with the TwoPhaseIterator API.
note: I posted this to LUCENE-4251 initially but then felt it's really its own issue.
