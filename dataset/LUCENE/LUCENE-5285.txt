Summary:
FastVectorHighlighter copies segments scores when splitting segments across multi-valued fields
Description:
FastVectorHighlighter copies segments scores when splitting segments across multi-valued fields. This is only a problem when you want to sort the fragments by score. Technically BaseFragmentsBuilder (line 261 in my copy of the source) does the copying.
Rather than copying the score I think it'd be more right to pull that copying logic into a protected method that child classes (such as ScoreOrderFragmentsBuilder) can override to do more intelligent things. Exactly what that means isn't clear to me at the moment.
