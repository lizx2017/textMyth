Summary:
4.4 RC0 can not read indexes created with 4.2.1 using Disk based docvals
Description:
On the #solr irc channel, user adityab reported a problem trying to upgrade an existing solr instance from 4.2.1 to the 4.4 RC0 code. The specific error he reported was a "CorruptIndexException: invalid type: 65" from DiskDocValuesProducer.readFields using an MMapIndexInput. While waiting for more details from adityab on reproducible configs, i attempted to do a trivial test using simple solr configs based on the docvals test configs, and was able to trigger a slightly different error in which DiskDocValuesProducer.readFields caused an EOFException.
The problem reproduces on both solr init, and when using CheckIndex â€“ details to reproduce to follow in an attachment/comment
