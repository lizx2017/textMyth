Summary:
[PATCH] cleaner API for Field.Text
Description:
Currently there are four methods named Field.Text(). As those methods have
the same name and a very similar method signature, everyone will think these
are just convenience methods that do the same thing. But they behave
differently: the one that takes a Reader doesn't store the data, the one that
takes a String does. I know that this is documented, but it's still not a nice
API. Methods that behave differently should have diffent names. The attached
patch deprecates two of the old methods and adds two new ones named
Field.StoredText(). I think this is much easier to understand from the
programmer's point-of-view and will help avoid bugs.
