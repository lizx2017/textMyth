Summary:
Weird BooleanQuery behavior
Description:
Here's a simple OR-connected query.
T:files T:deleting C:thanks C:exists
The query above hits 1 document. But following same query only
with parenthesis results nothing.
(T:files T:deleting) (C:thanks C:exists)
Another combinations of MUST and SHOULD.
"T:files T:deleting +C:production +C:optimize" hits 1 document.
"(T:files T:deleting) (+C:production +C:optimize)" hits 1 document.
