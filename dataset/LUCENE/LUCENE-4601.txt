Summary:
ivy availability check isn't quite right
Description:
remove ivy from your .ant/lib but load it up on a build file like so:
You have to lie to lucene's build, overriding ivy.available, because for some reason the detection is wrong and will tell you ivy is not available, when it actually is.
I tried changing the detector to use available classname=some.ivy.class and this didnt work either... so I don't actually know what the correct fix is.
<project name="test" default="test" basedir=".">

  <path id="ivy.lib.path">
    <fileset dir="/Users/rmuir" includes="ivy-2.2.0.jar" />
  </path>
  <taskdef resource="org/apache/ivy/ant/antlib.xml" uri="antlib:org.apache.ivy.ant" classpathref="ivy.lib.path" />

  <target name="test">
    <subant target="test" inheritAll="false" inheritRefs="false" failonerror="true">
      <fileset dir="lucene-trunk/lucene" includes="build.xml"/>
      <!-- lie -->
      <property name="ivy.available" value="true"/>
    </subant>
  </target>
