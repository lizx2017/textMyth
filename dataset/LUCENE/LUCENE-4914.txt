Summary:
Spatial PrefixTree Node/Cell reset() doesn't reset 'leaf' flag
Description:
The SpatialPrefixTree Cell (formerly known as "Node") was refactored in LUCENE-4794 which made it into Lucene 4.2. It introduced an explicit internal "leaf" flag that was formerly computed by examining shapeRel. However, reset() doesn't reset this new flag.
The bug affects SpatialRecursivePrefixTreeStrategy on non-point indexed shapes.
