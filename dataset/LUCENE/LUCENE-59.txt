Summary:
IndexReader.unlock() won't clear commit.lock if write.lock not present
Description:
IndexReader.unlock() calls Directory.deleteFile() for write.lock and
commit.lock in succession, presumably to clear both locks. However, if
write.lock doesn't exist, FSDirectory will throw an IOException, preventing the
second deletefile from getting called and potentially leaving the commit.lock.
public static void unlock(Directory directory) throws IOException {
directory.deleteFile("write.lock");
directory.deleteFile("commit.lock");
Added note:
Since IndexReader.isLocked() only checks for the write.lock, there's no way
programmatically to assure that the commit.lock is not set without breaking the
API abstraction and looking for it in the Directory object by name.
