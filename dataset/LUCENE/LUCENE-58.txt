Summary:
Date fields should not be tokenized.
Description:
the helper factory method in org.apache.lucene.document.Field :
public static final Field Keyword(String name, Date value)
specifies the field to be tokenized, which I don't think is correct...
the TestDateFilter testcase manually creates the field so the bug is not
caught by testcases
