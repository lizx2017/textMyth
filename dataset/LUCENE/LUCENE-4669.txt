Summary:
Document wrongly deleted from index
Description:
I'm trying to implement document deletion from an index.
If I create an index with three documents (A, B and C) and then try to delete A, A gets marked as deleted but C is removed from the index. I've tried this with different number of documents and saw that it is always the last document that is removed.
When I run the example unit test code bellow I get this output:
Before delete
Found 3 documents
Document at = 0; isDeleted = false; path = a; 
Document at = 1; isDeleted = false; path = b; 
Document at = 2; isDeleted = false; path = c; 
After delete
Found 2 documents
Document at = 0; isDeleted = true; path = a; 
Document at = 1; isDeleted = false; path = b; 
Example unit test:
ExampleUnitTest.java
    @Test
    public void delete() throws Exception {
        File indexDir = FileUtils.createTempDir();

        IndexWriter writer = new IndexWriter(new NIOFSDirectory(indexDir), new IndexWriterConfig(Version.LUCENE_40,
            new StandardAnalyzer(Version.LUCENE_40)));
        Document doc = new Document();
        String fieldName = "path";
        doc.add(new StringField(fieldName, "a", Store.YES));
        writer.addDocument(doc);
        doc = new Document();
        doc.add(new StringField(fieldName, "b", Store.YES));
        writer.addDocument(doc);
        doc = new Document();
        doc.add(new StringField(fieldName, "c", Store.YES));
        writer.addDocument(doc);
        writer.commit();

        System.out.println("Before delete");
        print(indexDir);

        writer.deleteDocuments(new Term(fieldName, "a"));
        writer.commit();

        System.out.println("After delete");
        print(indexDir);

    }

    public static void print(File indexDirectory) throws IOException {
        DirectoryReader reader = DirectoryReader.open(new NIOFSDirectory(indexDirectory));
        Bits liveDocs = MultiFields.getLiveDocs(reader);
        int numDocs = reader.numDocs();
        System.out.println("Found " + numDocs + " documents");
        for (int i = 0; i < numDocs; i++) {
            Document document = reader.document(i);
            StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();
            sb.append("Document at = ").append(i);
            sb.append("; isDeleted = ").append(liveDocs != null ? !liveDocs.get(i) : false).append("; ");
            for (IndexableField field : document.getFields()) {
                String fieldName = field.name();
                for (String value : document.getValues(fieldName)) {
                    sb.append(fieldName).append(" = ").append(value).append("; ");
                }
            }
            System.out.println(sb.toString());
        }
    }
