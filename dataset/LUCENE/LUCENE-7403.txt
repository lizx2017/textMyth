Summary:
Don't artificially lower the leaf block size of points in the 1D case
Description:
Points currently put 0.75*maxPointsInLeafNode values in the leaf nodes, as an attempt to have as many values as multi-dimensional points on average. However, I don't think this is necessary, especially since 1D points are now written the same way at flush and write time (from a sorted iterator).
