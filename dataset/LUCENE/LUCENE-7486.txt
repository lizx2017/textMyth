Summary:
DisjunctionMaxScorer Initializes scoreMax to Zero Preventing From Using Negative Scores
Description:
We are using a log of probability for scoring, which gives us negative scores.
DisjunctionMaxScorer initializes scoreMax in the score(...) function to zero preventing us from using negative scores. Is there a reason it couldn't be initialized to something like this:
float scoreMax = Float.MAX_VALUE * -1;
