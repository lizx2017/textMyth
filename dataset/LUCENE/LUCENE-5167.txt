Summary:
SimilarityBase does not pass docId in the score method for use of FieldCache or DocValues
Description:
SimilarityBase does not pass docId in the score method for use of FieldCache or DocValues.
If the intent of extending SimilarityBase is to use a FieldCache or NumericDocValuesField as part of the scoring, this is not possible because SimilarityBase does not pass on the docId as one of the parameters of the score method. This parameter should be added to the score method so that fieldCache or NumericDocValues can be used when extending SimilarityBase.
