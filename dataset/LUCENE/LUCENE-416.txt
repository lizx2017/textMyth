Summary:
Lucene leaves lock files with NFS
Description:
I run a web-application on a system (the system where I upload and edit the
web-app) that is shared through NFS on another system (the actual server).
The directory where Lucene places its files is one of the places that are shared
through NFS.
It turns out that something in Lucene causes the NFS system to make 'temporary'
files (.nfs* files), which can't be removed (and which take quite some time to
go). This doesn't give problems in most operations (since I generally use
incremental indexing to update the index), but when I try to create a full index
these files prevent the directory from being deleted.
Apparently lucene keeps a file open that has already been deleted in another
thread. Perhaps this occurs during incremental indexing?
