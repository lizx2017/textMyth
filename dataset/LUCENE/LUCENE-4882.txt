Summary:
FacetsAccumulator.java:185 throws NullPointerException if it's given an empty CategoryPath.
Description:
When I wanted to count root categories, I used to pass "new CategoryPath(new String[0])" to a CountFacetRequest.
Since upgrading lucene from 4.1 to 4.2, that threw ArrayIndexOfOutBoundsException, so I passed CategoryPath.EMPTY to a CountFacetRequest instead, and this time I got NullPointerException.
It all originates from FacetsAccumulator.java:185
Does someone conspire to prevent others from counting root categories?
