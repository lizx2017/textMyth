Summary:
Inconsistent org.apache.lucene.codecs.PostingsFormat service definition?
Description:
I have a doubt about a seeming inconsistency w.r.t. to a service definition in the distribution JAR files:
  "lucene-suggest-7.2.1.jar" contains "org.apache.lucene.search.suggest.document.Completion50PostingsFormat" under "/META-INF/services/org.apache.lucene.codecs.PostingsFormat" (and BTW two copies of the license in that file?).
  "lucene-core-7.2.1.jar" contains "org.apache.lucene.codecs.lucene50.Lucene50PostingsFormat" under "/META-INF/services/org.apache.lucene.codecs.PostingsFormat"
  Apparently, it depends on the classpath order on the client side which implementation is used. Is it intentional that there are two unequal definitions in the same release?
  Note: I've observed this because of some Jar Hell checker output, not because there's an actual malfunction that I'm aware of.
