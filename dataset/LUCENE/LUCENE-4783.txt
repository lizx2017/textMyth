Summary:
Inconsistent results, changing based on recent previous searches (caching?)
Description:
We have several repeatable cases where Lucene is returning different candidates for the same search, on the same (static) index, depending on what other searches have been run before hand.
It appears as though Lucene is failing to find matches in some cases if they have not been cached by a previous search.
In specific (although it is happening with more than just fuzzy searches), a fuzzy search on a misspelled street name returns no result. If you then search on the correctly spelled street name, and THEN return to the original fuzzy query on the original incorrect spelling, you now receive the result.
