Summary:
BKDReader could compress values better
Description:
For compressing values, BKDReader only relies on shared prefixes in a block. We could probably easily do better. For instance there are only 256 possible values for the first byte of the dimension that the values are sorted by, yet we use a block size of 1024. So by using something simple like run-length compression we could save 6 bits per value on average.
