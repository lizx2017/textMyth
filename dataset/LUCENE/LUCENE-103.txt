Summary:
QueryParser fails on querys using "AND" and stopwords
Description:
The queries (1) "+this +tree" and (2) "this AND tree" should both be parsed to
the same query-object.
the following code-snippet shows a bug in QueryParser.
Query (1) is correctly parsed. Parsing Query (2) results in an
IndexOutOfBoundsException.
It seems that the Parser first removes the stop-word "this", resulting in the
query "AND tree" and then fails to parse this query. Replacing "this" by a
non-stopWord produces no errors.
try {
StandardAnalyzer tAnalyzer = new StandardAnalyzer();
Query tQuery1 = QueryParser.parse("+this +tree", "content", tAnalyzer);
System.out.println(tQuery1.toString("content"));
Query tQuery2 = QueryParser.parse("this AND tree", "content", tAnalyzer);
//never reached!
System.out.println(tQuery2.toString("content"));
} catch ( Exception e ) {
e.printStackTrace();
}
