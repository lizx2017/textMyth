Summary:
Absurdly large radius (miles) search fails to include entire earth
Description:
Spinoff from LUCENE-1781.
If you do a very large (eg 100000 miles) radius search then the
lat/lng bound box wraps around the entire earth and all points should
be accepted. But this fails today (many points are rejected). It's
easy to see the issue: edit TestCartesian, and insert a very large
miles into either testRange or testGeoHashRange.
