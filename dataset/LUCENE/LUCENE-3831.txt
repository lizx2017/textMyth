Summary:
Passing a null fieldname to MemoryFields#terms in MemoryIndex throws a NPE
Description:
I found this when querying a MemoryIndex using a RegexpQuery wrapped by a SpanMultiTermQueryWrapper. If the regexp doesn't match anything in the index, it gets rewritten to an empty SpanOrQuery with a null field value, which then triggers the NPE.
