Summary:
current ecj-javadoc-lint crashes on SharedFSAutoReplicaFailoverUtilsTest / update build to work with Java 9
Description:
It seems the version we are using has bugs that are tripped by this test.
We are using 3.7.2, I think we should upgrade to 4.4?
It seems to solve the issue for me.
We should also update our build files to make ecj also be executed on Java 8, but not on Java 9.
So we need to add checks for Java 9.
