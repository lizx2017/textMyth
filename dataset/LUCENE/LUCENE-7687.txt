Summary:
ComplexPhraseQueryParser with AsciiFoldingFilterFactory (SOLR)
Description:
I modified generic *_txt-Field type to use AsciiFoldingFilterFactory on query & index.
When quering with
{!complexphrase}text_txt:"König*" – there are 0 results
{!complexphrase}text_txt:"Konig*" – there are >0 results
{!complexphrase}text_txt:"König" – there are >0 results (but less than the line above)
and without {!complexphrase} everything works o.k.
