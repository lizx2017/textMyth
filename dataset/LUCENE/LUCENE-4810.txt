Summary:
Positions are incremented for each ngram in EdgeNGramTokenFilter
Description:
Edge ngrams should be like synonyms, with all the ngrams generated from a token having the same position as that original token. The current code increments position.
For the text "molecular biology", the query "mol bio" should match as a phrase in neighboring positions. It does not.
You can see this in the Analysis page in the admin UI.
