Summary:
TestLRUQueryCache.testDetectMutatedQueries does not work on Java 9 b150
Description:
For some strange reason, the test testDetectMutatedQueries of TestLRUQueryCache suite does not trigger the ConcurrentModificationException on changing the hashCode (see BadQuery class).
I have no idea why this happens, so I will disable this test on Java 9 for now.
The other test also fails with Java 9 because of RamUsageTester (LUCENE-7595), but this is unrelated, so I opened a separate issue.
