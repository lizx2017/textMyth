Summary:
Pull change id related code out of addVersion.py, since it's no longer used
Description:
LUCENE-6938 led to the remove of code that merges the downstream changes for addition of a new version. That seems like an accidental removal and we should add it back with a few changes so that it now uses git instead of svn.
