Summary:
GeoComplexPolygon throws error when checking within() for a point parallel to test point
Description:
If a GeoComplexPolygon is created with test point (x, y, z) and we try to check if point(-x,-y,-z) is {{within()}}then an error is thrown. It seems we need to handle the case when a point is parallel to the test point but not identical.
