Summary:
Remove equals/rewrite hacks from block join queries
Description:
These queries try to ensure that rewritten queries are equal to the original query by keeping around the original query that was used to instantiate the join query. However this does not buy anything, and could even prevent two queries that rewrite to the same form to be considered equals.
