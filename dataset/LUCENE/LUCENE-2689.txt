Summary:
remove NativeFSLockFactory's attempt to acquire a test lock
Description:
NativeFSLockFactory tries to acquire a test lock the first time a lock is created. It's the only LF to do this, and, it's caused us hassle (LUCENE-2421, LUCENE-2688).
I think we should just remove it. The caller of .makeLock will presumably immediately thereafter acquire the lock and at the point hit any exception that acquireTestLock would've hit.
