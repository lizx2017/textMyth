Summary:
HandleTrackingFs leaks files if #onClose throws an exception
Description:
if #onClose throws an exception for instance due to an error in #onOpen we leak the filehandle since we don't call super.close(). I ran into this in Elasticsearch tests where files are concurrently deleted and we got a WindowsFS -> LeakFS -> UnixFs. The UnixFS opened the file but by the time WindowsFS tried to read the files metadata it was already deleted causing onOpen to barf and we leaked the file.
