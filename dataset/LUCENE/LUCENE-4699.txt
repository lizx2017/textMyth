Summary:
AssertionError triggered in IndexWriter.filesExist
Description:
Occasionally I get this AssertionError in my unit tests:
java.lang.AssertionError: file _0_Lucene40_0.tim does not exist
at org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter.filesExist(IndexWriter.java:3981)
at org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter.startCommit(IndexWriter.java:4047)
at org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter.prepareCommit(IndexWriter.java:2800)
at org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter.commitInternal(IndexWriter.java:2875)
at org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter.commit(IndexWriter.java:2855)
at org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter.commit(IndexWriter.java:2839)
I'm not sure what's supposed to trigger this. To fix this I just rerun my tests and the error is gone.
I believe it's probably caused by something I'm doing wrong, but I was hoping to get some kind of declared exception and not an assertion error.
