Summary:
toString of TermRangeQuery ends with "}" instead of "]"
Description:
Create a TermRangeQuery, then toString it, you'll get something like this:
+lastmodified:[19700101000000 TO 20130228202438}
The last character is wrong. I came across this when I tried to parse a query based on the toString of a TermRangeQuery.
