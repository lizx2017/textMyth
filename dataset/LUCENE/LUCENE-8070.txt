Summary:
GeoExactCircle should not create circles that they do not fit in spheroid
Description:
Hi Karl Wright,
I have seen test fail when we try to create circles that the don' t fit in the planet. I think sectors of the circle start overlapping to each other and the shape becomes invalid. The shape should prevent that to happen.
I will attach a test and a proposed solution.
