Summary:
it is impossible to use a custom dictionary for SmartChineseAnalyzer
Description:
it is not possible to use a custom dictionary, even though there is a lot of code and javadocs to allow this.
This is because the custom dictionary is only loaded if it cannot load the built-in one (which is of course, in the jar file and should load)
public synchronized static WordDictionary getInstance() {
    if (singleInstance == null) {
      singleInstance = new WordDictionary(); // load from jar file
      try {
        singleInstance.load();
      } catch (IOException e) { // loading from jar file must fail before it checks the AnalyzerProfile (where this can be configured)
        String wordDictRoot = AnalyzerProfile.ANALYSIS_DATA_DIR;
        singleInstance.load(wordDictRoot);
      } catch (ClassNotFoundException e) {
        throw new RuntimeException(e);
      }
    }
    return singleInstance;
  }
I think we should either correct this, document this, or disable custom dictionary support...
