Summary:
FloatDocValues does not return true for 0 >< 1 values
Description:
The following function query should always yield 1 if the document's field matchers the query:
if(query({!lucene df=FIELD v=$q},0),1,0)
This is, however, not true if due to low IDF the score end up below 1 but, obviously, above 0. The if() statement does not recognize a number between zero and one as positive and therefore TRUE.
