Summary:
'ant get-maven-poms' should support custom version formats
Description:
LUCENE-5217 changed the way ant get-maven-poms works, so that dependencies are pulled from the Ant build, instead of being hard-coded in the POM templates. To parse the versions from internal module dependencies, the new internal Ant task GetMavenDependenciesTask uses a regex that expects a dotted/slashed/underscored numeric + optional -SNAPSHOT version format. As a result, non-conforming versions trigger a build failure - see the lucene-dev mailing list thread "maven build issues with non-numeric custom version": <http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/lucene-dev/201401.mbox/%3cCAF=Pa5-0sXE9Su1PgF5M+F0T+g3Q=fetWgXDh5Ry1ab3ZRhquQ@mail.gmail.com%3e>
This is a regression, since previously, custom version strings worked properly, e.g. ant -Dversion=my-custom-version get-maven-poms.
