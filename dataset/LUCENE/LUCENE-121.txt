Summary:
QueryParser does not handle the Stemmer very well
Description:
When I use an Anaylizer with the PorterStemFilter for indexing
and the same Anaylizer for searching, I am unable to find stemmed words.
Example: I have a document with the word "running" or the
word "values". I think it is getting indexed correctly ( "ing" and "es"
being removed), however when I enter the same word in the search "values",
for example, it is not found. But, if I then enter "valu" as a search
parameter, it is found. So, I am guessing that the stemming is not
being done by the QueryParser. Also, I have the same problem with the
GermanStemFilter as well.
