Summary:
Make the core Accountables.namedAccountable function public
Description:
Accountables has a number of methods named namedAccountable. The core one of these works by taking a snapshot with an anonymous Accountable. This method is currently private due to concerns over safety. However, I think we should make it public, and document the how safety can be achieved (which is by only using that and the other namedAccountable methods).
