Summary:
tests relying on empty stderr
Description:
Some of the tests are relying on empty stder.
This is very inconvenient for machines using various configurations on various JVMs.
Eg:
JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS='-XX:+UseShenandoahGC '
export JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS
then any jvm invocation (even java -version) prints to stderr
/usr/bin/java -version
Picked up JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS: -XX:+UseShenandoahGC
There are much more cases when stderr is used for smilar informatio, and lucene testsuite should be readdy for this.
Maybe for start just remove all lines staring by "Picked up" for openjdk?-)
