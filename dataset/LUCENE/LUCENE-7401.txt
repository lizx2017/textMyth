Summary:
BKDWriter should ensure all dimensions are indexed
Description:
The current heuristic is to use the dimension that has the largest span, so if dimensions have a different distribution of values, we could theoretically (but maybe in practice too?) end up with one dimension that is not indexed at all and queries that are mostly selective on this dimension would need to scan lots of blocks.
