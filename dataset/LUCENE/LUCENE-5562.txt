Summary:
LuceneSuggester does not work on Android
Description:
I'm developing an application on android and I'm using lucene for indexing and searching. When I try to use AnalyzingSuggester (even the Fuzzy version) I got an Exception the BufferedOutputStream is already closed.
I tracked the problem and it seems that in
org.apache.lucene.search.suggest.Sort
and in org.apache.lucene.search.suggest.analyzing.AnalyzingSuggester
the outputstream is closed twice hence the exception on android.
The same code on windows runs without a problem.
It seems that the Android jvm does some additional checks. I attach two patche files, the classes close the output stream once. (check for writerClosed in the code to see what I did)
