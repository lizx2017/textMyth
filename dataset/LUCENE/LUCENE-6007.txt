There was a javadoc file for javax:activation:1.1-rev-1, but none for javax:activation:1.1.1, which might be the cause.
A work arround for people who encounter this problem specifically with javadoc jar files in older versions of lucene/solr is to create an empty fake file to satisfy the dependency checker at the "shared" path. In the above error, the expected shared path is C:\Users\Ilia\.ivy2\shared\javax.activation\activation\1.1.1\javadocs\activation.jar so create an empty file at that path.
