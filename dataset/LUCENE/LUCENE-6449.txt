Summary:
NullPointerException in PostingsHighlighter
Description:
In case an index segment does not have any docs with the field requested for highlighting indexed, there should be a null check immediately following this line (in PostingsHighlighter.java):
Terms t = r.terms(field);
Looks like the null check was moved in the 5.1 release and this is occasionally causing a NullPointerException in my near-realtime searcher.
