Summary:
Add small rounding to FuzzyQuery.floatToEdits
Description:
I realize that FuzzyQuery.floatToEdits is deprecated, but I'd like to make a small fix for posterity. Because of floating point issues, if a percentage leads to a number that is very close to a whole number of edits, our cast to int can improperly cause misses.
ddddd~0.8 will not match "ddddX"
eeeee~0.8 will not match "eeee" or "eeeeee"
This is a trivial part of the plan to reduce code duplication with LUCENE-5205.
