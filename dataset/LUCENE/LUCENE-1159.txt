Summary:
jarify target gives misleading message when svnversion doesn't exist
Description:
The jarify command in common-build.xml seems to indicate failure when it can't find svnversion, but this is, in fact, just a warning. We should check to see if svnversion exists before attempting the command at all, if possible.
The message looks something like:
[exec] Execute failed: java.io.IOException: java.io.IOException: svnversion: not found
Which is understandable, but it is not clear what the ramifications are of this missing.
