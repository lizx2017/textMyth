Summary:
No way to limit the fields cached in memory and leads to OOM when there are thousand of fields (thousands)
Description:
I am opening this defect to get some guidance on how to handle a case of server running out of memory and it seems like it's something to do how we index. But want to know if there is anyway to reduce the impact of this on memory usage before we look into the way of reducing the number of fields.
Basically we have many thousands of fields being indexed and it's causing a large amount of memory being used (25GB) and eventually leading to application to hang and force us to restart every few minutes.
