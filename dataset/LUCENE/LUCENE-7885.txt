Summary:
Inconsistent return of documents in TermsEnum.postings after unsuccesful TermsEnum.seekExact(bytes)
Description:
Depending on the number of segments, TermsEnum.seekExact(bytes) to find a non-existing term, followed by TermsEnum.postings() is inconsistently returning different results.
When optimized (to 1 segment in my test), the TermsEnum.postings() return the PostingsEnum with documents associated with the next entry in the terms list, if the term does not exist in the list.
If the core is not optimized, TermsEnum.postings() returns null.
In both cases, the TermsEnum.seekExact(bytes.toBytesRef()) and consecutive TermsEnum.term appears to have advanced to the next entry (relative to the non-existing term).
