Summary:
[PATCH] IOException: Cannot delete deletables
Description:
Hello
I encoutered a problem when i tried to index large document collections
(about 20 mio documents).
The indexing failed with the IOException:
"Cannot delete deletables"
I tried different times (with the same document collection) and allways
received the error, but after a different number
of documents.
The exception is thrown after failing to delete the specfied file at
line 212 in FSDirectory.java.
I found the following cure:
after the lines
if (nu.exists())
if (!nu.delete()){
i replaced
< throw new IOException("Cannot delete " + to);
with
> while(nu.exists()){
> nu.delete();
> System.out.println("delete loop");
> try
{ > Thread.sleep(5000); > }
catch (InterruptedException e)
{ > throw new RuntimeException(e); > }
That is, now i retry deleting the file until it is successful.
After the changes, i was able to index all documents.
From the fact that i observed several times
"delete loop"
on the output console, it can be deduced that the
body of the while loop was reached (and left) several times.
I am running lucene on windows xp.
