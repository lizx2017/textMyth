Summary:
scores not from 0 to 1, not consistant with HitCollector
Description:
I've noticed an oddity in scoring....
If I do my search like this:
searcher.search(query, filter, new HitCollector()
{
public void collect(int doc, float score)
{ tempHits.add(new LuceneHits(doc, score)); }
});
I get different scores for the resulting documents than I do if I do
my search like this:
hits = searcher.search(query, filter);
Both methods return the same number of hits. I can live with them
returning different scores, I'm just curious as to why it happens.
Furthermore, the first method returns several scores that are greater
than 1.0. Isn't this supposed to be impossible? The FAQ states that
scores range from 0 to 1.
I have a self-contained class test class I will attach shortly...
This affects the 1.3 RC's as well.
