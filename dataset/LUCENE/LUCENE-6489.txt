Summary:
Move span payloads to sandbox
Description:
As mentioned on LUCENE-6371:
I've marked the new classes and methods as lucene.experimental, rather than moving to the sandbox - if anyone feels strongly about that, maybe it could be done in a follow up issue.
I feel strongly about this and will do the move.
