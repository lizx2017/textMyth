Summary:
Remove multidimensional arrays from PointRangeQuery
Description:
This use of byte[][] has caused two bugs: LUCENE-7085 and LUCENE-7117.
It is not necessary, and causes code duplication in most Point classes because they have to have a pack() that encodes to byte[] for the indexer but a encode() or similar that makes multi-D byte[][] for just this query.
