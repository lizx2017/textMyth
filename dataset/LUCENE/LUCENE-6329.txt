Summary:
Calling score() should be ok even if needsScores is false
Description:
Currently if you use approximations on a disjunction scorer and call score() while needsScores was set to false, then you might run into exceptions.
The reason is that when scores are not needed then the scorer doesn't maintain the list of scorers positioned on the current doc ID and you can eg. end up with exhausted scorers in this list.
