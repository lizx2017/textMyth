Summary:
[PATCH] Parser bug when dealing with new lines.
Description:
Hi,
there seems to be a bug in the Lucene parser in the
treatment of spaces and newlines.
When we search for:
weltbank && identifier: weltbank
over a certain collection of texts, we get 82 hits.
If we write this as:
weltbank &&
identifier: weltbank
with no space after the &&, there still are 82 results. But
the same query with a space or tab after the && and before the newline
gives back 0 results!
Even worse, the same query with a space before the "identifier:", but
not after the &&:
weltbank &&
identifier: weltbank
gives 106 hits, i.e., the same as
weltbank || identifier: weltbank
Arrrgh!
There is a simple workaround - flattening the query string -
but this is probably only a problem of newlines not being treated
similar to whitespace in the parser code.
