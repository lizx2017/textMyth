Summary:
Error on reindex using WordNet synonyms file
Description:
Originally reported in the ES issues: https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/27798#issuecomment-351838983
but looks like the issue is introduced from the Lucene 7.0.X.
Copying the user's issue here:
------------------------------------------------------
I'm encountering the following error on indexing when trying to use the wn_s.pl synonyms file (which I've moved to /usr/local/etc/elasticsearch):
{
 "error": {
  "root_cause": [{
   "type": "illegal_argument_exception",
   "reason": "failed to build synonyms"
  }],
  "type": "illegal_argument_exception",
  "reason": "failed to build synonyms",
  "caused_by": {
   "type": "parse_exception",
   "reason": "Invalid synonym rule at line 2",
   "caused_by": {
    "type": "illegal_argument_exception",
    "reason": "term: physical entity analyzed to a token with posinc != 1"
   }
  }
 }
}
Here's the line it's objecting to:
s(100001930,1,'physical entity',n,1,0).
I'm using the WordNet Prolog synonyms file from http://wordnetcode.princeton.edu/3.0/WNprolog-3.0.tar.gz2
------------------------------------------------------
Looks like the error comes from Lucene's classes of WordnetSynonymParser and SynonymMap, and changes introduced from Lucene 7.0 version.
