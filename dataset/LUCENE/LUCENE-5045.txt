Summary:
DrillSideways.search yields IllegalArgEx if given IndexReader is empty
Description:
DrillSideways.create() creates either TopScoreDocCollector or TopFieldCollector with numHits = min(topN, reader.maxDoc()). When the reader is empty, these collectors throw IllegalArgEx that numHits should be > 0. While this is a correct behavior on their part, I think the behavior in DS is wrong. It's an optimization to ask for min(topN, reader.maxDoc(), i.e. if it just delegated topN all was well. So if we'd like to keep the optimization, we should at least make it min(topN,maxDoc+1), because there's nothing technically wrong from running a search against an empty index.
