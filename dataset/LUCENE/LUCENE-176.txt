Summary:
BooleanQuery$TooManyClauses
Description:
Happens when a RangeQuery is performed on a large range:
org.apache.lucene.search.BooleanQuery$TooManyClauses
at org.apache.lucene.search.BooleanQuery.add(BooleanQuery.java:109)
at org.apache.lucene.search.BooleanQuery.add(BooleanQuery.java:101)
at org.apache.lucene.search.RangeQuery.rewrite(RangeQuery.java:137)
at org.apache.lucene.search.BooleanQuery.rewrite(BooleanQuery.java:244)
at org.apache.lucene.search.IndexSearcher.rewrite(IndexSearcher.java:188)
at org.apache.lucene.search.Query.weight(Query.java:120)
at org.apache.lucene.search.IndexSearcher.search(IndexSearcher.java:128)
Looking into the source, I found that the RangeQuery is "unrolled" into a vast
sequence of term queries; and throws an exception when 1024 is reached.
Is there a workaround for that situation ?
Otherwise a RangeQuery would become practically useless...
