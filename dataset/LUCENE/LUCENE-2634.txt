Summary:
IndexReader.isCurrent() lies if documents were only removed by latest commit
Description:
Usecase is as following:
1. Get indexReader via indexWriter.
2. Delete documents by Term via indexWriter.
3. Commit indexWriter.
4. indexReader.isCurrent() returns true.
Usually there is a check if index reader is current. If not then it is reopened (re-obtained via writer or ect.). But this causes the problem when documents can still be found through the search after deletion.
Testcase is attached.
