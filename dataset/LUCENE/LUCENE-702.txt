Summary:
Disk full during addIndexes(Directory[]) can corrupt index
Description:
This is a spinoff of LUCENE-555
If the disk fills up during this call then the committed segments file can reference segments that were not written. Then the whole index becomes unusable.
Does anyone know of any other cases where disk full could corrupt the index?
I think disk full should worse lose the documents that were "in flight" at the time. It shouldn't corrupt the index.
