Summary:
Hits.length() returns to large value
Description:
Hits hits = searcher.search(...);
for(int i = 0; i < hits.length(); ++i) {
int x = hits.id;
...
}
throws java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 100 >= 100
I think that means hits.length() returns an in valid value 101.
After a first look the reason could be the initialization of the hitcounter
in IndexSearcher.search(Query, Filter, int). There the counter is set to 1
and than incremented for every hit. Hits value will then be propagated to
Hits.length.
