Summary:
FunctionRangeQuery and FunctionMatchQuery can pollute the QueryCache
Description:
The QueryCache assumes that queries will return the same set of documents when run over the same segment, independent of all other segments held by the parent IndexSearcher. However, both FunctionRangeQuery and FunctionMatchQuery can select hits based on score, which depend on term statistics over the whole index, and could therefore theoretically return different result sets on a given segment.
