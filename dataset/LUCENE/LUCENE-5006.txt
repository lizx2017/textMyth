Summary:
Simplify / understand IndexWriter/DocumentsWriter synchronization
Description:
The concurrency in IW/DW/BD is terrifying: there are many locks involved, not just intrinsic locks but IW also has fullFlushLock, commitLock, and there are no clear rules about lock order to avoid deadlocks like LUCENE-5002.
We have to somehow simplify this, and define the allowed concurrent behavior eg when an app calls deleteAll while other threads are indexing.
