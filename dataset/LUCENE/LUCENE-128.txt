Summary:
In J2SDK 1.5.0 (Tiger) enum is a keyword
Description:
Hi!
Tiger adds extensions to the Java Programming Language (JSR201). One is
"Enumerations", which required to add the new keyword enum.
I just made a grep (grep -lrw) over some sources and found some Apache projects
using enum as a word.
To be compliant with the new specification, please check that enum is not used
as a variable, field or method name.
Regards,
Robert
