Summary:
PostingsEnum impls should respect documented behavior when no positions exist
Description:
PostingsEnum.nextPositions says that if no positions exist, NO_MORE_POSITIONS will be returned on the first call (actually it refers to DocsEnum.NO_MORE_DOCS, which should be changed since DocsEnum doesn't exist on trunk). At least one impl (BlockDocsEnum) does assert false inside nextPosition(). This means if you have assertions turned on (e.g. in a test) you get an assertion here, when the behavior should return NO_MORE_POSITIONS. I'm still going through all the implementations, but I also see MultiTermHighlighting which returns Integer.MAX_VALUE. I think we should clean up all these implementations which have no positions (including maybe the fake scorers that are copied around in a lot of places?) to return NO_MORE_POSITIONS.
