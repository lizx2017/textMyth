Summary:
Fuzzy Searches do not get a boost of 0.2 as stated in "Query Syntax" doc
Description:
According to the website's "Query Syntax" page, fuzzy searches are given a
boost of 0.2. I've found this not to be the case, and have seen situations where
exact matches have lower relevance scores than fuzzy matches.
Rather than getting a boost of 0.2, it appears that all variations on the term
are first found in the model, where dist* > 0.5.
dist = levenshteinDistance / length of min(termlength, variantlength)
This then leads to a boolean OR search of all the variant terms, each of whose
boost is set to (dist - 0.5)*2 for that variant.
The upshot of all of this is that there are many cases where a fuzzy match will
get a higher relevance score than an exact match.
See this email for a test case to reproduce this anomalous behaviour.
