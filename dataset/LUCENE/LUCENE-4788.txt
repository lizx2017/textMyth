Summary:
Out of date code examples
Description:
The following API documents have code examples:
http://lucene.apache.org/core/4_1_0/facet/org/apache/lucene/facet/index/OrdinalMappingAtomicReader.html
http://lucene.apache.org/core/4_1_0/facet/org/apache/lucene/facet/index/OrdinalMappingAtomicReader.html
"// merge the old taxonomy with the new one.
OrdinalMap map = DirectoryTaxonomyWriter.addTaxonomies();"
The two code examples call the DirectoryTaxonomyWriter.addTaxonomies method. Lucene 3.5 has that method, according to its document:
http://lucene.apache.org/core/old_versioned_docs/versions/3_5_0/api/all/org/apache/lucene/facet/taxonomy/directory/DirectoryTaxonomyWriter.html
However, lucene 4.1 does not have such a method, according to its documentï¼š
http://lucene.apache.org/core/4_1_0/facet/org/apache/lucene/facet/taxonomy/directory/DirectoryTaxonomyWriter.html
Please update the code examples to reflect the latest implementation.
