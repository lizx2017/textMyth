Summary:
Update Spatial4j to 0.4.1
Description:
A user reported a fairly serious issue affecting the latest version of Spatial4j 0.4
https://github.com/spatial4j/spatial4j/issues/72 "JtsSpatialContextFactory and geo=false with worldBounds fails"
I've already fixed this locally and I'll push out a bug-fix Spatial4j 0.4.1. Upgrading will be a complete drop-in replacement. Heck I could do that now but as I work with the user who found the bug I want to see if there's any other problem.
