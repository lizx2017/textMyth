Summary:
BooleanScorer2 does not compile with ecj
Description:
BooleanScorer2, derived from scorer, has two inner classes both derived, ultimately, from Scorer.
As such they all define doc() or inherit it.
ecj produces an error when doc() is called from score in the inner classes in the methods
countingDisjunctionSumScorer
and
countingConjunctionSumScorer
The error message is:
The method doc is defined in an inherited type and in an enclosing scope.
The affected lines are: 160, 161, 178, and 179
I have run the junit test TestBoolean2 (as well as all the others) with
doc()
changed to
BooleanScorer2.this.doc()
and also to:
this.doc();
The result was that the tests passed for both.
I added debug statements to all the doc methods and the score methods in the affected classes, but I could not determine what it should be.
