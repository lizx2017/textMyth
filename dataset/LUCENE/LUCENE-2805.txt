Summary:
SegmentInfos shouldn't blindly increment version on commit
Description:
SegmentInfos currently increments version on the assumption that there are always changes.
But, both DirReader and IW are more careful about tracking whether there are changes. DirReader has hasChanges and IW has changeCount. I think these classes should notify the SIS when there are in fact changes; this will fix the case Simon hit on fixing LUCENE-2082 when the NRT reader thought there were changes, but in fact there weren't because IW simply committed the exact SIS it already had.
