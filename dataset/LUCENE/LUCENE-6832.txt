Summary:
SynonymFilter behaves not as expected with "ignoreCase=true"
Description:
SynonymFilter with "ignoreCase=true" does not work as expected:
Uppercase words in the SynonymMap are never matched
Uppercase words will be lowercase in the resulting TokenStream regardless if being matched or not
It seems like the SynonymMap pretty much screws up if you pass it an uppercase version of a word.
