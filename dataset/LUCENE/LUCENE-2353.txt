Summary:
Config incorrectly handles Windows absolute pathnames
Description:
I have no idea how no one ran into this so far, but I tried to execute an .alg file which used ReutersContentSource and referenced both docs.dir and work.dir as Windows absolute pathnames (e.g. d:\something). Surprisingly, the run reported an error of missing content under benchmark\work\something.
I've traced the problem back to Config, where get(String, String) includes the following code:
    if (sval.indexOf(":") < 0) {
      return sval;
    }
    // first time this prop is extracted by round
    int k = sval.indexOf(":");
    String colName = sval.substring(0, k);
    sval = sval.substring(k + 1);
    ...
It detects ":" in the value and so it thinks it's a per-round property, thus stripping "d:" from the value ... fix is very simple:
    if (sval.indexOf(":") < 0) {
      return sval;
    } else if (sval.indexOf(":\\") >= 0) {
      // this previously messed up absolute path names on Windows. Assuming
      // there is no real value that starts with \\
      return sval;
    }
    // first time this prop is extracted by round
    int k = sval.indexOf(":");
    String colName = sval.substring(0, k);
    sval = sval.substring(k + 1);
I'll post a patch w/ the above fix + test shortly.
