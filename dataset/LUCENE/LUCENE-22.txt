Summary:
Parse Aborted: Lexical error
Description:
This report is for Lucene 1.2 RC4.
When indexing a 4 MB size text file using the HTMLIndexer from the demo package
I get the following error:
Parse Aborted: Lexical error at line 106377, column 64. Encountered: "=" (61),
after : "".
The line actually contains nothing more than a lot of spaces followed by word,
so nothing special.
If I delete the line, the error still occurs.
If I crop the file so that the file contains less than 106377 lines, the error
still occurs.
If I crop the file further, at a certain point the error disappears.
The error does not occur when using the IndexFiles indexer.
