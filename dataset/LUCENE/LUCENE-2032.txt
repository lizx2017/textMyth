Summary:
Spatial Filters not Serializable
Description:
I am using Lucene in a distributed setup.
The Filters in the spatial project aren't Serializable even though it inherits it from Filter. Filter is a Serializable class.
DistanceFilter contains the non-Serializable class WeakHashMap.
CartesianShapeFilter contains the non-Serializable class java.util.logging.Logger
