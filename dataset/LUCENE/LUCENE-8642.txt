Summary:
RamUsageTester.sizeOf ignores arrays and collections if --illegal-access=deny
Description:
We have a silent fall-through on catch clause there if a field is inaccessible. This causes all collections to not be recursively descended into.
We could hack it so that collection objects are counted "manually". Or we could propagate illegal access exception from ram tester, detect which tests/ objects do try to measure collection objects and either remove them (if it's not possible to measure accurately) or change them (if it is possible to estimate the size in a different way).
Looking for feedback on this one.
