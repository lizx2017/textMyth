Summary:
Several ToParentBlockJoinQuery/Collector issues
Description:
I hit several issues with ToParentBlockJoinQuery/Collector:
If a given Query sometimes has no child matches then we could hit
AIOOBE, but should just get 0 children for that parent
TPBJC.getTopGroups incorrectly throws IllegalArgumentException
when the child query happens to have no matches
We have checks that user didn't accidentally pass a child query
that matches parent docs ... they are only assertions today but I
think they should be real checks since it's easy to screw up
