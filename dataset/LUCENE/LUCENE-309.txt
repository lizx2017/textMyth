Summary:
[PATCH] IndexSearcher.search(query,filter,nDocs) accepts zero nDocs
Description:
This caused an npe from the ht.top().score lateron.
The root cause was a bug in a test case, which took
more time to track down than would have been necessary
with the attached patch.
The patch throws an IllegalArgumentException for non positive nDocs.
All current tests pass with the patch applied.

Paul
