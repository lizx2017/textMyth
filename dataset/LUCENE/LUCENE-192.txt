Summary:
[PATCH] Allowing '-'/'+' in terms
Description:
I suggest to change the definition of term character in QueryParser.jj
from
<#_TERM_CHAR: ( <_TERM_START_CHAR> <_ESCAPED_CHAR> ) >
to
<#_TERM_CHAR: ( <_TERM_START_CHAR> <_ESCAPED_CHAR> "-" "+" ) >
As a result query parser will read '-' and '+' within words (such as tft-monitor
or Sysh1-1) as one term, which will be tokenized by the used analyzer
and end up in a term query or phrase query depending if it create one ore
more tokens.
So with StandardAnalyzer a query tft-monitor would get a phrase query "tft
monitor" and Sysh1-1 a term query for "Sysh1-1".
Searching tft-monitor as a phrase "tft monitor" is not exact but the best
aproximation possible once you indexed tft-monitor as tokens tft and monitor.
Currently query parser interpret every '-' or '+' as operators, which means
that 'tft-monitor' gets parsed as tft AND NOT monitor, which probably isn't what
the user wanted.
The effect of '-'/'+' not occuring within a word is not changed, so
tft -monitor will still search for 'tft AND NOT monitor'.
All regression tests pass with the change.
I didn't add a patch-file, because I think it's easy to change queryParser.jj by
hand.
