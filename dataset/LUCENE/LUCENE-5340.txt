Summary:
build not respecting JAVA_HOME
Description:
I set JAVA_HOME to 1.6.0_37, yet the queryparser.jar that is constructed looks like this:
Manifest-Version: 1.0
Ant-Version: Apache Ant 1.8.2
Created-By: 1.7.0_25-b15 (Oracle Corporation)
Extension-Name: org.apache.lucene
Specification-Title: Lucene Search Engine: queryparser
Specification-Version: 4.6.0
Specification-Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation
Implementation-Title: org.apache.lucene
Implementation-Version: 4.6.0 1541637 - rmuir - 2013-11-13 12:57:01
Implementation-Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation
X-Compile-Source-JDK: 1.6
X-Compile-Target-JDK: 1.6
It could just be packaging, or maybe just nightly smoke, or maybe just the build in general: I havent narrowed it down yet.
