Summary:
Cannot delete individual fields from index
Description:
This is based upon the following tickets:
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-12185
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-8235
I'd like a way to be able to clear and recreate a specific field so I don't have to completely reindex if I change a field type.
It's a real pain if you change a specific field from single valued to multivalued, you have to delete the entire index from disk and start from scratch.
As being able to modify a field is not an intended feature, It'd be preferable if a field could be at least deleted and recreated to deal with this scenario.
