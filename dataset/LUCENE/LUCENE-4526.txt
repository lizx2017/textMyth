Summary:
Allow runtime settings on Codecs
Description:
Today we expose termIndexInterval and termIndexDivisor via several APIs and they are deprecated. Those settings are 1. codec / postingformat specific and 2. not extendable. We should provide a more flexible way to pass information down to our codecs.
