Summary:
FilterScorer to override more super-class methods
Description:
Scorer.java has non-abstract non-final non-private non-static methods (getChildren, getWeight) which the FilterScorer.java class does not override.
Proposed changes:
Option 1: Add the missing methods.
Option 2: Make the missing methods final in the non-Filter base class.
Either way, add TestFilterScorer.java class similar to TestFilterWeight.java class.
Optional bonus (as a separate patch?):
TestFilterWeight, TestFilterCodecReader, TestMergePolicyWrapper and possibly other tests all have implTestDeclaredMethodsOverridden(superClass, subClass, excusedMethods) logic and some sort of lucene/test-framework util FilterTestUtils.java class with a static implTestDeclaredMethodsOverridden method could perhaps be factored out.
