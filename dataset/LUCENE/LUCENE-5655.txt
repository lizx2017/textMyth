Summary:
Hunspell and suggester should make their temp dir configurable
Description:
Both the hunspell dictionary and search suggesters use OfflineSorter. However, the constructor they use always uses java.io.tmpdir (and will fail if the tmpdir does not already exist).
Both of these should have constructors that allow passing in the tmpdir to use.
