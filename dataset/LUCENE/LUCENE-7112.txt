Summary:
WeightedSpanTermExtractor should not always call extractUnknownQuery
Description:
WeightedSpanTermExtractor always calls extractUnknownQuery, even if term extraction already succeeded because the query is eg. a phrase query. It should only call this method if it could not find how to extract terms otherwise (eg. in case of a custom query).
