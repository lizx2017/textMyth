Summary:
Multiple Token Regex Search Not working
Description:
I am able to search for a regex query like H[a-z]llo but I am not able to search for a regex query like H[a-z]llo Wor[a-z]d even though I have "Hello World" in my source tree. I am not able to search multi-word regex queries.
I am using OpenGrok which is, in turn, using org.apache.lucene.search.RegexpQuery class of Lucene 6.5.0 which extends AutomatonQuery.
I have indexed the data based on whitespace tokenization.
