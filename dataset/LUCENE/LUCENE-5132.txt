Summary:
Spatial RPT CONTAINS predicate will fail with NPE when there's no indexed data
Description:
If there is no indexed spatial data, the SpatialRecursivePrefixTree strategy will fail with an NPE if the Contains predicate is used. I'm not certain but it might fail even when there is data, when termsEnum reaches the end.
