Summary:
Facet userguide link is broken after "ant javadocs-all"
Description:
Spinoff from http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/lucene-java-user/201112.mbox/%3CCAO9cvUaZePZ3faWo==Xx7X8-5+snWLsbDqqjo_N-YCxR0LJFpQ@mail.gmail.com%3E.
When javadocs-all is run, the userguide is not copied at all, and therefore the link is broken. Two options: inline the userguide in package/overview.html or fix the Ant target to copy the userguide correctly.
Thanks Lukas for reporting this.
