Summary:
DocValuesRangeQuery.newLongRange behaves incorrectly for Long.MAX_VALUE and Long.MIN_VALUE
Description:
It seems that the following queries return all documents, which is unexpected:
DocValuesRangeQuery.newLongRange("dv", Long.MAX_VALUE, Long.MAX_VALUE, false, true);
DocValuesRangeQuery.newLongRange("dv", Long.MIN_VALUE, Long.MIN_VALUE, true, false);
In Solr, floats and doubles are converted to longs and -0d gets converted to Long.MIN_VALUE, and queries like {-0d TO 0d] could fail due to this, returning all documents in the index.
