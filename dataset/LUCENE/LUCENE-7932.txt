Description:
Hi Lucene Team,
Here I explained more about issue facing after querying using org.apache.lucene.search.IndexSearcher API.
Here I am just giving examples of our project with field names (Not related with Lucene):
In our document which needs to be archived having key fields and non-key fields.
A> Key fields:
1. LocationCode (DataType=long)
2. CollectionObjectID (DataType=long)
B> Non-key fields
Category (DataType=string)
Steps we followed:
1. Step 1: We stored multiple document records with category values as below in index files.
LocationCode = 1 Category =b
LocationCode = 2  Category =BC
LocationCode =3  Category =bcd
2. In Step 2: we query for records and we pass query parameters as below.
a) LocationCode=1 and Category =a
Result= all records displayed
b) LocationCode=1 and  Category =A 
 Result= all records displayed
I faced above issue in Lucene 5.3.
Later I found even Lucene 6.6 is also having same issue.
