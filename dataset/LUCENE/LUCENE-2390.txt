Summary:
contrib/remote tests fail randomly
Description:
The contrib/remote tests will fail randomly.
This is because they use this _TestUtil.getRandomSocketPort() which
simply generates a random number, but if this is already in use, it will fail.
Additionally there is duplicate RMI logic across all 3 test classes.
