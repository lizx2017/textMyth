Summary:
Payload null value exception handling
Description:
If-Condition to check payload null value in PayloadScoreQuery.java was removed in LUCENE-8038. Because of that, regarding of the payload value, payloadsSeen is always getting increment. This has compromised the overall score of the document(for instance, as payloadSeens is always greater than 0, docScore() in MinPayloadFunction.java only returns payloadScore which can be zero depending on the payload value). Ideally, it should've returned 1 in case of payload==null.
I have added a simple patch to get started, Please let me know if it needs any improvements. 
Thanks in advance.
