Summary:
Can '*' or '?' symbol be used as the first character of a search?
Description:
Do get me wrong, I did read the Parser Syntax, and understand that:
"Note: You cannot use a * or ? symbol as the first character of a search."
However, It would have been nice for this feature. I made the following
changes to QueryParser.jj, and it seems work fine. I am not sure if there is
any side effect though. Can someone verify this?
Change from:
<WILDTERM: <_TERM_START_CHAR>
(<_TERM_CHAR> ( [ "", "?" ] )) >
To:
<WILDTERM: (<_TERM_CHAR> ( [ "", "?" ] )) >
