Summary:
GeoShape intersects filter omitted matching docs
Description:
SpatialPrefixTree#recursiveGetNodes uses an optimization that prevents
recursion into the deepest tree level if a parent node in the penultimate
level covers all its children. This produces a bug if the optimization
happens both at indexing and at query/filter time.
