Summary:
Javadocs build fails with Java 8 update 121
Description:
Oracle released the recent Java 8 security update (u121). The Jenkins builds fail with the following error while building the Javadocs:
  [javadoc] Constructing Javadoc information...
  [javadoc] javadoc: error - Argument for -bottom contains JavaScript.
  [javadoc] Use --allow-script-in-comments to allow use of JavaScript.
  [javadoc] 1 error
This is caused by the Javascript added to pretty-print code examples. We load this in the page footer "<bottom>" parameter.
Surely, it will be posisble to simply add the mentioned argument, but this will break builds with earlier Java 8 versions.
This is nowhere documented, I haven't seen any documentation about this flag nowhere, so I assume this is a bug in Java. They can't change or add command line parameters in minor updates of Java 8. I will ask on the OpenJDK mailing lists if this is a bug (maybe accidentally backported from Java 9).
