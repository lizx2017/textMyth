Summary:
The token types of the standard tokenizer is not accessible
Description:
The StandardTokenizerImpl not being public, these token types are not accessible :
public static final int ALPHANUM          = 0;
public static final int APOSTROPHE        = 1;
public static final int ACRONYM           = 2;
public static final int COMPANY           = 3;
public static final int EMAIL             = 4;
public static final int HOST              = 5;
public static final int NUM               = 6;
public static final int CJ                = 7;
/**
 * @deprecated this solves a bug where HOSTs that end with '.' are identified
 *             as ACRONYMs. It is deprecated and will be removed in the next
 *             release.
 */
public static final int ACRONYM_DEP       = 8;

public static final String [] TOKEN_TYPES = new String [] {
    "<ALPHANUM>",
    "<APOSTROPHE>",
    "<ACRONYM>",
    "<COMPANY>",
    "<EMAIL>",
    "<HOST>",
    "<NUM>",
    "<CJ>",
    "<ACRONYM_DEP>"
};
So no custom TokenFilter can be based of the token type. Actually even the StandardFilter cannot be writen outside the org.apache.lucene.analysis.standard package.
