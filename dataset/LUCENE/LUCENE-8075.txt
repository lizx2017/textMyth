Summary:
Possible null pointer dereference in core/src/java/org/apache/lucene/codecs/blocktree/IntersectTermsEnum.java
Description:
Possible null pointer dereference in core/src/java/org/apache/lucene/codecs/blocktree/IntersectTermsEnum.java.
at line 119. The fr.index may be NULL. This result is based on static analysis tools and the details are shown below:
*
106: if (fr.index == null) {

107:      fstReader = null;  // fr.index is Known NULL here.
    } else {
      fstReader = fr.index.getBytesReader();
    }

    // TODO: if the automaton is "smallish" we really
    // should use the terms index to seek at least to
    // the initial term and likely to subsequent terms
    // (or, maybe just fallback to ATE for such cases).
    // Else the seek cost of loading the frames will be
    // too costly.

119:    final FST.Arc<BytesRef> arc = fr.index.getFirstArc(arcs[0]); 
//  fr.index is dereferenced here and fr.index can be NULL if 107 is arrived.
*
It is not sure if fr.index can be NULL in runtime.
We think it is reasonable to fix it by a test if fr.index is NULL and an error handling.
