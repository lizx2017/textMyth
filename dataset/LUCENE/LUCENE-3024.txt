Summary:
If index has more than Integer.MAX_VALUE terms, seeking can it AIOOBE due to long/int overflow
Description:
Tom hit a new long/int overflow case: http://markmail.org/thread/toyl2ujcl4suqvf3
This is a regression, in 3.1, introduced with LUCENE-2075.
Worse, our Test2BTerms failed to catch this, so I've fixed that test to show the failure.
