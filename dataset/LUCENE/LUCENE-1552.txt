Summary:
IndexWriter.addIndexes(IndexReader[] readers) doesn't correctly handle exception success flag.
Description:
After this bit of code in addIndexes(IndexReader[] readers)
try
{ flush(true, false, true); optimize(); // start with zero or 1 seg success = true; }
finally
{ // Take care to release the write lock if we hit an // exception before starting the transaction if (!success) releaseWrite(); }
The success flag should be reset to "false" because it's used again in another try/catch/finally block.
TestIndexWriter.testAddIndexOnDiskFull() sometimes will hit this bug; but it's infrequent.
