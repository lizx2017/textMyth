Summary:
UnifiedHighlighter does not work with Surround query parser (SurroundQParser)
Description:
I'm attempting to use the UnifiedHighlighter in conjunction with queries parsed by Solr's SurroundQParserPlugin. When doing so, the response yields empty arrays for documents that should contain highlighted snippets.
I've attached a test for UnifiedHighlighter that uses the surround's QueryParser and preprocesses the query in a similar fashion as SurroundQParser, which results in test failure.  When creating a SpanQuery directly (rather via surround's QueryParser), the test passes.
The problem can be isolated to the code path initiated by UnifiedHighlighter.extractTerms(), which uses EMPTY_INDEXSEARCHER to extract terms from the query. After a series of method calls, we end up at DistanceQuery.getSpanNearQuery(), where ((DistanceSubQuery)sqi.next()).addSpanQueries(sncf) fails silently and doesn't add any span queries.  
Another data point: If I hack UnifiedHighlighter and pass in a live IndexSearcher to extractTerms(), highlighting works.
