Summary:
ThreadAffinityDocumentsWriterThreadPool should clear the bindings on flush
Description:
This class remembers which thread used which DWPT, but it never clears
this "affinity". It really should clear it on flush, this way if the
number of threads doing indexing has changed we only use as many DWPTs
as there are incoming threads.
