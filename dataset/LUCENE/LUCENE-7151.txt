Summary:
Nested spanNear scoring error when inner clauses overlap positions
Description:
For spanNear([spanNear([contents:word1, contents:word3], 2, true), spanNear([contents:word2, contents:word3], 2, true)], 2, false)
Scores for the following two documents should be the same but are not.
doc1: [----- word1 word3 ----- word2 word3 ----- word1 word2 word3 -----]
doc2: [----- word2 word3 ----- word1 word3 ----- word1 word2 word3 -----]
The positions of the inner clauses effect the scoring for the of the final 3-term phrase. This appears to be a side-effect of the span-scoring rewrite in 5.2.
NearSpansUnordered's SpansCell.adjustMax() uses end-position values to decide maxEndPositionCell while the SpanPositionQueue uses start-position and end-position values to sort the SpanCells. This means that maxEndPositionCell will be incorrectly set or not set depending on previous positions.
I can provide example code illustrating the score error.
