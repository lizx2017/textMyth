Summary:
overview.html needs help
Description:
When you open javadocs, this is the very first thing you see (index.html).
It has a bunch of sample code and links that are broken. In some situations I can see it was updated here and there,
but others (like javadocs links) link to java 1.2 javadocs no longer online, etc.
