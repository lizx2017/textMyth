Summary:
EdgeNGramTokenFilter breaks highlighting by keeping end offsets of original tokens
Description:
When EdgeNGramTokenFilter produces new tokens, they inherit end positions from parent tokens. This behaviour is irrational and breaks highlighting: highlighted not matched pattern, but whole source tokens.
Seems like similar problem was fixed in LUCENE-3642, but end offsets was broken again after LUCENE-3907.
Some discussion was found in SOLR-7926:
I agree this (highlighting of hits from tokens produced by
EdgeNGramFilter) got worse with LUCENE-3907, but it's not clear how to
fix it.
The stacking seems more correct: all these grams are logically
interchangeable with the original token, and were derived from it, so
e.g. a phrase query involving them with adjacent tokens would work
correctly.
We could perhaps remove the token graph requirement that tokens
leaving from the same node have the same startOffset, and arriving to
the same node have the same endOffset. Lucene would still be able to
index such a graph, as long as all tokens leaving a given node are
sorted according to their startOffset. But I'm not sure if there
would be other problems...
Or we could maybe improve the token graph, at least for the non-edge
NGramTokenFilter, so that the grams are linked up correctly, so that any
path through the graph reconstructs the original characters.
But realistically it's not possible to innovate much with token graphs
in Lucene today because of apparently severe back compat requirements:
e.g. LUCENE-6664, which fixes the token graph bugs in the existing
SynonymFilter so that proximity queries work correctly when using
search-time synonyums, is blocked because of the back compat concerns
from LUCENE-6721.
I'm not sure what the path forward is...
