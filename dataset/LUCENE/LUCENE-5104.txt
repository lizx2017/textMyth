Summary:
poll-mirrors.pl needs fixed
Description:
i just noticed that poll-mirrors.pl is setup to look for the KEYS file in the release dir on each mirror â€“ Infra (wisely) tweaked the way mirroring happens recently to ensure that KEYS files are not mirrored anymore (presumably to help catch bad links advising people to download untrusted KEYS files)
we're going to need to updated poll-mirrors.pl to look for something else in each release dir ... changes/Changes.html perhaps?
