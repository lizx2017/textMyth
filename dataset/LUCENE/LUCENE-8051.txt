Summary:
Typo in LevensHtein distance
Description:
Looking into an issue in elasticsearch I notices that the Levenshtein distance in lucene is called LevensteinDistance instead of LevenshteinDistance.
The algorithm name contains an H and in the rest of the code the Levenshtein name is spelled correctly with an H.
