Summary:
Not all Filters implement equals and hash code
Description:
It appears that not all of org.apache.lucene.search.Filter classes implement equals and hash code. The ones I have seen that don't are:
org.apache.lucene.search.ChainedFilter
org.apache.lucene.search.FieldCacheTermsFilter
There are probably other ones out there as well.
