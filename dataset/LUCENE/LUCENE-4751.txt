Summary:
IndexReader close throwing NullPointerException
Description:
Hi,
Has anyone seen the NullPointerException as shown below before? We have used Lucene to build a public site search functionality.
All the IndexReader objects in there are closed appropriately except one that throws the following error and results in (too many files open) exception.
This brings the entire site down.
The lucene version we are using is lucene-core-2.9.2.jar
Any idea what could cause this exception?
java.lang.NullPointerException
