Summary:
Lucene needs to ship the JUnit jar for testing
Description:
In order for Hudson builds, etc. to work properly, Lucene needs to ship the JUnit jar and have it made available in the testing classpath. Our system reqs say 3.8.1, but I have 3.8.2 laying around, so I will update the system requirements, too.
