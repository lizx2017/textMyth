Summary:
addIndexesNoOptimize intermittantly throws incorrect "segment exists in external directory..." exception
Description:
Spinoff from here:

Here's my response on that thread:
The bug only happens when you call addIndexesNoOptimize, and one
simple workaround would be to use SerialMergeScheduler.
I think this is already fixed in trunk (soonish to be 2.4) as a side
effect of https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-1335.
In 2.3, merges that involve external segments (which are segments
folded in by addIndexesNoOptimize) are not supposed to run in a BG
thread. This is to prevent addIndexesNoOptimize from returning until
after all external segments have been carried over (merged or copied)
into the index, so that if there is an exception (eg disk full),
addIndexesNoOptimize is able to rollback to the index to the starting
point.
The primary merge() method of CMS indeed does not BG any external
merges, but the bug is that when a BG merge finishes it then selects a
new merge to kick off and that selection is happy to pick an external
segment.
