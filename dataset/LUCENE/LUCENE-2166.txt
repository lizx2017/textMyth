Summary:
If you hit the "max term prefix" warning when indexing, it never goes away
Description:
Silly bug.
If IW's infoStream is on, we warn whenever we hit a ridiculously long term (> 16 KB in length). The problem is, we never reset this warning, so, once one doc contains such a massive term, we then keep warning over and over about that same term for future docs.
