Summary:
Docvalues sorting treats empty values as the default
Description:
I found this working on Solr, Mike suggested I raise it as a Lucene issue.
This was for int fields, I'll assume the same holds for other types.
The sort order is as though the null field was explicitly set to zero, the whole idea of sorting missing first is lost.
doc1
int_dv = 0
int_sort = 1
doc2
int_sort=2
doc3
int_dv = 0
int_sort=3
sort by int_dv asc,int_sort asc gives
doc1
doc2
doc3
when it should give
doc2
doc1
doc3
