Summary:
Trivial fixes to WeightedSpanTermExtractor
Description:
The conversion of PhraseQuery to SpanNearQuery miscalculates the slop if there are stop words in some cases. The issue only really appears if there is more than one intervening run of stop words: ab the cd the the ef.
I also noticed that the inOrder determination is based on the newly calculated slop, and it should probably be based on the original phraseQuery.getSlop()
