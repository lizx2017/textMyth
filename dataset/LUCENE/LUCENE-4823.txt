Summary:
Add a separate "registration" singleton for Lucene's SPI, so there is only one central instance to request rescanning of classpath (e.g. from Solr's ResourceLoader)
Description:
Currently there is no easy way to do a global "rescan/reload" of all of Lucene's SPIs in the right order. In solr there is a long list of reload instructions in the ResourceLoader. If somebody adds a new SPI type, you have to add it there.
It would be good to java a central instance in oal.util that keeps track of all NamedSPILoaders and AnalysisSPILoaders (in the order they were instantiated), so you have one central entry point to trigger a reload.
This issue will introduce:
A singleton that makes reloading possible. The singleton keeps weak refs to all loaders (of any kind) in the order they were created.
NamedSPILoader and AnalysisSPILoader cleanup (unfortunately we need both instances, as they differ in the internals (one keeps classes, the other one instances). Both should implement a "reloadable" interface.
