Summary:
BufferedChecksumIndexInput is not cloneable
Description:
BufferedChecksumIndexInput implements Cloneable, yet its close method would return a shallow copy that still wraps the same IndexInput and Checksum. This is trappy, because reading on the clone would also read on the original instance and update the checksum.
Since Checksum are not cloneable, I think ChecksumIndexInput.clone should just throw an UOE.
