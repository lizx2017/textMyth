Summary:
Instead of docCount(), maxDoc() is used for numberOfDocuments in SimilarityBase
Description:
SimilarityBase.java has the following line :
 long numberOfDocuments = collectionStats.maxDoc();
It seems like collectionStats.docCount(), which returns the total number of documents that have at least one term for this field, is more appropriate statistics here.
