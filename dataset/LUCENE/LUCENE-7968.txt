Summary:
AnalyzingSuggester's comparator compares incorrectly
Description:
Found by LUCENE-7966, but we should fix here separate.
Currently the tie-break case of this comparator is buggy when hasPayloads=false, as it assigns negative lengths to the BytesRefs being compared. The current BytesRef.compareTo simply silently returns false in this case, hiding the bug.
