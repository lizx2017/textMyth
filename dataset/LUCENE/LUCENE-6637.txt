Summary:
FSTTester writes to CWD if -Dtests.verbose failing with AccessControlException(FilePermission)
Description:
This was found by Mesbah (M.) Alam who is testing our stuff with IBM J9. He ran tests with -Dtests.verbose=true, hitting this bug in FSTTester. I would like to remove the whole toDot() stuff there - or pass it to System.out instead. Another alternative would be to write it to FST's working dir (dir.createOutput; but unfortunately this is no OutputStream or Writer...)
Any opinions?
