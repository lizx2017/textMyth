Summary:
Using QueryFilter with RemoteSearchable = Exception
Description:
Using QueryFilter with a RemoteSearchable results in a NullPointerException in
QueryFilter class (line 85):
synchronized (cache) { // check cache
cache isn't serialized an therefore is null.
I would like a late instantiation of cache:
if (cache == null) cache = new WeakHashMap();
synchronized (cache) { // check cache
