Summary:
TokenFilters with a null value in the constructor fail
Description:
While migrating from 2.4.x to 2.9-dev I found a lot of failing unittests.
One problem is with TokenFilters that do a super(null) in the constructor.
I fixed it by changing the constructor to super(new EmptyTokenStream())
This will cause problems and frustration to others while migrating to 2.9.
