Summary:
FileSwitchDirectory should uniqueify the String file names returned by listAll
Description:
Right now we blindly concatenate what's returned from primary & secondary.
But a legit use of FSD is pointing to the same underlying FSDir but w/ different impls for opening the inputs/outputs.
I have simple patch that just uniqueifies using Set<String>.
