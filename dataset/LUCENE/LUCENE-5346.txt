Summary:
Missing include path for 'build-native-unix' task in lucene-misc module on Mac OS X
Description:
ant build-native-unix produces following error
       [cc] In file included from /Users/stask/Projects/stask/lucene-4.5.1/misc/src/java/org/apache/lucene/store/NativePosixUtil.cpp:28:
       [cc] /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_45.jdk/Contents/Home/include/jni.h:45:10: fatal error: 'jni_md.h' file not found
       [cc] #include "jni_md.h"
       [cc]          ^
       [cc] 1 error generated.
I added
<pathelement location="${java.home}/../include/darwin"/>
to the build.xml of misc module to fix the issue.
