Summary:
Unexpected search results
Description:
Hello...
I'm using Lucene search with Alfresco 3.3.g (I'm not sure what version of Lucene is used), and I'm havin problems when the search get me results... sometimes one search can bring me just 1 result, but when I instantly do the same search at a second time it can bring me a lot of results...
Sometimes the search takes too much time to bring results...
and sometimes the search stops at 1000 results.
I'm using simple and boolean searches and both types have the same mistakes.
Thanks for reading and for your support.
