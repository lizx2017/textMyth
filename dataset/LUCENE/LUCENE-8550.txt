Summary:
Tessellator fails when filtering coplanar points when creating linked list
Description:
Currently when creating the linked list on the tessellator, coplanar points are filtered. The problem is the following: 
if we have three coplanar points, the code is actually removing the last point, instead it should remove the middle one.
