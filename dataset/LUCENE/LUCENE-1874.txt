Summary:
Further updates to the site scoring page
Description:
update the site scoring page - see Appendix:
Class Diagrams
Karl Wettin's UML on the Wiki
Karl's diagrams are outdated - I think this link should be pulled for 2.9
Sequence Diagrams
FILL IN HERE. Volunteers?
I think this should be pulled - I say put something like this as a task in JIRA - not the published site docs.
