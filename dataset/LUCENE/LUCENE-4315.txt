Summary:
Minor fixes for Fields abstract class, TermVectorsWriter
Description:
The Fields abstract class is a little bit inconsistent. It does not allow iterator() to throw IOException, but size() is allowed to do this. This is inconsistent, as looping through iterator always returns size without IOException.
Also Fields.size() allows -1 as return value, but almost all implementation (only MultiFields and FieldFilteredAtomicReader actually return -1) implement it in a very cheap way. This is simple statistics, we should rethink this:
TermVectorsWriter's basic merging (without optimization requires this information, also requires Terms.size())
We can default Fields.size() to count iterator (instead of abstract), if not explicitely implemented. This method is called only by tools like Luke (introspection) and TermVectors merging.
We should maybe enforce size() for Fields to return a value >=0 (Preflex also knows its size!), and if the impl class does not have it (MultiFields, FieldFilteredAtomicReader), loop by supplying default impl.
The current patch still allows -1 as return value and removes IOException from the signature.
