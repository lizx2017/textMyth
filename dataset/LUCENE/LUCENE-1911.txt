Summary:
When using QueryWrapperFilter with CachingWrapperFilter, QueryWrapperFilter returns a DocIdSet that creates a Scorer, which gets cached rather than a bit set
Description:
there is a large performance cost to this.
The old impl for this type of thing, QueryFilter, recommends :
@deprecated use a CachingWrapperFilter with QueryWrapperFilter
The deprecated QueryFilter itself also suffers from the problem because its now implemented using a CachingWrapperFilter and QueryWrapperFilter.
