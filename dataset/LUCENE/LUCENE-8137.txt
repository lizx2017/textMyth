Summary:
GraphTokenStreamFiniteStrings does not handle position inc > 1 in multi-word synoyms
Description:
The automaton built for graph queries that contain multiple multi-word synonyms does not handle gaps if they appear in the middle of a multi-word synonym. In such case the token next to the gap is considered as part of the multi-word synonym. 
Stop words that appear before or after multi-word synonyms are handled correctly in the current version but the synonym rule "part of speech, pos" for instance does not create the expected query if "of" is removed by a filter that is set after the synonym_graph.  One solution would be to reuse TokenStreamToAutomaton (with minor changes to add the ability to create token transitions rather than chars) which preserves gaps (as a transition) in the produced automaton.
