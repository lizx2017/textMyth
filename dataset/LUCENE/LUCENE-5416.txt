Summary:
Performance of a FixedBitSet variant that uses Long.numberOfTrailingZeros()
Description:
On my machine the current byte index used in OpenBitSetIterator is slower than Long.numberOfTrailingZeros() for advance().
The pull request contains the code for benchmarking this taken from an early stage of DocBlocksIterator.
In case the benchmark shows improvements on more machines, well, we know what to do...
