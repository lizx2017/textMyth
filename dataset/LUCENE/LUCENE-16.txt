Summary:
Problem creating directories for FSDirectory
Description:
There is a problem when you try to create a directory (FSDirectory) that doesn't exists and you
specified a path with a depth greater than 1.
For example: lucia/index/
The problem
lays on the method
private synchronized void create() throws IOException {
if
(!directory.exists())
directory.mkdir(); <======== HERE SHOULD BE mkdirs();
String[] files = directory.list(); // clear old files
for (int i = 0; i < files.length; i++)
{ File file = new File(directory, files[i]); if (!file.delete()) throw new IOException("couldn't delete " + files[i]); }
}
