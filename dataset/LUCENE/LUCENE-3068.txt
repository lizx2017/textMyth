Summary:
The repeats mechanism in SloppyPhraseScorer is broken when doc has tokens at same position
Description:
In LUCENE-736 we made fixes to SloppyPhraseScorer, because it was
matching docs that it shouldn't; but I think those changes caused it
to fail to match docs that it should, specifically when the doc itself
has tokens at the same position.
