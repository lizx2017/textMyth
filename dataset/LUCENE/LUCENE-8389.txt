Summary:
Could not limit Lucene's memory consumption
Description:
We are running Jira 7.6.1 with Lucene 3.3 on SLES 12 SP1
We configured 16GB Jira heap on 64GB server
However, each time, when we run background re-index, the memory will be used out by Lucene and we could not only limit its memory consumption.
This definitely will cause overall performance issue on a system with heavy load.
We have around 500 concurrent users, 400K issues.
Could you please help to advice if there were workaround  or fix for this?
Thanks.
  BTW: I did check a lot and found a blog introducing the new behavior of Lucene 3.3
