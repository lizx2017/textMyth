Summary:
Review usages of hard-coded Version constants
Description:
There are some hard-coded Version.LUCENE_XY constants used in various places. Some of these are intentional and appropriate:
in deprecated code, e.g. ArabicLetterTokenizer, deprecated in 3.1, uses Version.LUCENE_31
to make behavior version-dependent (e.g. StandardTokenizer and other analysis components)
to test different behavior at different points in history (e.g. TestStopFilter to test position increments)
But should hard-coded constants be used elsewhere?
For those that should remain, and need to be updated with each release, there should be an easy way to find them.
