Summary:
ContextQuery with empty RegexCompletionQuery produces an assertion failure
Description:
When an empty RegexCompletionQuery is provided to ContextQuery, the following assertion failure occurs:
java.lang.AssertionError: input should not end with the context separator
at org.apache.lucene.search.suggest.document.ContextQuery$ContextCompletionWeight.setInnerWeight(ContextQuery.java:296)
at org.apache.lucene.search.suggest.document.ContextQuery$ContextCompletionWeight.setNextMatch(ContextQuery.java:275)

This is a bit of an edge case, but may be concerning since without assertions enabled, you can go on to access IntsRef indices that are out of bounds.
The attached patch provides a reproduction of the issue, as the test case TestContextQuery#testEmptyRegexQuery. Note that to reproduce, Java assertions must be enabled (as in the default configuration for tests).
The patch also provides a test case for the normal behavior of an empty RegexCompletionQuery, when it is not wrapped in ContextQuery (TestRegexCompletionQuery#testEmptyRegexQuery). In this case, there is no error, and all suggestions are returned.
