Summary:
[PATCH] npe if java.io.tmpdir does not exist
Description:
In org.apache.lucene.store.FSDirectory from Lucene-1.3-final, on line 170-171:
File tmpdir = new File(System.getProperty("java.io.tmpdir"));
files = tmpdir.list();
if the directory specified by the property "java.io.tmpdir" does not exist, a
null pointer exception is thrown. Perhaps a check to see if the directory
exists is in order, and if it doesn't, use a directory you know exists (e.g. a
/temp directory in the directory created earlier in the create() method).
