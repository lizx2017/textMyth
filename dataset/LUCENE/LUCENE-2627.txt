Summary:
MMapDirectory chunking is buggy
Description:
MMapDirectory uses chunking with MultiMMapIndexInput.
Because Java's ByteBuffer uses an int to address the
values, it's necessary to access a file >
Integer.MAX_VALUE in size using multiple byte buffers.
But i noticed from the clover report the entire MultiMMapIndexInput class is completely untested: no surprise since all tests make tiny indexes.
