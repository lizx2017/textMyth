Summary:
make MultiPhraseQuery's UnionDocsAndPositionsEnum public
Description:
Somehow during flex development, we (unnecessarily, I think) lost the public oal.index.MultiTermPositions, absorbing it into MultiPhraseQuery as a private class. We should move it back to oal.index, and make it public again.
