Summary:
`ant documentation-lint` fails on a checkout with spaces in it
Description:
I haven't yet been able to figure out the cause here, but looks like documentation-lint (and hence precommit) fails on a checkout with spaces in it..
Lots of errors due to checkJavadocLinks.py

The complaint is actually valid, notice the double escape in the URLs. This seems to affect Solr documentation-lint (Lucene passes) because this problem seems to occur only with the links Javadoc considers "external" (links from Solr to Lucene) and hence puts the full path. Lucene links all have relative paths which don't have this issue.
