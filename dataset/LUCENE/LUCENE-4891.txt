Summary:
Only a part of CategoryPath is recorded if I add "me" category.
Description:
If I add type/CHAT, me, network/hanirc/chan/#sdgsdgsd as "categories" to a document and add the document to a writer as below, Only "network/hanirc/chan", not "network/hanirc/chan/#sdgsdgsd "is" recorded into a taxonomy directory. type/CHAT and me are recorded well. I confirmed it with a test.
FacetFields ff = new FacetFields(taxoWriter);
ff.addFields(doc, categories);
nrtWriter.addDocument(doc);
If I add type/CHAT, network/hanirc/chan/#sdgsdgsd to a document, everything is recorded fine.
What's wrong with "me" category?
You could clone git://snowberry.me/ZeroIrcLog.git and read the code if you want.
