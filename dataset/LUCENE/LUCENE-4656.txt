Summary:
Fix IndexWriter working together with EmptyTokenizer and EmptyTokenStream (without CharTermAttribute), fix BaseTokenStreamTestCase
Description:
TestRandomChains can fail because EmptyTokenizer doesn't have a CharTermAttribute and doesn't compute the end offset (if the offset attribute was added by a filter).
