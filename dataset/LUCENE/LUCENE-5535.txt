Summary:
DrillDownQuery not working with AssociateFacetFields?
Description:
I'm trying to use the FloatAssociationFacetField to store a float with each facet. Retrieving, summing etc. works fine for MatchAllDocumentQuery(). When I try to drilldown on one of the facets, the result is always empty.
See attached example.
