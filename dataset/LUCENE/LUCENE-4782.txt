Summary:
Let the NaiveBayes classifier have a fallback docCount method if codec doesn't support Terms#docCount()
Description:
In SimpleNaiveBayesClassifier docsWithClassSize variable is initialized to MultiFields.getTerms(this.atomicReader, this.classFieldName).getDocCount() which may be -1 if the codec doesn't support doc counts, therefore there should be an alternative way to initialize such a variable with the documents count.
