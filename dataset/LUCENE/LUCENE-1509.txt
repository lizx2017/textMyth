Summary:
IndexCommit.getFileNames() should not return dups
Description:
If the index was created with autoCommit false, and more than 1
segment was flushed during the IndexWriter session, then the shared
doc-store files are incorrectly duplicated in
IndexCommit.getFileNames(). This is because that method is walking
through each SegmentInfo, appending its files to a list. Since
multiple SegmentInfo's may share the doc store files, this causes dups.
To fix this, I've added a SegmentInfos.files(...) method, and
refactored all places that were computing their files one SegmentInfo
at a time to use this new method instead.
