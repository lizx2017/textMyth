Summary:
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in FacetsAccumulator.accumulate while indexing
Description:
It is a hard to reproduce problem, but I see it from time to time. I am indexing some 100k documents and while I am doing that, I use the search and facet module.
In some cases, I get an AIOOBE on the FacetAccumulator.accumulate method. See for example this little stacktrace:
java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 1400222
at org.apache.lucene.facet.search.FastCountingFacetsAggregator.aggregate(FastCountingFacetsAggregator.java:87)
at org.apache.lucene.facet.search.FacetsAccumulator.accumulate(FacetsAccumulator.java:167)
at org.apache.lucene.facet.search.FacetsCollector.getFacetResults(FacetsCollector.java:214)
at ...
Some more detail:
I have a index that is being written to by an IndexWriter. The index is searched by a SearcherManager that uses the same Directory. The searcherManager has a scheduled maybeRefresh each 1000ms. When refreshing, I also check whether the taxonomy has changed. If so, I replace it by the new one. I use this code:
TaxonomyReader newReader = TaxonomyReader.openIfChanged( this.taxoReader );
if ( newReader != null )
{
 this.taxoReader = newReader;
 LOG.info( "Reopening taxonomyReader because it has changed!" );
}
I will try to make it more reproducable; but maybe someone already has an idea on what might trigger this.
