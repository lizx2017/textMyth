Summary:
Hits does not use MultiSearcher's createWeight
Description:
I am developing a distributed index, using MultiSearcher and RemoteSearcher. When investigating some performance issues, I noticed that there is a lot of back-and-forth traffic between the servers during the weight calculation.
Although MultiSearcher has a method called createWeight that minimizes the calls to the sub-searchers, this method never actually gets called when I call search(query).
From what I can tell, this is fixable by changing in Hits.java the line:
weight = q.weight(s);
to:
weight = s.createWeight(q);
