Summary:
1.3 Final Release - TooManyClauses error not allowing search to work
Description:
I have an installation of Lucene that has around 35000 documents in it. When
I do a normal search that used to work on Lucene1.2 I get the exception
below. This error, is not allowing my search to work at all.
On a smaller development system with only a few documents I ran the debugger
on the code. A similar query as on the 35K system had 3 clauses with 6 nested
clauses. I notice that after the BooleanQuery.rewrite() method was called, I
had over 200 nested clauses. I am not sure what the purpose of the rewrite()
method is (weighting maybe), but it seems to be conflicting with the 1024
maxClauseCount limit.
