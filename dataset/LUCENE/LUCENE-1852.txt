Summary:
Fix remaining localization test failures in lucene
Description:
see also LUCENE-1836 and LUCENE-1846
all tests should pass under different locales.
the fix is to run 'ant test' under different locales, look and fix problems, and use the LocalizedTestCase from LUCENE-1836 to keep them from coming back.
the same approach as LUCENE-1836 fixes the core queryparser, but I am running ant test under a few locales to look for more problems.
