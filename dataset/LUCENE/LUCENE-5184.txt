Summary:
CountFacetRequest does not seem to sum the totals of the subResult values.
Description:
CountFacetRequest does not seem to sum the totals of the subResult values when the query searches in a facet hierarchy. Seemed to be better behaved in version 4.0, and changed when I updated to version 4.4, though I did have to change code as well. I am using facets to create a hierarchy. Will attempt to upload sample code.
