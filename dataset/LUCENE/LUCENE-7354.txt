Summary:
MoreLikeThis incorrectly does toString on Field object
Description:
In MoreLikeThis.java, circa line 763, when calling addTermFrequencies on a Field object, we are incorrectly calling toString on the Field object, which puts the Field attributes (indexed, stored, et. al) into the String that is returned.
I'll put up a patch/fix shortly.
