Summary:
NIOFS and SimpleFSDirectory may leak files if Channel#size() throws an exception
Description:
We call Channel#size() inside the NIOFSIndexInput ctor but ignore the fact that it can throw an IOException. I ran into this due to a ClosedByInterrupt exception which we explicitly state don't support. This can also happen due to
an IOException and we should at least not leak a file handle in such a case.
