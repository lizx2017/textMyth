Summary:
WeightedSpanTermExtractor.extract() does not recognize SynonymQuery
Description:
Short description:
In WeightedSpanTermExtractor.extract(...) method there is a long list of supported Queries. There is no SynonymQuery which leads to extractUnknownQuery() that does nothing. It would be really nice to have SynonymQuery covered as well.
Long description:
I'm trying to highlight an external text using a Highlighter. The query is created by QueryParser. If the created query is simple it works like a charm. The problem is when parsed query contains SynonymQuery â€“ it happens, when stemmer returns multiple stems, which is not uncommon for Polish language.
Btw. this is my first jira issue.
