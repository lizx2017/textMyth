Summary:
[PATCH] "segments" timestamp patch
Description:
This looks hacky to me, esp. without this behaviour being documented in the
Javadocs, but we have no better solution now.
A patch from "Hani Suleiman" <hani@formicary.net>
NOTE: the attached patch is being uploaded from a Winblows machine, so it will
have Winblows EOL characters, which should be converter to UNIX ones, before
applying and committing the patch. (dos2unix or perl -pi.bak -e 's/\r\n/\n/g'
