Summary:
[PATCH] HighlighterTest doesn't work due to changes in Fuzzy Query
Description:
hi,
Highlighter's junit test in lucene sandbox doesn't work any longer due to
changes in Fuzzy Query. To make the test work again we have to set the fuzzy
prefix length to 0. With the current implementation, no hits where found for the
query "Kinnedy~". To make it work again, i added a seperate search function
processing the fuzzy query. The new implementation can be found in the attached
diff file.
