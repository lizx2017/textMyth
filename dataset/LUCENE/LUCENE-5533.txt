Summary:
TaxonomyFacetSumIntAssociations overflows, unpredicted results
Description:
TaxonomyFacetSumIntAssociations extends IntTaxonomyFacets which uses a int[] to store values. If you sum a lot of integers in the IntAssociatoins, the int will overflow.
The easiest fix seems to change the value[] to long?
