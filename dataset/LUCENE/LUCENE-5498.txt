Summary:
SortingAtomicReader should be package private
Description:
The intended purpose of this reader is to allow you to sort your entire index with IW.addIndexes(IR).
Perhaps we should supply some kind of "tool" to do this and hide the reader. Its scary to think of someone using this for searching (based on its name and docs, its probably not clear that it would be ridiculously slow)
