Summary:
TopKFacetsResultHandler should tie break sort by label not ord?
Description:
EG I now get these facets:
Author (5)
 Lisa (2)
 Frank (1)
 Susan (1)
 Bob (1)
The primary sort is by count, but secondary is by ord (= order in which they were indexed), which is not really understandable/transparent to the end user. I think it'd be best if we could do tie-break sort by label ...
But talking to Shai, this seems hard/costly to fix, because when visiting the facet ords to collect the top K, we don't currently resolve to label, and in the worst case (say my example had a million labels with count 1) that's a lot of extra label lookups ...
