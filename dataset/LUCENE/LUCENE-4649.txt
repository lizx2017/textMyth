Summary:
kill ThreadInterruptedException
Description:
the way we currently do this is bogus.
For example in FSDirectory's fsync, i think we should instead:
} catch (InterruptedException ie) {
- throw new ThreadInterruptedException(ie);
+ Thread.currentThread().interrupt(); // restore status
+ IOException e = new java.io.InterruptedIOException("fsync() interrupted");
+ e.initCause(ie);
+ throw e;
and crazy code in IndexWriter etc that catches ThreadInterruptedExc just to restore status should be removed.
Instead the guy doing the catch (InterruptedException) should do the right thing.
