Summary:
Improve per-segment diagnostics for IBM J9 JVM
Description:
Spinoff from http://lucene.markmail.org/thread/dq4wioomu4o346ej where I noticed that the per-segment diagnostics (seen from CheckIndex) only report 1.7.0 as the JVM version, without any update level.
Talking to Robert Muir it looks like we just need to add java.vm.version and java.runtime.version sysprops into the diagnostics.
