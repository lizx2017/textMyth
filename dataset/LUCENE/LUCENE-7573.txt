Summary:
DocValuesConsumer.mergeSortedSetField should use different DV instances for ords and counts
Description:
Follow-up of LUCENE-7569 where we noticed that SORTED_SET doc values do not use a different underlying DV instance for ords and counts, which can cause bugs if both iterators are consumed at the same time.
