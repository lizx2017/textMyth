Summary:
Fix explain for global ordinal query time join
Description:
The explain methods for the global ordinal join is broken, because even in the case that a document doesn't match with the query it tries to create an explain that tells it does.
In the case when score mode 'avg' is used this causes a NPE and in the other cases the return explanation indicates that a document matches while it doesn't.
