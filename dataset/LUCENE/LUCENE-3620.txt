Summary:
FilterIndexReader does not override all of IndexReader methods
Description:
FilterIndexReader does not override all of IndexReader methods. We've hit an error in LUCENE-3573 (and fixed it). So I thought to write a simple test which asserts that FIR overrides all methods of IR (and we can filter our methods that we don't think that it should override). The test is very simple (attached), and it currently fails over these methods:
getRefCount
incRef
tryIncRef
decRef
reopen
reopen
reopen
reopen
clone
numDeletedDocs
document
setNorm
setNorm
termPositions
deleteDocument
deleteDocuments
undeleteAll
getIndexCommit
getUniqueTermCount
getTermInfosIndexDivisor
I didn't yet fix anything in FIR â€“ if you spot a method that you think we should not override and delegate, please comment.
