Summary:
remove legacy numerics from join/ and queryparser/
Description:
We have three modules with (temporary) dependency on backwards codecs:
join/
queryparser/
spatial-extras/
this patch handles the first two, as they are easy. spatial-extras is more complex as its legacy support is not clearly separated, so i'm not trying to address that here.
For join/ we just remove deprecations. For queryparser/, same thing, except since solr exposes the xml queryparser, i moved the LegacyRangeQueryBuilder to solr and hooked it into its subclass of the parser.
