Summary:
Fix NPE on TopFieldCollectors created with trackTotalHits=false
Description:
`TopFieldCollectors` are now able to early terminate queries if the index sort matches the search sort. The collector checks the index sort only if it was created with `trackTotalHits=false` but it fails with an NPE if the index is not sorted (index sort is null). We should let users set `trackTotalHits` to false even if the index is not sorted, in such case early termination is not applicable but the collection should work.
