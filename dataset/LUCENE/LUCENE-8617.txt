Summary:
FSDirectory tries to create MMapDirectory on non default file system
Description:
org.apache.lucene.store.FSDirectory.open(Path, LockFactory) and org.apache.lucene.store.FSDirectory.open(Path) always assume the path is created on the default file system. If the path is not on the default file system MMapDirectory is the wrong choice as only the default file system can provide mmap().
In case of a non default file system SimpleFSDirectory is a good choice.
