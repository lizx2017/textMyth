Summary:
LiveIndexWriterConfig has setters that require magical order
Description:
Specifically setRamBufferSizeMB and setMaxBufferedDocs.
Furthermore these are "live" settings on IWC, so there are potential race conditions.
It would be good if there were a better API, even if that just means documenting "if both X and Y are set, X takes precedence".
