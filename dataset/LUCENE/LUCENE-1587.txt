Summary:
RangeQuery equals method does not compare collator property fully
Description:
The equals method in the range query has the collator comparison implemented as:
(this.collator != null && ! this.collator.equals(other.collator))
When this.collator = null and other.collator = someCollator this method will incorrectly assume they are equal.
So adding something like
(this.collator == null && other.collator != null)
would fix the problem
