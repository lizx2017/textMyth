Summary:
smartcn analyzer can't handle SURROGATE char
Description:
This issue is from https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/30739
smartcn analyzer can't handle SURROGATE char, Example:
    Analyzer ca = new SmartChineseAnalyzer(); 
String sentence = "\uD862\uDE0F"; // ? a surrogate char 
TokenStream tokenStream = ca.tokenStream("", sentence); 
CharTermAttribute charTermAttribute = tokenStream.addAttribute(CharTermAttribute.class); 
tokenStream.reset(); 
while (tokenStream.incrementToken()) { 
    String term = charTermAttribute.toString(); 
    System.out.println(term); 
} 
  In the above code snippet will output: 
  ? 
? 
   and I have created a PATCH to try to fix this, please help review(since smartcn only support GBK char, so it's only just handle it as a single char).
