Summary:
LatLonDocValuesField methods should be clearly marked as slow
Description:
It is very trappy that LatLonDocValuesField has stuff like newBoxQuery/newDistanceQuery.
Users bring this up on the user list and are confused as to why the resulting queries are slow.
Here, we hurt the typical use case, to try to slightly speed up an esoteric one (sparse stuff). Its a terrible tradeoff for the API.
If we truly must have such slow methods in the public API, then they should have slow in their name.
