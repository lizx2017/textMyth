Summary:
Use a separate JFlex generated Unicode 4 by Java 5 compatible StandardTokenizer
Description:
The current trunk version of StandardTokenizerImpl was generated by Java 1.4 (according to the warning). In Java 3.0 we switch to Java 1.5, so we should regenerate the file.
After regeneration the Tokenizer behaves different for some characters. Because of that we should only use the new TokenizerImpl when Version.LUCENE_30 or LUCENE_31 is used as matchVersion.
