Summary:
Geo3DPoint implementation should pay attention to the ordering of lat/lon points
Description:
The LatLonPoint API implementation pays attention to the order of the points; "clockwise" means one side of the polygon boundary, and "counterclockwise" means the complement. We need to use that in Geo3DPoint and convert into whatever the underlying GeoPolygonFactory method requires.
