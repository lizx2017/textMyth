Summary:
System Reqs page should be release specific
Description:
The System Requirements page, currently under the Main->Resources section of the website should be part of a given version's documentation, since it will be changing for a given release.
I will "deprecate" the existing one, but leave it in place(with a message) to cover the existing releases that don't have this, but will also add it to the release docs for future releases.
