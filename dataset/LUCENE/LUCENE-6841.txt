Summary:
LZ4 compression using too much CPU time
Description:
I am using Lucene for search indexing, including storing a large number of small fields, and some larger plain text fields, and searching using both exact matches and analyzed queries.
LZ4 (specifically the decompress method) is using nearly exactly 50% of the application's CPU time.
It seems to me that LZ4 is inappropriate for my use case. I note that I can choose BEST_SPEED or BEST_COMPRESSION.
Would it be palatable to add a NO_COMPRESSION option, or some way to pick and choose which fields get compressed? Perhaps a minimum length of a field could be specified before it's compressed? I'm not sure if that's possible.
If this approach, or similar is palatable, I would be happy to contribute a patch (or to consume and test a patch).
