Summary:
Use of non boolean AND at begining of search term causes error
Description:
It appears that the query parser is treating words that start with "and" as
boolean modifiers.
I have a simple search query which does a simple OR against two terms. If the
second term is a word that begins with "and", the query parser reports an
erorr with the query.
For example:
bob or andrew
as a search string will result in the error:
Encountered "AND" at line 1
There is a workaround where you wrap each term in quotation marks:
"bob" or "andrew"
This appears to comfort the query parser, however it still seems like a bug to
me.
