Summary:
IndexedField (is StringField) set to tokenized when getting the Document
Description:
I have added a Document with StringField to the index. When I search for it, I retrieve the Document from the searcher and iterate the IndexedFields. The field I have added is reported to be a 'tokenized' field.
This should not be the case, as it is a StringField and these are not tokenized.
It is very unconvenient when updating a Document with an extra field. The original fields are all set to tokenized.
I will add a TestCase that shows the unwanted behaviour
