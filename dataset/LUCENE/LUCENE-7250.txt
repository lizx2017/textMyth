Summary:
Geo3d's convex and concave polygons do not handle hole intersections properly
Description:
The addition of holes to GeoConvex and GeoConcave polygon shapes has broken two things:
(1) The edge points returned should include the hole edge points;
(2) The outer distance computation should include distance from hole edges.
This ticket is complicated by the fact that holes as provided by GeoPolygonFactory can be entirely outside of the polygon; no checking or pruning is done. It is unknown whether having edge points from outside holes will lead to improper return values for getRelationship() results.
