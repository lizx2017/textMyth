Summary:
DirectSpellChecker needs better parameter checks
Description:
This thing has a lot of parameters (and option setters too), but looks like it really needs better checks. For example if i ask for zero suggestions I think it may give a confusing NPE instead: SOLR-11858
There are probably other cases too: we should add all the missing checks and give IllegalArgumentExceptions and so on instead.
