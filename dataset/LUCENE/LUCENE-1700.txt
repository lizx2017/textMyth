Summary:
LogMergePolicy.findMergesToExpungeDeletes need to get deletes from the SegmentReader
Description:
With LUCENE-1516, deletes are carried over in the SegmentReaders
which means implementations of
MergePolicy.findMergesToExpungeDeletes (such as LogMergePolicy)
need to obtain deletion info from the SR (instead of from the
SegmentInfo which won't have the information).
