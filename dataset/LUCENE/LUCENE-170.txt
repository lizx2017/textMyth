Summary:
IndexWriter problem when create set to false
Description:
Upon creating a new IndexWriter with a String, Analyzer and false as the
boolean, if the indexes have never been written, then a FileNotFoundException
is thrown.
I would have expected it to have created the files a fresh if there are none,
otherwise use the existing files.
