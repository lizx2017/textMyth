Summary:
sketchy MockFileSystem reflection should be in AccessController block
Description:
mockfilesystems needs to handle implCloseChannel to track leaks and so on in tests. But this requires some sketchy access to internal classes (sun.nio.ch). We should allow this to be contained to just the test-framework.jar
