Summary:
FieldType problems with Points
Description:
The "copy constructor" is buggy and ignores the incoming points properties, because of a bug:
  public FieldType(FieldType ref) {
    ...
    // these two assignments have no effect. 
    this.dimensionCount = dimensionCount;
    this.dimensionNumBytes = dimensionNumBytes;
Another issue is that tokenized() returns true for all these point fields, which is bogus, and it confuses things like transitioning to points in some benchmark code (trying to clean up places still using LegacyNumeric* !!!). This code checks if (tokenized())
{ try to use tokenstream }
