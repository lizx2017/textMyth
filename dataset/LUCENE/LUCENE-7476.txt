Summary:
Fix transient failure in JapaneseNumberFilter run from TestFactories
Description:
Repeatedly running TestFactories show this test to fail ~10% of the time.
I believe the fix is trivial and related to loosing the state of the underlying input stream when testing some analyzer life cycle flows.
