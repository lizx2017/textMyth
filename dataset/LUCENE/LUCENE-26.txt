Summary:
Wildcard query only accepts 1 or more characters for prefixes (not 0 or more)
Description:
When using the WildcardQuery class to do a wildcard search with the wildcard at
the end of the string, the wildcard is treated as "1 or more" characters. This
is inconsistent with other wildcard behaviour, and undesirable. The correct
behaviour is for the wildcard to represent 0 or more characters.
The error is due to a problem in the wildcard comparison method in
org.apache.lucene.search.WildcardTermEnum.
Patch to follow.
