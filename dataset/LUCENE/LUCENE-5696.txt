Summary:
Remove Weakhashmap from CachingWrapperFilter
Description:
Filters can take up a good amount of space, I think its terrible this thing relies entirely upon weak references.
Actually I don't think it should use weak references at all, in my opinion, it should instead use a ConcurrentHashmap and coreClosedListeners to purge things.
We already ensure and test since LUCENE-5553 that these listeners are always fired on close, even under exceptional cases, so I don't understand why we need weak references anywhere.
So maybe the fix is to just move up coreClosedListener to AtomicReader? And maybe nuke getCoreCacheKey and getCombinedCoreAndDeletesKey.
