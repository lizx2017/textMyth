Summary:
NRT readers don't always reflect last commit
Description:
Two cases here:
When I pull an NRT reader from IW,
IR.getIndexCommit().getSegmentsFileName() should reflect what was
last committed, but doesn't now
If I call IW.commit(), or IW.setCommitData(), but make no other
changes, and then open a new NRT reader, I think it should reflect
the new commit, but doesn't now
