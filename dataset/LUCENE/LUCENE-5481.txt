Summary:
IndexWriter.forceMerge may run unneeded merges
Description:
I was running some tests and was surprised that IndexWriter.forceMerge caused the index to be merged even when the index contains a single segment with no deletions.
This is due to MergePolicy.isMerged which always returns false with the default configuration although merge policies rely on it to know whether a single-segment index should be merged.
