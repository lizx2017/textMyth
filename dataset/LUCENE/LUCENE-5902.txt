Summary:
Add bumpVersion script to increment version after release branch creation
Description:
Thanks to LUCENE-5898 there are many less places to increment version. However, I still think this script can be useful in automating the entire process (minus the commit). This would:
Add new sections to lucene/CHANGES.txt and solr/CHANGES.txt
Add new version constant
Change LATEST value
Change version.base in lucene/version.properties
Change version used in solr example configs
Create a BWC index and test if necessary
