Summary:
Make all resourceDescriptions of indexinputs consistent
Description:
This was weakly tested in a roundabout way by an assert that tried to read a lucene 2.x index.
We should try to make these consistent, on the other hand we should be careful about keeping the overhead of slice() relatively low (it would be nice to use this api in more places).
And such things should be tested elsewhere, e.g. BaseDirectoryTestCase
