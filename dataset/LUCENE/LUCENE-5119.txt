Summary:
DiskDV SortedDocValues shouldnt hold doc-to-ord in heap memory
Description:
These are accessed sequentially when e.g. faceting, and can be a fairly large amount of data (based on # of docs and # of unique terms).
I think this was done so that conceptually "random" access to a specific docid would be faster than eg. stored fields, but I think we should instead target the DV datastructures towards real use cases (faceting,sorting,grouping,...)
