Summary:
LUCENE-7951 broke the maven build
Description:
Trying to build Lucene/Solr using maven currently fails on branch_7x and master. The spatial-extras module has a dependency on test code from spatial-3d, but the spatial-3d module doesn't produce a test-jar.
ant handles this implicitly by allowing the modules to add specific directories to classpaths, but maven requires that all dependent code is in a jar.
I have a patch which I will upload.
