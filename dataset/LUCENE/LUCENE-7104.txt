Summary:
remove "sort missing first" from LatLonPoint.newDistanceQuery
Description:
As Michael McCandless mentioned on LUCENE-7102, we may not want to allow this.
I removed it and then made all the cleanups i easily could based on that.
Ultimately I think the code is simpler and faster (~ 15%), so we should do it?
