Summary:
Tokenizer and char and token filter subclasses are not listed in Javadoc for the parent abstract classes
Description:
Unlike in Lucene 3.6, the various subclasses of tokenizers, char filters, and token filters are not listed as subclasses on the Javadoc page for their abstract parent classes. Someone wanting to browse the full list of Lucene 4.x token filters cannot simply go to the javadoc for TokenFilter.
My understanding is that this is a side effect of the reorganization of "modules" in Lucene that occurred in 4.0. The various subclasses are reported as expected in Lucene 3.6.
Unfortunately, it is not just "optional" filters that are considered optional, but even the most basic "core" filters such as the lower case filter whose package name is in fact "org.apache.lucene.analysis.core", whcih seems to bear an obvious relationship to the package of TokenFilter, org.apache.lucene.analysis.
I consider this a regression from 3.6.
Relevant Javadoc:
http://lucene.apache.org/core/4_1_0/core/org/apache/lucene/analysis/TokenFilter.html
http://lucene.apache.org/core/4_1_0/analyzers-common/org/apache/lucene/analysis/core/LowerCaseFilter.html
http://lucene.apache.org/core/3_6_0/api/all/org/apache/lucene/analysis/TokenFilter.html
The good news is that the various subclasses of TokenFilterFactory are in fact reported on the Javadoc for TokenFilterFactory.
