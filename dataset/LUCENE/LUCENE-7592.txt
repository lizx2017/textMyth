Summary:
EOFException while opening index should be rethrown as CorruptIndexException
Description:
When opening an index, if some files were previously truncated then this should throw the more general CorruptIndexException instead of the specific EOFException to indicate to a consumer that this is not a transient or internally recoverable state.
