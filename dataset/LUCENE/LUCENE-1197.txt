Summary:
IndexWriter can flush too early when flushing by RAM usage
Description:
There is a silly bug in how DocumentsWriter tracks its RAM usage:
whenever term vectors are enabled, it incorrectly counts the space
used by term vectors towards flushing, when in fact this space is
recycled per document.
This is not a functionality bug. All it causes is flushes to happen
too frequently, and, IndexWriter will use less RAM than you asked it
to. To work around it you can simply give it a bigger RAM buffer.
I will commit a fix shortly.
