Summary:
TermVectors index files can become corrupt when autoCommit=false
Description:
Spinoff from this thread:
http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/lucene/java-dev/55951
There are actually 2 separate cases here, both only happening when
autoCommit=false:
First issue was caused by LUCENE-843 (sigh): if you add a bunch of
docs with no term vectors, such that 1 or more flushes happen;
then you add docs that do have term vectors, the tvx file will not
have enough entries (= corruption).
Second issue was caused by bulk merging of term vectors
(LUCENE-1120 â€“ only in trunk) and bulk merging of stored fields
(LUCENE-1043, in 2.3), and only shows when autoCommit=false, and,
the bulk merging optimization runs. In this case, the code that
reads the rawDocs tries to read too far in the tvx/fdx files (it's
not really index corruption but rather a bug in the rawDocs
reading).
