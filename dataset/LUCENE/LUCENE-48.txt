Summary:
wildcard query lowercase
Description:
We have a product which indexes some files. The indexer and the query parser use
the same analyzer. This analyzer applies the LowerCaseFilter to the terms. The
procedure works just fine for most of our queries, but there's a problem when a
more complex query is issued. I will describe the problem in the following examples:
Query: term1 +term2 term3
Result: Works
Query: term1 +term2* term3
Result: Works
Query: term1 +Term2* term3
Result: Doesn't work
It seems that terms containig wildcards are not processed by the analyzer.
As the indexes contain only lowercase words, there will never be hits for this
query.
