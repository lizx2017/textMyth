Summary:
[PATCH] GermanAnalyzer fails silently + doesn't close files
Description:
As mentioned on the developer list, the German analyzer will assume an empty list of
stopwords if the stopword file isn't found. I'll attach a patch that makes it throw an
IOException instead. Also the patch makes sure the file readers are closed.
