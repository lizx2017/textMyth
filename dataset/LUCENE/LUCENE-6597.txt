Summary:
Geo3d circle creation that covers whole globe throws an IllegalArgumentException
Description:
The following GeoCircle construction:
new GeoCircle(PlanetModel.SPHERE, -20.0 * RADIANS_PER_DEGREE, -20.0 * RADIANS_PER_DEGREE, Math.PI);
... fails as follows:
Degenerate/parallel vector constructed
The reason is that the plane normal vector cannot be computed in that case. A special case is warranted for circles that cover the whole globe.
