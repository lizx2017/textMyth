Summary:
IndexWriter.addIndexesNoOptimize ignores the compound file setting of the destination index
Description:
IndexWriter.addIndexesNoOptimize(Directory[]) ignores the compound file setting of the destination index. It is using the compound file flags of segments in the source indexes.
This sometimes causes undesired increase of the number of files in the destination index when non-compound file indexes are added until merge kicks in.
