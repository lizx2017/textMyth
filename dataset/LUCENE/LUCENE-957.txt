Summary:
Lucene RAM Directory doesn't work for Index Size > 8 GB
Description:
from user list - http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/lucene/java-user/50982
Problem seems to be casting issues in RAMInputStream.
Line 90:
bufferStart = BUFFER_SIZE * currentBufferIndex;
both rhs are ints while lhs is long.
so a very large product would first overflow MAX_INT, become negative, and only then (auto) casted to long, but this is too late.
Line 91:
bufferLength = (int) (length - bufferStart);
both rhs are longs while lhs is int.
so the (int) cast result may turn negative and the logic that follows would be wrong.
