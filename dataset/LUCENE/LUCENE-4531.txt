Summary:
Does CompressingStoredFieldsFormat only support less than 2G segment, thanks.
Description:
I see a note on CompressingStoredFieldsFormat.java.
>>>>
For a chunk size of chunkSize bytes, this StoredFieldsFormat does not support documents larger than (2^31 - chunkSize) bytes. In case this is a problem, you should use another format, such as Lucene40StoredFieldsFormat.
