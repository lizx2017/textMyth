Summary:
IndexWriter.optimize() does not respect maxMergeDocs
Description:
Similar to LUCENE-1012, IndexWriter.optimize() does not respect
maxMergeDocs: it always merges the index down to one segment.
I don't think we should change this for the existing optimize() since
this would be a change in behavior. I think instead in doing
LUCENE-982 (adding IndexWriter.optimize(int maxNumSegments) method) we
can have it respect maxMergeDocs.
