Summary:
Queries that reference a TermContext can cause a memory leak when they are cached
Description:
The TermContext class has a reference to the top reader context of the IndexReader that was used to build it. So if you build a (Span)TermQuery that references a TermContext and this query gets cached, then it will keep holding a reference to the index reader, even after the latter gets closed.
