Summary:
Testcase for StandardAnalyzer
Description:
As per our discussion on lucene-user, I'm attaching a unit test for
StandardAnalyzer. I wrote most of the tests from reading the comments in the
StandardTokenizer.jj grammar. Someone familiar with the grammar (and its
intent) should review the tests.
