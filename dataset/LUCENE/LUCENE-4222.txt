Summary:
TieredMergePolicy.getFloorSegmentMB returns the wrong value
Description:
public double getFloorSegmentMB() {
  return floorSegmentBytes/1024*1024.;
}
This is clearly wrong. It should be either "/1024/1024." or "/(1024*1024.)". As written, the / and * operations offset, so the value gets returned in bytes. The merge policy itself uses the value directly rather than calling this getter, so only the return value itself is wrong.
