Summary:
DirectoryReader#close can throw AlreadyClosedException if it's and NRT reader
Description:
in StandartDirectoryReader#doClose we do this:
   if (writer != null) {
      // Since we just closed, writer may now be able to
      // delete unused files:
      writer.deletePendingFiles();
    }
which can throw AlreadyClosedException from the directory if the Direcotory has already closed. To me this looks like a bug and we should catch this exception from the directory.
