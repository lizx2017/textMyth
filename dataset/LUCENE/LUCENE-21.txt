Summary:
OR returning 0 hits when one clause returns 0 hits
Description:
Version - 1.2 RC4
When a query with an OR contains a clause that results in 0, lucene returns 0
hits even if the other clause returned matches. For example, the search
expression:
freedent OR trident
returns 0 matches. However just searching on freedent returns several matches.
Searching on trident returns 0 matches.
