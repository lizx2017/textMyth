Summary:
NPE in QueryRescorer when Scorer is null
Description:
While testing out the QueryRescorer I was getting an NPE on the scorer when using a TermQuery as the rescore query. Looks like a TermQuery will return a null Scorer if the term is not present in the index segment.
Caused by: java.lang.NullPointerException
[junit4] > at org.apache.lucene.search.QueryRescorer.rescore(QueryRescorer.java:89)
