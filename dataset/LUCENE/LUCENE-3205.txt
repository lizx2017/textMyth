Summary:
remove MultiTermQuery get/inc/clear totalNumberOfTerms
Description:
This method is not correct if the index has more than one segment.
Its also not thread safe, and it means calling query.rewrite() modifies
the original query.
All of these things add up to confusion, I think we should remove this
from multitermquery, the only thing that "uses" it is the NRQ tests, which
conditionalizes all the asserts anyway.
