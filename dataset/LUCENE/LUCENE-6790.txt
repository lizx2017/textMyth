Summary:
Rollback (during tragic exception) should wait for concurrent commit to finish
Description:
Causes this test failure: http://build-eu-00.elastic.co/job/lucene_linux_java8_64_test_only/63025/
This is a regression, caused by LUCENE-6579 ... I remember hitting deadlock on that issue ... I'll try to add back acquiring the commitLock before rollback ...
The issue happens if one thread is committing while another thread is handling a tragedy...
