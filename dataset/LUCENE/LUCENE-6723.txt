Summary:
Date field problems using ExtractingRequestHandler and java 9 (b71)
Description:
Tracking bug to note that the (Tika based) ExtractingRequestHandler will not work properly with jdk9 starting with build71.
This first manifested itself with failures like this from the tests...
   [junit4]   2> NOTE: reproduce with: ant test  -Dtestcase=ExtractingRequestHandlerTest
-Dtests.method=testArabicPDF -Dtests.seed=232D0A5404C2ADED -Dtests.multiplier=3 -Dtests.slow=true
-Dtests.locale=en_JM -Dtests.timezone=Etc/GMT-7 -Dtests.asserts=true -Dtests.file.encoding=UTF-8
   [junit4] ERROR   0.58s | ExtractingRequestHandlerTest.testArabicPDF <<<
   [junit4]    > Throwable #1: org.apache.solr.common.SolrException: Invalid Date String:'Tue Mar 09 13:44:49
GMT+07:00 2010'
Workarround noted by Uwe...
The test passes on JDK 9 b71 with:
-Dargs="-Djava.locale.providers=JRE,SPI"
This reenabled the old Locale data. I will add this to the build parameters of policeman Jenkins to stop this from
failing. To me it looks like the locale data somehow is not able to correctly parse weekdays and/or timezones. I
will check this out tomorrow and report a bug to the OpenJDK people. There is something fishy with CLDR locale data.
There are already some bugs open, so work is not yet finished (e.g. sometimes it uses wrong timezone shortcuts,...)
