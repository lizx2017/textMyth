Summary:
Bad performance in PrefixQuery for large indices.
Description:
[Version is lucene-1.3-final, but that was not selectable as version above]
In org.apache.lucene.search.PrefixQuery.rewrite(IndexReader):
1. term.text().startsWith(prefixText) is checked before
term.field() == prefixField although it is much more expensive.
Why check text at all when it is the wrong field?
2. If there are many matches in the index, lots and lots of
potentially identical TermQuery's are added to the BooleanQuery.
Either it can be solved here by first adding the TermQueries to
a HashSet (so all entries in the set are unique) and then traverse
the set and add them to the BooleanQuery. Or modify BooleanQuery's
add method so it only adds if not already contained in "clauses".
