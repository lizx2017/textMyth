Summary:
Crazy checkout paths break TestXPathEntityProcessor
Description:
Same as a bug I raised for javadoc generation, my build.xml is the same as upstream, the problem is my checkout path looks like this
/home/buildserver/workspace/builds/
{search-engineering}solr-lucene{trunk}

This means that the prepare-webpages target gets its paths in the buildpaths variable as a pipe separated list like so

/home/buildserver/workspace/builds/{search-engineering}
solr-lucene
{trunk}/lucene/analysis/common/build.xml|/home/buildserver/workspace/builds/{search-engineering}solr-lucene{trunk}
/lucene/analysis/icu/build.xml|...(and so on)
Attached is a patch that makes TestXPathEntityProcessor use a url rather than the filesystem path that makes XPath / xml happier with crazy path names
