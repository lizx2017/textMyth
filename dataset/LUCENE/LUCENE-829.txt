Summary:
StandardBenchmarker#makeDocument does not explicitly close opened files
Description:
StandardBenchmarker#makeDocument(File in, String[] tags, boolean stored, boolean tokenized, boolean tfv)
BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(in));
Above reader is not closed until GC hits it. Can cause problems in cases where ulimit is set too low.
I did this:
while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null)
{ body.append(line).append(' '); }
+ reader.close();
