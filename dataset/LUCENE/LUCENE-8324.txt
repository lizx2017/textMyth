Summary:
Unreferenced files of dropped segments should be released
Description:
This has the side-effect that flushed segments that are 100% hard deleted are also
cleaned up right after they are flushed, previously these segments were sticking
around for a while until they got picked for a merge or received another delete.
Since LUCENE-8253, a fully deleted segment is dropped immediately when it's flushed, however, its files might be kept around even after a commit. In other words, we may have unreferenced files which are retained by Deleter.
I am not entirely sure if we should fix this but it's nice to have a consistent content between current files and commit points as before.
I attached a failed test for this.
