Summary:
AnalyzingInfixSuggester should not immediately open an IndexWriter over an already-built index
Description:
In tests I'm working on under SOLR-6246, I can see that attempts to open an AnalyzingInfixSuggester over a previously-built index fail, because the old suggester's IndexWriter lock is never released. The issue is that an IndexWriter is created in order to create a SearcherManager over the previously built index. But this is not necessary: SearcherManager has a ctor that takes a directory instead of an IndexWriter.
