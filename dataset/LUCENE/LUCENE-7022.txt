Summary:
smokeTestRelease.py should confirm the git revision is "recognized"
Description:
Spinoff from LUCENE-7021, but this issue aims to catch release bits built on unpushed changes in the smoke tester, by having it verify that the revision the bits were built from (stored in the JAR's META-INF) is in fact pushed to the public Apache git repository (git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene-solr.git).
This seems very important, since a git newbie like myself could easily mess something up and somehow push a release containing local (not pushed) commits that I then lose when deleting my local clone.
