Summary:
RAMDirectory reports incorrect EOF on seek
Description:
If you create a file whose length is a multiple of 1024 (BUFFER_SIZE),
and then try to seek to the very end of the file, you hit
EOFException.
But this is actually "legal" as long as you don't try to read any
bytes at that point.
I'm hitting this (rarely) with the bulk-merging logic for term vectors
(LUCENE-1120), which can seek to the very end of the file but not read
any bytes if conditions are right.
