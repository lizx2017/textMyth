Summary:
Boolean Filter does not handle FilterClauses with only bits() implemented
Description:
Some Filter implementations produce DocIdSets without the iterator() implementation, such as o.a.l.facet.range.Range.getFilter().
Currently, such filters cannot be added to a BooleanFilter because BooleanFilter expects all FilterClauses with Filters that have iterator() implemented.
This patch improves the behavior by taking Filters with bits() implemented and treat them separately.
This behavior would be faster in the case for Filters with a forward index as the underlying data structure, where there would be no need to scan the index to build an iterator.
See attached unit test, which fails without this patch.
