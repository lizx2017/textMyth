Summary:
BooleanQuery explain with boost==0
Description:
BooleanWeight.explain() uses the returned score of subweights to determine if a clause matched.
If any required clause has boost==0, the returned score will be zero and the explain for the entire BooleanWeight will be simply Explanation(0.0f, "match required").
I'm not sure what the correct fix is here. I don't think it can be done based on score alone, since that isn't how scorers work. Perhaps we need a new method "boolean Explain.matched()" that returns true on a match, regardless of what the score may be?
Related to the problem above, even if no boosts are zero, it it sometimes nice to know why a particular query failed to match. It would mean a longer explanation, but maybe we should include non matching explains too?
