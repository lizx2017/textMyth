Summary:
Suggestor Version 2 doesn't support multiValued fields
Description:
So if you use a multiValued field in the new suggestor it will not pick up terms for any term after the first one. So it treats the first term as the only term it will make it's dictionary from.
This is the suggestor I'm talking about:
