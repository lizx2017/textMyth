Summary:
Addition to javadoc for IndexSearcher/Hits classes
Description:
I've just discovered that IndexSearcher.close() should not be called while you
are still using the Hits objects returned from IndexSearcher.search(). [BTW
using 1.3-rc1]
This is intuitive from examining the source to Hits but not from any of the
documentation I've seen, please forgive me if I missed it. It should be very
easy to change the javadocs on either the Hits class or the IndexSearcher.
close() method to mention the above issue. This could save pther newbies such as
myself a few hours of pain.
Thanks
