Summary:
bufferDeleteTerm in IndexWriter might flush prematurely
Description:
Successive calls to remove-by-the-same-term would increment numBufferedDeleteTerms
although all but the first are no op if no docs were added in between. Hence deletes would
be flushed too soon.
It is a minor problem, should be rare, but it seems cleaner to fix this.
Attached patch also fixes TestIndexWriterDelete.testNonRAMDelete() which somehow
relied on this behavior. All tests pass.
