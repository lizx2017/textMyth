Summary:
Add test for IndexFormatTooOldException if a commit has a 3.x segment
Description:
We should add a 4.x index (4.x commit) with some 3.x segment(s) to our backwards tests.
I don't think we throw IndexFormatTooOldException correctly in this case. I think instead the user will get a confusing SPI error about a missing codec "Lucene3x".
