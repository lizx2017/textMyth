Summary:
PhraseQuery inconsistencies
Description:
PhraseQuery behaves quite inconsistently when the position of the first term is greater than 0. Here is an example:
    Directory dir = newDirectory();
    RandomIndexWriter iw = new RandomIndexWriter(random(), dir);
    FieldType customType = new FieldType(TextField.TYPE_NOT_STORED);
    customType.setOmitNorms(true);
    Field f = new Field("body", "", customType);
    Document doc = new Document();
    doc.add(f);
    f.setStringValue("one quick fox");
    iw.addDocument(doc);
    IndexReader ir = iw.getReader();
    iw.close();
    IndexSearcher is = newSearcher(ir);
    
    PhraseQuery pq = new PhraseQuery();
    pq.add(new Term("body", "quick"), 0);
    pq.add(new Term("body", "fox"), 1);
    System.out.println(is.search(pq, 1).totalHits); // 1

    pq = new PhraseQuery();
    pq.add(new Term("body", "quick"), 10);
    pq.add(new Term("body", "fox"), 11);
    System.out.println(is.search(pq, 1).totalHits); // 0
    
    pq = new PhraseQuery();
    pq.add(new Term("body", "quick"), 10);
    System.out.println(is.search(pq, 1).totalHits); // 1
    
    pq = new PhraseQuery();
    pq.add(new Term("body", "quick"), 10);
    pq.add(new Term("body", "fox"), 11);
    pq.setSlop(1);
    System.out.println(is.search(pq, 1).totalHits); // 1
    
    ir.close();
    dir.close();
The reason is that when you add a term with position P on a PhraseQuery, ExactPhraseScorer ignores all positions for this term which are less than P.
But this is inconsistent:
if you have a single term, it does not work anymore since we rewrite to a term query regardless of the position of the term (3rd query)
if you increase the slop, we will use SloppyPhraseScorer which does not have this behaviour. (4th query)
So I think we have two options:
either remove this behaviour and make the positions that are provided to PhraseQuery only relative (ie. fix ExactPhraseScorer)
or make it work this way across the board (which means not rewriting to a term query when the position is not 0 and fixing SloppyPhraseScorer).
