Summary:
IndexWriter.commit() does not update the index version
Description:
IndexWriter.commit() can update the index version and generation but the update of version is lost.
As result added documents are not seen by IndexReader.reopen().
(There might be other side effects that I am not aware of).
The fix is 1 line - update also the version in SegmentsInfo.updateGeneration().
(Finding this line involved more lines though... )
