Summary:
MoreLikeThis.setMaxDocFreqPct can easily int-overflow on larger indexes
Description:
  public void setMaxDocFreqPct(int maxPercentage) {
    this.maxDocFreq = maxPercentage * ir.numDocs() / 100;
  }
The above overflows integer range into negative numbers on even fairly small indexes (for maxPercentage = 75, it happens for just over 28 million documents.
We should make the computations on long range so that it doesn't overflow and have a more strict argument validation.
