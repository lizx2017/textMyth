Issue with holes in polygons
Description:
Hi,
It seems the behavior of adding holes to polygons is not behaving well. It seems it is all related to the following method:
/** Check if a point is within the provided holes.
*@param point point to check.
*@return true if the point is within any of the holes.
*/
protected boolean isWithinHoles(final GeoPoint point) {
if (holes != null) {
for (final GeoPolygon hole : holes) {
if (!hole.isWithin(point))
{ return true; }
}
}
return false;
}
The negation in the if clause is wrong. This affects two classes, GeoConvexPolygon and GeoConcavePolygon. I have ready a patch if you think it should be corrected.
Thanks,
I.
