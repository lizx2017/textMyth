Summary:
when a test's heart beats it should also throw up (dump stack of all threads)
Description:
We've had numerous cases where tests were hung but the "operator" of that particular Jenkins instance struggles to properly get a stack dump for all threads and eg accidentally kills the process instead (rather awful that the same powerful tool "kill" can be used to get stack traces and to destroy the process...).
Is there some way the test infra could do this for us, eg when it prints the HEARTBEAT message?
