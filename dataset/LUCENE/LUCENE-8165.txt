Summary:
ban Arrays.copyOfRange with forbidden APIs
Description:
This method is no good, because instead of throwing AIOOBE for bad bounds, it will silently fill with zeros (essentially silent corruption). Unfortunately it is used in quite a few places so replacing it with e.g. arrayCopy may uncover some interesting surprises.
See LUCENE-8164 for motivation.
