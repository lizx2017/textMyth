Summary:
Enforce javac warnings
Description:
Robert's comment on LUCENE-3973 suggested to take an incremental approach to static analysis and leverage the java compiler warnings. I think this is easy to do and is a reasonable change to make to protect the code base for the future.
We currently have many fewer warnings than we did a year or two years ago and should ensure that we do not slide backwards.
