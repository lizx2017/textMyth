Summary:
Duplicated classpath in facet build file
Description:
Facet module's build.xml contains both
  <path id="classpath">
    <path refid="base.classpath" />
    <pathelement location="${build.dir}/classes/java" />
    <pathelement location="${build.dir}/classes/examples" />
  </path>
and
<path id="classpath">
    <!-- TODO, cut over tests to MockAnalyzer etc and nuke this dependency -->
    <pathelement path="${analyzers-common.jar}" />
    <path refid="base.classpath"/>
  </path>
which I think is wrong.
As, as far as I can see, only the latter is actually used (probably because of its position in the build file) therefore I think the first can be just removed.
