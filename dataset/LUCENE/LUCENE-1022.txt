Summary:
IndexWriter.setInfoStream should percolate down to mergePolicy & mergeScheduler
Description:
Right now *MergePolicy and *MergeScheduler have their own ad-hoc means
of being verbose about their actions. We should unify these with
IndexWriter's infoStream. Thanks to Hoss for suggesting this.
