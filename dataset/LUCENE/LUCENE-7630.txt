Summary:
EdgeNGramTokenFilter drops payloads
Description:
Using an EdgeNGramTokenFilter after a DelimitedPayloadTokenFilter discards the payloads, where as most other filters copy the payload to the new tokens.
I added a test for this issue and a possible fix at https://github.com/xabbu42/lucene-solr/tree/edgepayloads
