Summary:
Search hits vary with wildcard term and multiple index ordering.
Description:
Using the final release lucene1.2.jar, if I perform a search using multiple
indexes and a wildcard search term, the list of search results may vary
according to the order of the physical index folders supplied.
Lucene expands a wildcard term by refering to the indexed terms contained in
the first index in the list. It then uses this expanded query for all
subsequent searches on all of the indexes. Therefore, if the first index
contains a subset of terms from other indexes, the search will fail to match
some terms from the second and subsequent indexes.
If the order of specified indexes is then changed, the number of resultant hits
using the same search term will also change.
