Summary:
explore two-phase iteration for GeoPoint query
Description:
This query today uses an approximation+confirm approach, but it all happens when you call scorer(), in a termsEnum loop.
This causes several problems (even after https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-7018) because it can do too much work, if queries have multiple values since the doc can be "confirmed" more than once.
I think it would be better to delay this confirmation as much as possible, so that other parts of the query (e.g. other filters, conjunctions, etc) can eliminate checks as well.
