Summary:
Further improve memory of FieldInfos
Description:
In LUCENE-6325, FieldInfos were improved to use an array except in very sparse cases. In the sparse cases, a TreeMap is still used. However, even in the sparse case, we can still use an array, and then use binary search. The perf will be equivalent, but memory use should be much less.
