Summary:
IndexWriter OOM handling should be any VirtualMachineError
Description:
IndexWriter is defensive in this case: this error could come from any unexpected place.
But its superclass VirtualMachineError is the correct one: "Thrown to indicate that the Java Virtual Machine is broken or has run out of resources necessary for it to continue operating."
