Summary:
DocMakers setup for the "docs.dir" property fails when passing an absolute path.
Description:
setConfig in TrecDocMaker assumes docs.dir is a relative path. Therefore it create new File(workDir, docs.dir). However, if docs.dir is an absolute path, this works incorrectly and results in No txt files in dataDir exception.
