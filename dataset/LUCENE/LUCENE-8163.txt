Summary:
BaseDirectoryTestCase.testListAllIsSorted() can create Windows-incompatible names
Description:
This test generates a random set of strings for use as filenames, and then checks that the implementation under test returns them in sorted order from listAll().  However, on Windows there are a number of filenames that are disallowed (generally old-school handle names, eg con, prn, lpt1, etc), so if the test generates one of them, and is being run on Windows, then FileSystemExceptions can be thrown.
