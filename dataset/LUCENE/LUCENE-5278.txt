Summary:
MockTokenizer throws away the character right after a token even if it is a valid start to a new token
Description:
MockTokenizer throws away the character right after a token even if it is a valid start to a new token. You won't see this unless you build a tokenizer that can recognize every character like with new RegExp(".") or RegExp("...").
Changing this behaviour seems to break a number of tests.
