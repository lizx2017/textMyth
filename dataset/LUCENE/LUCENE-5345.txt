Summary:
range facets don't work with float/double fields
Description:
With LUCENE-5297 we generalized range faceting to accept a ValueSource.
But, when I tried to use this to facet by distance (< 1 km, < 2 km, etc.), it's not working ... the problem is that the RangeAccumulator always uses .longVal and assumes this was a double encoded as a long (via DoubleField).
