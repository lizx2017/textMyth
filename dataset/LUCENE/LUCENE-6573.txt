Summary:
make all of lucene modules lucene-contrib.jar in 6.0
Description:
When we added modules, there was a big effort to make sure that there was not stupid dependencies between them. I remember spending a lot of time adding components like MockAnalyzer and switching all tests over to them so that this could be successful.
Despite that work, people just CANT RESIST DOING THIS but it makes things impossible to use. So I'd rather just make a big lucene-contrib.jar, since folks are unable to be mature about it.
