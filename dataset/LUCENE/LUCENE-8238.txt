Summary:
WordDelimiterFilter javadocs reference nonexistent parameters
Description:
The javadocs for both WDF and WDGF include a pretty detailed discussion about the proper use of the "combinations" parameter, but no such parameter exists. I don't know the history here, but it sounds as if the docs might be referring to some previous incarnation of this filter, perhaps in the context of some (now-defunct) Solr configuration.
The docs should be updated to reference the actual option names that are provided by the class today.
