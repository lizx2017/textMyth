Summary:
Filters which are "consumers" should not reset the payload or flags and should better reuse the token
Description:
Passing tokens with payloads through SnowballFilter results in tokens with no payloads.
A workaround for this is to apply stemming first and only then run whatever logic creates the payload, but this is not always convenient.
Other "consumer" filters have similar problem.
These filters can - and should - reuse the token, by implementing next(Token), effectively also fixing the unwanted resetting.
