Summary:
Potential resource leak in BigramDictionary.java
Description:
The input and output object streams are being closed in the try block. These resources will not be closed if an exception occurs in the try block
We can use the finally block to explicitly close these resources or use the new try-with-resources construct where they are implicitly closed.
