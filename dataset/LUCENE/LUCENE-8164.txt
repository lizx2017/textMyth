Summary:
IndexWriter silently accepts broken payload
Description:
IndexWriter seems to be missing bounds checks for payloads completely.
If you pass a "broken" payload (e.g. BytesRef's offset + length is out of bounds), it will silently index it as if nothing went wrong. What actually happens? Doesn't matter, we should be getting an exception.
