Summary:
"Latest SVN" needs replaced on the website
Description:
Mike ask a little while back on dev@lucene...
On the bottom right of Lucene's index.html we have "Latest SVN" but of
course it only displays this last svn commit:

  r1726344 LUCENE-6937: moving trunk from SVN to GIT. (lucene) â€” dweiss

Does anyone know how to convert this to the "Latest GIT"?
This isn't particularly straight forward, so filing an issue to track it
