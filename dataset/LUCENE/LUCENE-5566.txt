Summary:
Inconsistent search results in different threads but same query
Description:
We have a very difficult case to identify whats going on.
We have a multithreaded environment where multiple threads are trying to hit the same lucene query and getting different results each time.
For eg: Query A has returned 1 result which is running in thread 1
And same Query A is returning 0 results which is running in thread 2.
All the indexes looks fine and if we take the same query and try it in Luke and we are able to get the correct results which is 1 in this case. And we are not able to reproduce it in local environments or staging or integration but only on Production.
Trying to figure out whats going on.
