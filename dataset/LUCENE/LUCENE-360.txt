Summary:
Test compilation error
Description:
The Lucence test fails with the following error: (latest revision from SVN)
compile-test:
[mkdir] Created dir: /opt/lucene/lucene/build/classes/test
[javac] Compiling 79 source files to /opt/lucene/lucene/build/classes/test
[javac]
/opt/lucene/lucene/src/test/org/apache/lucene/index/TermInfosTest.java:89:
cannot resolve symbol
[javac] symbol : constructor TermInfosWriter
(org.apache.lucene.store.Directory,java.lang.String,org.apache.lucene.index.FieldInfos)
[javac] location: class org.apache.lucene.index.TermInfosWriter
[javac] TermInfosWriter writer = new TermInfosWriter(store,
"words", fis);
I see that TermInfosWriter was changed two days back to add another
argument (interval) to its constructor.
Mailing lists for Lucene do not seem to be responding (sending emails to
subscribe bounces back and also I do not see any mails after March 2nd being
archived in either the user or dev lists). So I am using the bug database to
inform the test failure and submit a simple patch that uses the value of 128
(the default in the TermInfosWriter class) as interval in the test case.
