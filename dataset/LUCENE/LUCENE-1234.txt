Summary:
BoostingTermQuery's BoostingSpanScorer class should be protected instead of package access
Description:
Currently, BoostingTermScorer, an inner class of BoostingTermQuery is not accessible from outside the search.payloads
making it difficult to write an extension of BoostingTermQuery. The other inner classes are protected already, as they should be.
