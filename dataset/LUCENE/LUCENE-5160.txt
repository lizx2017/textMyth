Summary:
NIOFSDirectory, SimpleFSDirectory (others?) don't properly handle valid file and FileChannel read conditions
Description:
Around line 190 of NIOFSDirectory, the loop to read in bytes doesn't properly handle the -1 condition that can be returned from FileChannel.read(). If it returns -1, then it will move the file pointer back and you will enter an infinite loop. SimpleFSDirectory displays the same characteristics, although I have only seen the issue on NIOFSDirectory.
The code in question from NIOFSDirectory:
try {
        while (readLength > 0) {
          final int limit;
          if (readLength > chunkSize) {
            // LUCENE-1566 - work around JVM Bug by breaking
            // very large reads into chunks
            limit = readOffset + chunkSize;
          } else {
            limit = readOffset + readLength;
          }
          bb.limit(limit);
          int i = channel.read(bb, pos);
          pos += i;
          readOffset += i;
          readLength -= i;
        }
