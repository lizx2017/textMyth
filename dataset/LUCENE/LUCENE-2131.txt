Summary:
the method equals in ConstantScoreRangeQuery does not compare collator property fully, this bug is similar to LUCENE-1587
Description:
if (this.fieldName != other.fieldName // interned comparison
this.includeLower != other.includeLower
this.includeUpper != other.includeUpper
(this.collator != null && ! this.collator.equals(other.collator))
) { return false; }
If this.collator == null and other.collator is not null. the equals method should return false;
but in lucene 2.4. the method return true.
