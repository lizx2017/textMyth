Summary:
IndexDeletionPolicy.delete behaves incorrectly when deleting latest generation
Description:
I have been looking to provide the ability to rollback committed transactions and encountered some issues.
I appreciate IndexDeletionPolicy's main motivation is to handle cleaning away OLD commit points but it does not explicitly state that it can or cannot be used to clean NEW commit points.
If this is not supported then the documentation should ideally state this. If the intention is to support this behaviour then read on .......
There seem to be 2 issues so far:
1) The first attempt to call IndexCommit.delete on the latest commit point fails to remove any contents. The subsequent call succeeds however
2) Deleting the latest commit point fails to update the segments.gen file to point to segments_N-1. New IndexReaders that are opened are then misdirected to open segments_N which has been deleted
Junit test to follow...
