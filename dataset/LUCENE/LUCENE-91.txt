Summary:
IndexWriter ctor does not release lock on exception
Description:
If IndexWriter construction fails with an exception, the write.lock lock is not
released.
For example, this happens if one tries to open an IndexWriter on an FSDirectory
which does not contain an Lucene index. FileNotFoundException will be thrown by
org.apache.lucene.store.FSInputStream, after which the write lock will remain in
the directory, and nobody can open the index.
I have been using this pattern – doing IndexWriter(..., false), catching
FileNotFoundException and doing IndexWriter(..., true) – in my code to
initialize the index on demand, because the app never know if the index already
exists.
