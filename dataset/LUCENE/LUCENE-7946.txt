Summary:
CharTermAttributeImpl.setLength missing bounds check
Description:
CharTermAttribute.setLength partially checks for out of bounds values (exceeds term buffer array size) but doesn't check for negative values.
This can be confusing as then the negative length will only fail or misbehave much later, for example with the first iteration of LUCENE-7940. It fails later only when we call toString() afterwards.
