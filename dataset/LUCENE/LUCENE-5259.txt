Summary:
convert analysis consumers to try-with-resources
Description:
Most of these consumers' exception handling is questionable at best.
if you do it with try-with-resources, then its obvious its correct:
try (TokenStream stream = analyzer.tokenStream("body", "testing")) {
  stream.reset();
  while (stream.incrementToken()) {
    ...
  }
  stream.end();
}
For trunk we should change the consumers to work this way. For 4.x we can simulate it with IOUtils
