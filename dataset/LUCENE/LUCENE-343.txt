Summary:
IndexReader.getFieldNames() reports too many fields
Description:
IndexReader.getFieldNames() (also in the variant with
IndexReader.FieldOptions.ALL) reports always one field too many. This additional
field has an empty name, and of course does not really exist in the index.
This bug has been introduced somewhere around the 1.2.x series, when the
getFieldNames() method was introduced, and AFAIK has been present ever since
including the CVS HEAD.
