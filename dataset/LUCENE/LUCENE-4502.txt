Summary:
Highlighter does not highlight when using large exact phrase query
Description:
For example I have the text
 
The text which appears before and after a highlighted term when using the simple formatter This parameter accepts per-field overrides.
I want to highlight this text with the query
 
String query = "\"which appears before and after a highlighted term when using the simple formatter\""
Using the EnglishAnalyzer it does not highlight.
Using the WhitespaceAnalyzer it's highlight.
If the query is smaller the hightlight is correct.
I have try to track the issue, but it go to deeply into Lucene core at NearSpansUnordered
