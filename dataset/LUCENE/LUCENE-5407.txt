Summary:
Deadlock? while indexing in cascaded threads
Description:
Apparently I found a deadlock problem with IndexWriter in a cascaded thread design to add documents (I am working on an application integrating Tika, which has the capability to add embedded documents to the index as independent documents as they are found). The attached code illustrates the problem. Sometimes it stops processing, at least one of the threads remains in WAITING state. It must be executed no more than 5 times in my environment to trigger the problem.
