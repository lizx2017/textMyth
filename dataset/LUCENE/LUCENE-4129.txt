Summary:
add CodecHeader to .frq and .prx
Description:
We did this for all other files, but not .frq/.prx.
Currently the postings writer only records itself in the blocktree terms dictionary, which is fine, but thats really documenting the .tim itself, that it is "Blocktree with Lucene40Postings metadata".
I think we should put headers in .frq/.prx as well: e.g. it could detect file jumbling.
