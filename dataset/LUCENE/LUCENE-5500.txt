Summary:
SortingMergePolicy should error if the Sort refers to the score
Description:
It should throw an exception if Sort.needsScores() == true. This does not make sense at index-time.
I think there is no reason for this method to be package-private either (as its just useful sugar, it loops over each SortField and checks needsScores).
