Summary:
Rename Sorter, NumericDocValuesSorter, and fix javadocs
Description:
Its not clear to users that these are for this super-expert thing of pre-sorting the index. From the names and documentation they think they should use them instead of Sort/SortField.
These need to be renamed or, even better, the API fixed so they aren't public classes.
