Summary:
ConjunctionScorer.getChildren does not return all children
Description:
Today it returns all scoring children and misses the `FILTER` clauses; I think we just need to save the incoming `required` parameter to the ctor and iterate over those in `getChildren` since `scorers` is a subset of `required`?
