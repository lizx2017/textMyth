Summary:
FST Sorter BufferSize causes int overflow if BufferSize > 2048MB
Description:
the BufferSize constructor accepts size in MB as an integer and uses multiplication to convert to bytes. While its checking the size in bytes to be less than 2048 MB it does that after byte conversion. If you pass a value > 2047 to the ctor the value overflows since all constants and methods based on MB expect 32 bit signed ints. This does not even result in an exception until the BufferSize is actually passed to the sorter.
