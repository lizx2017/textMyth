Summary:
check-legal-lucene always checks contrib/queries/lib
Description:
I've been noticing for awhile that the check-legal-lucene always checks /contrib/queries/lib, no matter where it is. Consequently it never finds the directory. This seems like a waste in our build and for the life of me I have no idea why it is necessary.
Offending line is:
<arg value="${basedir}/contrib/queries/lib" />
in check-legal-lucene
Patch will remove this.
