Summary:
GData Server - TestCase Deadlock StorageModifier
Description:
Solfed the racecondition deadlock while closing the StorageController.
This occured the first time hossman tried to run the test cases.
Concurrent Modification Exception while iteration over a collection in a sepereate thread â€“ ModifiedEntryFilter replaced list with array.
@Hossman if you can get to it, could you try the testcases again.
@all If you guys do have time you could run the testcases on different environment, that would help to resolve bugs in the test cases and the server.
