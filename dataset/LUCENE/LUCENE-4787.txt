Summary:
The QueryScorer.getMaxWeight method is not found.
Description:
The following API documents refer to the QueryScorer.getMaxWeight method:
http://lucene.apache.org/core/4_1_0/highlighter/org/apache/lucene/search/highlight/package-summary.html
"The QueryScorer.getMaxWeight method is useful when passed to the GradientFormatter constructor to define the top score which is associated with the top color."
http://lucene.apache.org/core/4_1_0/highlighter/org/apache/lucene/search/highlight/GradientFormatter.html
"See QueryScorer.getMaxWeight which can be used to calibrate scoring scale"
However, the QueryScorer class does not declare a getMaxWeight method in lucene 4.1, according to its document:
http://lucene.apache.org/core/4_1_0/highlighter/org/apache/lucene/search/highlight/QueryScorer.html
Instead, the class declares a getMaxTermWeight method. Is that the correct method in the preceding two documents? If it is, please revise the two documents.
