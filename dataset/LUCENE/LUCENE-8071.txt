Summary:
GeoExactCircle should create circles with right number of planes
Description:
Hi Karl Wright,
There is still a situation when the test can fail. It happens when the planet model is a SPHERE and the radius is slightly lower than PI. The circle is created with two sectors but the circle plane is too big and the shape is bogus.
I will attach a test and a proposed solution. (I hope this is the last issue of this saga)
