Summary:
deleteAll() does not remove all TaxonomyWriter files
Description:
When calling deleteAll() on the IndexWriter, the documents are removed from the index and from the taxonomy. When investigating what is happing after the deleteAll() on the disk, I see that in the index-directory I end up with just two files:
Index-directory:
segments.gen
segments_2
Taxonomy directory:
segments.gen
segments_h
BUT also a lot of 'older' files, like
_1_Lucene41_0.tip
_1_Lucene41_0.tim
etc.
It seems these files are never deleted. If you index a lot and call deleteAll a lot, it will fill up your disk.
