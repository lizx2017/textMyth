Summary:
AND NOT queries not working
Description:
I upgraded to the build from 01/25/2003 from 1.2 RC4 and found that AND NOT
queries behave just like AND queries i.e., the NOT is ignored. I am using the
query parser to run searches.
This should be fairly easy to repeat on any search index and should not require
any sample code. Note that I did a complete rebuild of the lucene search index
after upgrading.
