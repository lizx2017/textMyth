Summary:
QueryParser with wildcard search does not use Analyzer's tokenizer
Description:
Using a tokenizer that splits at underscores (e.g. SimpleAnalyzer) splits "qwert_asdfghjkl" into two words at the time of indexing.
Searches for "qwert asdf*" or "qwert_asdfghjkl" work as expected.
However, when a query contains wildcards, e.g. "qwert_asdf*" the query parser does not use the tokenizer of its analyzer to split the words and thus finds no result.
