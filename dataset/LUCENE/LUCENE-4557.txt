Summary:
Indexed Offsets Can Be Lost During Merge
Description:
Primary Use case:
Start with pre-4.0 index (no indexed offsets available)
Start indexing new documents with indexed offsets (IndexOptions.DOCS_AND_FREQS_AND_POSITIONS_AND_OFFSETS, previously was IndexOptions.DOCS_AND_FREQS_AND_POSITIONS)
merge/optimize index
newly indexed documents will now no longer have offsets available
In general, it is impossible to ever change a field to have offsets indexed when starting with an existing index as a merge will cause offsets to be removed from the index.
Desirable behavior would be for new documents to have offsets indexed properly, and old documents would have offset of "0, 0" for all positions after merging with a segment that contains offsets
Current behavior can be very dangerous.
for example:
Start indexing documents with indexed offsets
change config to not index offsets by accident
index 1 document
revert config back
offsets will start disappearing from documents as segments are merged
