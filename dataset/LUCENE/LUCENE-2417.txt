Summary:
Fix IndexCommit hashCode() and equals() to be consistent
Description:
IndexCommit's impl of hashCode() and equals() is inconsistent. One uses Dir + version and the other uses Dir + equals. According to hashCode()'s javadoc, if o1.equals(o2), then o1.hashCode() == o2.hashCode(). Simple fix, and I'll add a test case.
