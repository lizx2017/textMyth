Summary:
CustomScoreQuery Explain differs from the actual score when topLevelBoost is used.
Description:
CustomScoreQuery.java, doExplain has the following line:
res.addDetail(new Explanation(getBoost(), "queryBoost"));
This multiplies the custom score query by just the boost of the current query, and not by
queryWeight=topLevelBoost*getBoost();
which is the value that's actually used during scoring. This leads to drastically different scores in the debug info, relative to the actual score, when the query is a subquery of another one, like a BooleanQuery clause, with a non-1 boost.
