Summary:
Locking bug
Description:
In org.apache.lucene.store.Lock, line 57 (lucene_1_4_final branch):
if (++sleepCount == maxSleepCount)
is incorrect, the sleepCount is incremented before the compare causing it
throwing the exception with out waiting for at least 1 interation.
Should be changed instead to:
if (sleepCount++ == maxSleepCount)
As this is a self-contained simple fix, I am not submitting a patch.
Thanks
-John
