Summary:
GeoPointDistanceRangeQuery not valid for multi-valued docs
Description:
This query currently takes minimum and maximum range and rewrites to a boolean query of two distance queries (big NOT little).
The problem is, this rewrite is not correct if a document has multiple values in the field.
Do we really need to support this query? What is the use case? Is it a relic of people doing things like pagination or distance faceting in a very slow way? We can do these things more efficiently with other mechanisms (e.g. distance sort for LatLonPoint works well with searchAfter, can be ported to geopoint).
