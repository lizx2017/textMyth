Summary:
Tessellator should throw an error if all points were not processed
Description:
Currently, the tessellation in some situations when it has not successfully process all points in the polygon, it will still return an incomplete/wrong tessellation. 
For example the following code:
public void testInvalidPolygon()  throws Exception {
  String wkt = "POLYGON((0 0, 1 1, 0 1, 1 0, 0 0))";
  Polygon polygon = (Polygon)SimpleWKTShapeParser.parse(wkt);
  expectThrows( IllegalArgumentException.class, () -> {Tessellator.tessellate(polygon); });
}
will fail as the tessellator return a wrong tessellation containing one triangle.
