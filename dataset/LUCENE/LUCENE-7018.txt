Summary:
GeoPoint queries on multi-valued GeoPointField documents can be slow
Description:
In 5.4/5.4.1 a known bug remains for GeoPoint queries. When filtering over docvalues for a multi-valued document all values were checked regardless of an existing match. This performance bug was fixed in LUCENE-6951 and needs to be back ported to 5.4.
