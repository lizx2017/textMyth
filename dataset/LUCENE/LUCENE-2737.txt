Summary:
Codec is not consistently passed in internal API
Description:
While working on SOLR-1942 I ran into a couple of glitches with codec which is not consistently passed to SegmentsInfo and friends. Codecs should really be consistently passed though. I have fixed the pieces which lead to errors in Solr but I guess there might be others too. Patch is coming up...
