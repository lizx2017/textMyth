Summary:
Update site lucene-sandbox page
Description:
The page has misleading/bad info. One thing I would like to do - but I won't attempt now (prob good for the modules issue) - is commit to one word - contrib or sandbox. I think sandbox should be purged myself.
The current page says that the sandbox is kind of a rats nest with various early stage software that one day may make it into core - that info is outdated I think. We should replace it, and also specify how the back compat policy works in contrib eg each contrib can have its own policy, with the default being no policy.
We should also drop the piece about being open to Lucene's committers and others - a bit outdated.
We should also either include the other contribs, or change the wording to indicate that the list is only a sampling of the many contribs.
