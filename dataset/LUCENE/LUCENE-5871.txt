Summary:
Simplify or remove use of Version in IndexWriterConfig
Description:
IndexWriter currently uses Version from IndexWriterConfig to determine the semantics of close(). This is a trapdoor for users, as they often default to just sending Version.LUCENE_CURRENT since they don't understand what it will be used for. Instead, we should make the semantics of close a direction option in IWC.
