Summary:
IndexReader.clone can leave files open
Description:
I hit this in working on LUCENE-1516.
When not using compound file format, if you clone an IndexReader, then close the original, then close the clone, the stored fields files (_X.fdt, _X.fdx) remain incorrectly open.
I have a test showing it; fix is trivial. Will post patch & commit shortly.
