Summary:
(Point|LegacyNumeric)RangeQuery builders to match queries' (lower|upper)Term optionality logic
Description:
Currently the (Point|LegacyNumeric)RangeQuery queries themselves support (lower|upper)Term optionality e.g. the lowerTerm could be omitted but the (Point|LegacyNumeric)RangeQueryBuilder builders mandate (lower|upper)Term attributes. This mismatch seems unintended.
Proposed patch for ...QueryBuilder logic to match ...Query logic to follow.
