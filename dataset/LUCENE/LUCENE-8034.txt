Summary:
SpanNotWeight returns wrong results due to integer overflow
Description:
In SpanNotQuery, there is an acceptance condition:
if (candidate.endPosition() + post <= excludeSpans.startPosition()) {
    return AcceptStatus.YES;
}
This overflows in case `candidate.endPosition() + post > Integer.MAX_VALUE`. I have a fix for this which I am working on. Basically I am flipping the add to a subtract.
