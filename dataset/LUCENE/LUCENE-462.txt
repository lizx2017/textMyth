Summary:
bad normalization in sorted search returning TopDocs
Description:
FieldSortedHitQueue.maxscore is maintained in the lessThan method (which never gets called if a single document is added to the queue).
I've checked in a test to TestSort.testTopDocsScores() with the final assertion commented out.
