Summary:
Binary field content lost during optimize
Description:
Scenario:
create an index with arbitrary content, and close it
open IndexWriter again, and add a document with binary field (stored but not compressed)
close IndexWriter without optimizing, so that the new document is in a separate segment.
open IndexReader. You can read the last document and its binary field just fine.
open IndexWriter, optimize the index, close IndexWriter
open IndexReader. Now the field is still present (not null) and is marked as binary, but the data is not there - Field.getBinaryLength() returns 0.
