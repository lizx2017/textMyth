Summary:
SpatialArgsParser should let the context parse the shape string
Description:
SpatialArgsParser is not letting the SpatialContext read the shape string (via readShape(); instead it's using new SpatialArgsParser(ctx).readShape(...shapestring...). For the standard SpatialContext there is no difference. But the JTS extension has its own which parses WKT for polygon support, etc.
Quick fix of course but this really sucks if 4.0 won't have the ability to plug in alternative shapes.
