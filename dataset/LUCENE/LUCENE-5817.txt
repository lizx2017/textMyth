Summary:
hunspell buggy zero-affix handling
Description:
This only partially works today. But zero-affixes are used heavily by many dictionaries (e.g. i found a good number of bugs in czech and latvian just experimenting).
The fix is easy: we just have to look for "0" in the affix portion as well as the strip portion, as indicated by the manual page:
"Zero stripping or affix are indicated by zero."
