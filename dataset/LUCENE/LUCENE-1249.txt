Summary:
Bugs in org.apache.lucene.index.TermVectorsReader.clone()
Description:
A couple of things:
The implementation can return null which is not allowed. It should throw a CloneNotSupportedException if that's the case.
Part of the code reads:
TermVectorsReader clone = null;
try
{ clone = (TermVectorsReader) super.clone(); }
catch (CloneNotSupportedException e) {}
clone.tvx = (IndexInput) tvx.clone();
If a CloneNotSupportedException is caught then "clone" will be null and the assignment to clone.tvx will fail with a null pointer exception.
