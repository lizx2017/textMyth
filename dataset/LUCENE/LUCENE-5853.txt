Summary:
RamUsageEstimator has too general exception handlers
Description:
core util RamUsageEstimator has several handlers in which "Exception" was caught and ignored. Such a general handler not only includes reflection-related exceptions such as ClassNotFoundException, NoSuchFieldException and NoSuchMethodException (which are OK to be ignored) but also harmful exceptions (that should at least be logged), such as NullPointerException, UnsupportedOperationException, SecurityException, etc.
