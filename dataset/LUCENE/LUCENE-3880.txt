Summary:
UAX29URLEmailTokenizer fails to recognize emails as such when the mailto: scheme is prepended
Description:
As reported by Kai GÃ¼lzau on solr-user:
UAX29URLEmailTokenizer seems to split at the wrong place:
mailto:test@example.org
->
mailto:test
example.org
As a workaround I use
<charFilter class="solr.PatternReplaceCharFilterFactory" pattern="mailto:" replacement="mailto: "/>
