Summary:
IW commit without commit user-data changes should also be reflected in NRT reopen
Description:
In LUCENE-6505 we fixed NRT readers to properly reflect changes from
the last commit (new segments_N filename, new commit user-data), but I
missed the case where a commit is done immediately after opening an
NRT reader with no changes to the commit user-data.
