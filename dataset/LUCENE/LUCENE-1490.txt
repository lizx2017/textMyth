Summary:
CJKTokenizer convert HALFWIDTH_AND_FULLWIDTH_FORMS wrong
Description:
CJKTokenizer have these lines..
if (ub == Character.UnicodeBlock.HALFWIDTH_AND_FULLWIDTH_FORMS)
{ /** convert HALFWIDTH_AND_FULLWIDTH_FORMS to BASIC_LATIN */ int i = (int) c; i = i - 65248; c = (char) i; }

This is wrong. Some character in the block (e.g. U+ff68) have no BASIC_LATIN counterparts.
Only 65281-65374 can be converted this way.

The fix is

if (ub == Character.UnicodeBlock.HALFWIDTH_AND_FULLWIDTH_FORMS && i <= 65474 && i> 65281) { /** convert HALFWIDTH_AND_FULLWIDTH_FORMS to BASIC_LATIN */ int i = (int) c; i = i - 65248; c = (char) i; }
