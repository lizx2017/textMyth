Summary:
Unit tests do not fail if a ConcurrentMergeScheduler thread hits an exception
Description:
Now that CMS is the default, it's important to fail any unit test that
hits an exception in a CMS thread. But they do not fail now. The
preferred solution (thanks to Erik Hatcher) is to fix all Lucene unit
tests to subclass from a new LuceneTestCase (in o.a.l.util) base that
asserts that there were no such exceptions during the test.
