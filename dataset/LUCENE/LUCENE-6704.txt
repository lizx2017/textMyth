Summary:
GeoPointInBBox/Distance queries can throw OOME
Description:
After investigating LUCENE-6685 the performance issues and improvements related to GeoPointInBBox/Distance queries could be categorized into two separate issues:
1. OOME caused by an unnecessary number of ranges computed for Point Distance Queries (bug in the GeoPointTermEnum base class where the bounding box was used for intersections instead of the point radius)
2. API improvements providing configurable detail parameters.
This issue addresses 1. LUCENE-6685 will further investigate the need for 2 (after working 1 and correcting for unnecessary range detail, it looks like 2 may not be needed)
