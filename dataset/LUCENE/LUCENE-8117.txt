Summary:
advanceExact does not work on sorted numeric dvs with Lucene54DocValuesProducer
Description:
DocValues are iterators now so old doc values (produced with Lucene54DocValues) also implements advance and advanceExact. Though sorted numerics produced by Lucene54DocValues are not working as expected when advanceExact is used.
In such case, the docValueCount is as expected but the values returned by the iterator for the document are invalid. This is due to a bug in the implementation of advanceExact in the producer that does not set the offset of the current doc when the function is used.
