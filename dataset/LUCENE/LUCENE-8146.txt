Summary:
Unit tests using StringHelper fail with ExceptionInInitializerError for maven surefire >= 2.18
Description:
This happens when multiple conditions are met:
The client code is built with Maven
To execute its unit tests, the client code relies on the maven-surefire-plugin, with a version greater than 2.17 (last working version)
The client code uses the org.apache.lucene.util.StringHelper class (even transitively)
The client is configured as with the standard Lucene maven build (i.e. it is possible to fix the test seed using the tests.seed property)
There was a change in Surefire's behavior starting with 2.18: when a property is empty, instead of not sending it to the test runner, it will be sent with an empty value.
This behavior can be observed with the attached sample project:
mvn test: fails with a java.lang.ExceptionInInitializerError
mvn test -Dtests.seed=123456: succeeds because the property is set to a real value
mvn test -Dsurefire.version=2.17: succeeds because the surefire version is lower than 2.18
Attached is a patch (built against branch_7x) that centralizes accesses to the tests.seed system property; it also makes sure that if it is empty, it is treated as absent.
