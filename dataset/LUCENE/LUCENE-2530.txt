Summary:
rename docsEnum.getBulkResult() to make its role clearer
Description:
Before docsEnum.read() can be called a BulkResult instance must be allocated for it (it == the default implementation of that method).
This is done by calling docsEnum.getBulkResult(). Failure to call this method before read() is called results in a NullPointerException.
It is somewhat counterintuitive to "get" the results of an operation before calling said operation.
Maybe this method should be renamed to something more definite-sounding like obtainBulkResult() or prepareBulkResult() ?
