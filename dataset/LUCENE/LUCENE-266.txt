Summary:
German Analyzer does not handle search terms with asterisks
Description:
I created a test set of text files with special German characters in them and in
UTF-8 format, which I then indexed using GermanAnalyzer and an adapted Lucene
demo program - IndexFiles.java. But the QueryParser in the demo SearchFiles.java
always returns the search term containing the original German umlauts or sz
letters, whenever I use the wildcard asterisk. It does not replace the
umlauts and sz letters as I would expect it to do before performing a search.
Examples: Using the GermanAnalyzer, QueryParser returns these words in lower
case, but with the German umlaut letters unchanged in the parsed queries:
BÃ¼rger*, SchlÃ¼ssel*, WÃ¤hr*, StraÃ, herkÃ¶mm, stÃ¤dt, Ã, Ã, Ã*.
(When the above words appear with broken letters, here they are in ASCII format:
Buerger*, Schluessel*, Waehr*, Strasz*, herkoemm, staedt*, AE*, OE*, UE*).
This is leading to Lucene exceptions such as BooleanQuery.TooManyClauses in our
system that uses Lucene.
