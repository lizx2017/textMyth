Summary:
Jar manifest should not contain ${user.name} of the person building
Description:
Not sure if it is a big deal, but I don't particularly like that my user id for my build machine is in the manifest of the JAR that I constructed. It's a stretch, security-wise, I know, but I don't see how it serves any useful purpose. We have signatures/logs/SVN tags so we know who built the particular item w/o needing to know what their local user account name is.
The fix is:
