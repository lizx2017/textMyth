Summary:
Require minimum ivy version
Description:
Someone on solr-user ran into a problem while trying to run 'ant idea' so they could work on Solr in their IDE. Steve Rowe indicated that this is probably due to IVY-1194, requiring an ivy jar upgrade.
The build system should check for a minimum ivy version, just like it does with ant. The absolute minimum we require appears to be 2.2.0, but do we want to make it 2.3.0 due to IVY-1388?
I'm not sure how to go about checking the ivy version. Checking the ant version is easy because it's ant itself that does the checking.
There might be other component versions that should be checked too.
