Summary:
LRUQueryCache can leak locks
Description:
If a QueryCache is shared between two searchers, one of which has an IndexReader with no CacheHelper, then CachingWrapperWeight can leak locks in scorerSupplier() and bulkScorer(). This can cause the IndexReader that does have a CacheHelper to hang on close.
