Summary:
improve BaseTokenStreamTestCase to test end()
Description:
If offsetAtt/end() is not implemented correctly, then there can be problems with highlighting: see LUCENE-2207 for an example with CJKTokenizer.
In my opinion you currently have to write too much code to test this.
This patch does the following:
adds optional Integer finalOffset (can be null for no checking) to assertTokenStreamContents
in assertAnalyzesTo, automatically fill this with the String length()
In my opinion this is correct, for assertTokenStreamContents the behavior should be optional, it may not even have a Tokenizer. If you are using assertTokenStreamContents with a Tokenizer then simply provide the extra expected value to check it.
for assertAnalyzesTo then it is implied there is a tokenizer so it should be checked.
the tests pass for core but there are failures in contrib even besides CJKTokenizer (apply Koji's patch from LUCENE-2207, it is correct). Specifically ChineseTokenizer has a similar problem.
