Summary:
Lucene 1.3-rc1 does not build against JavaCC 3.0
Description:
The build.xml file contains "hard" references to JavaCC 2.0 (JavaCC.zip) to
perform a test, whether JavaCC is installed.
This test fails, when JavaCC 3.0 is being used (JavaCC 2.0 is not available from
the distribution site anymore).
ant 1.5.x has a bug (bug#19467) in the JavaCC task, which causes the task to
fail with JavaCC 3.0.
Please remove or adjust the "available" task in the "init" target to work with
JavaCC 3.0.
