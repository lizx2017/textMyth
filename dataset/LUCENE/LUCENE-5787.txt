Summary:
LuceneTestCase static leak checker interferes with Groovy unit tests
Description:
LuceneTestCase's static memory leak checker can break Groovy subclasses. Specifically, Groovy classes have a synthetic static member variable of type org.codehaus.groovy.reflection.ClassInfo. If this variable grows too large then LTC will fail the test. Because the variable is added by the Groovy runtime instead of by the developer there is no way for the developer to clear the field themselves.
Also note that the static leak checker does not ignore memory held by soft or weak references. These should be ignored because the memory retained by such fields will be reclaimed instead of triggering OutOfMemoryErrors.
Note that because LTC is a base class for Solr's testing support classes this also affects SolrTestCaseJ4 and AbstractSolrTestCase.
