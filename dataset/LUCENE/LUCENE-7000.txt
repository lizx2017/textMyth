Summary:
Split BasePointFormatTestCase from TestPointValues
Description:
TestPointValues has a bunch of tests for the indexwriter behavior... those should stay right where they are.
but it has other, more general tests and stress tests, which should go in test-framework, so we can test each codec implementation (Lucene60, SimpleText, Asserting at the moment).
