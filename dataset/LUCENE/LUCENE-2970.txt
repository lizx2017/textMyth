Summary:
SpecialOperations.isFinite can have TERRIBLE TERRIBLE runtime in certain situations
Description:
in an application of mine, i experienced some very slow query times with finite automata (all the DFAs are acyclic)
It turned out, the slowdown is some terrible runtime in SpecialOperations.isFinite <-- this is used to determine if the DFA is acyclic or not.
(in this case I am talking about even up to minutes of cpu).
