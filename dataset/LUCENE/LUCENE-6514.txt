Summary:
'ant idea' no longer includes code style settings
Description:
Fairly recently, with modern versions of IntelliJ (14+ ?), code style settings are no longer included when you run ant idea, so you get the defaults (4 spaces per indent level rather than 2, etc.)
The .idea/projectCodeStyle.xml file is still there, so something has changed.
