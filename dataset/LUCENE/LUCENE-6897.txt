Summary:
Fix maxRadius at pole for GeoPointDistanceQuery
Description:
At the moment GeoPointDistanceQuery throws and IllegalArgumentException if the distance exceeds the maximum radial distance on the earth's surface. At the pole, however, the radial distance should be no greater than the maximum meridian distance on the ellipsoid. This issue will correct the maximum radius check to handle center points at the poles.
