Summary:
Hitting disk full during DocumentWriter.ThreadState.init(...) can cause hang
Description:
More testing of RC2 ...
I found one case, if you hit disk full during init() in
DocumentsWriter.ThreadState, when we first create the term vectors &
fields writer, such that subsequent calls to
IndexWriter.add/updateDocument will then hang forever.
What's happening in this case is we are incrementing nextDocID even
though we never call finishDocument (because we "thought" init did not
succeed). Then, when we finish the next document, it will never
actually write because missing finishDocument call never happens.
