/mnt/ssd/jenkins/workspace/Lucene-Solr-trunk-Linux/lucene/common-build.xml:2293: Parsing signatures failed: No method found with following signature: java.util.jar.Pack200$Packer#addPropertyChangeListener(java.beans.PropertyChangeListener)
This is a really new thing:
The method java.util.jar.Pack200$Packer#addPropertyChangeListener(java.beans.PropertyChangeListener) part of the JDK 8 deprecation list. But this method was actually removed in Java 9 completely (the first deprecation ever that was actually removed!). This method was deprecated in Java 8 for the first time, with the following text:
"Deprecated. The dependency on PropertyChangeListener creates a significant impediment to future modularization of the Java platform. This method will be removed in a future release. Applications that need to monitor progress of the packer can poll the value of the PROGRESS property instead."
So I am not sure how to handle that, it seems that in JDK9, Oracle may need to remove more deprecated stuff to make modularization possible. In branch_5x builds this is not a problem, because it was not deprecated in Java 8, so the java 7 signatures file does not have that method listed. A workaround would be to enable the forbidden feature to not fail on missing signatures.
