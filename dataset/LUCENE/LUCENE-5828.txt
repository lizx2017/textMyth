Summary:
Improve BufferedIndexInput.SlicedIndexInput to directly delegate
Description:
Currently we have some IndexInputs which do not have a separate slice() implementation. Those are using BufferedIndexInput#wrap(), which extends BufferedInputStream. This is nonsense, because the underlying IndexInput is in most cases already Buffered, and if not, its not needed.
This issue will change SlicedIndexInput to directly delegate, correcting offsets. The new class SlicedIndexInput will be top level and public.
