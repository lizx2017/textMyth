Summary:
AnalyzingInfixSuggester doesn't support Phrase Queries for contexts
Description:
AnalyzingInfixSuggester uses Term Queries for filtering out the contexts. If the StandardAnalyzer is used while indexing , since all the contexts are stored as StringField and analyzed , spaces in them are removed and words converted to tokens. So contexts having spaces in their terms can't be queried , And we also can't pass a PhraseQuery as a BooleanQuery to lookup() since Phrase Queries won't work on string fields where positions of tokens are not stored.
Option left is to use a different analyzer while indexing
Analyzing Infix Suggester should store contexts as TextField instead of StringField so they can be queried.
