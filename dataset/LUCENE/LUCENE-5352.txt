Summary:
PackedInts.fastestFormatAndBits returns slower format for Direct
Description:
from some simple testing, DirectPacked64SingleBlockReader seems slower than DirectPackedReader (at least in a few cases i tested, more testing needed, but look at the code).
this is unintuitive, because by passing e.g. FASTER you are making it slower.
