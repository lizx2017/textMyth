Summary:
Regular expression syntax with MultiFieldQueryParser causes assert/NPE
Description:
Using regex syntax causes MultiFieldQueryParser.parse() to throw an AssertionError (if asserts are on) or causes subsequent searches using the returned Query instance to throw NullPointerException (if asserts are off). Simon Willnauer's comment on the java-user alias: "This is in-fact a bug in the MultiFieldQueryParser [...] MultifieldQueryParser should override getRegexpQuery but it doesn't"
