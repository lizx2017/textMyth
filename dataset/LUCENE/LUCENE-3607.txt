Summary:
Lucene Index files can not be reproduced faithfully (due to timestamps embedded)
Description:
Eclipse 3.7 uses Lucene 2.9.1 for indexing online help content. A pre-generated help index can be shipped together with online content. As per
[https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=364979]
it turns out that the help index can not be faithfully reproduced during a build, because there are timestamps embedded in the index files, and the "NameCounter" field in segments_2 contains different contents on every build.
Not being able to faithfully reproduce the index from identical source bits undermines trust in the index (and software delivery) being correct.
I'm wondering whether this is a known issue and/or has been addressed in a newer Lucene version already ?
