Summary:
The class from cotrub directory org.apache.lucene.index.IndexSplitter creates a non correct index
Description:
When using the method IndexSplitter.split(File destDir, String[] segs) from the Lucene cotrib directory (contrib/misc/src/java/org/apache/lucene/index) it creates an index with segments descriptor file with wrong data. Namely wrong is the number representing the name of segment that would be created next in this index.
If some of the segments of the index already has this name this results either to impossibility to create new segment or in crating of an corrupted segment.
