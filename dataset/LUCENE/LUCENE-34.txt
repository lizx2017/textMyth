Summary:
e-mail token in StandardTokenizer.jj does not match valid e-mail addresses
Description:
E-mail token in StandardTokenizer.jj does not match many valid e-mail
addresses. See line 106:
<EMAIL: <ALPHANUM> "@" <ALPHANUM> ("." <ALPHANUM>)+ >
For example, neither danson@germane-software.com (because of the dash) nor
dale.anson@germane-software.com (because of the first dot and the dash) match.
the following is slightly better, but does not come close to meeting the
specifications of RFC 822:
<EMAIL: <ALPHANUM> ("."|"" <ALPHANUM>)+ "@" <ALPHANUM> ("."|"" <ALPHANUM>)+
>
This is being reported against the May 11 nightly build (I compiled from
source using the supplied Ant build file on RedHat Linux 7.2, jikes, javacc
2.0, and Sun Linux JDK 1.4), however, I originally ran across this problem in
Lucene 1.2 rc4.
