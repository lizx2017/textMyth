Summary:
Delete failed after new Term is indexed
Description:
Deleting documents from a reader has no permanent effect if the reader is
opened before a writer is used to index new documents. This is similar to bug
6140 (http://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=6140) reported before,
although I donâ€™t think it is a multi-thread issue. The following pseudo-code
caused the problem:
reader.open()
writer.open()
writer.add(documentB)
writer.close()
reader.delete(documentA)
reader.close()
searcher.open()
searcher.search("term_common_to_docA_and_docB")
// This returns both docA and docB
Please see my attached test class, which is single threaded. I believe the
option (a) and (b) suggested in BUG 6140 are valid, but not necessary (C).
