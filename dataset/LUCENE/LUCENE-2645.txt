Summary:
False assertion of >0 position delta in StandardPostingsWriterImpl
Description:
StandardPostingsWriterImpl line 159 is:
    assert delta > 0 || position == 0 || position == -1: "position=" + position + " lastPosition=" + lastPosition;            // not quite right (if pos=0 is repeated twice we don't catch it)
I enable assertions when I run my unit tests and I've found this assertion to fail when delta is 0 which occurs when the same position value is sent in twice in arrow. Once I added RemoveDuplicatesTokenFilter, this problem went away. Should I really be forced to add this filter? I think delta >= 0 would be a better assertion.
