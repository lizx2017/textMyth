Summary:
Test execution can hang with java.security.debug
Description:
As reported by Robert:
# clone trunk
cd lucene/core/
ant test -Dargs="-Djava.security.debug=access:failure" -Dtestcase=TestDemo
Hangs the test runner. The same problem appears to be present in ES builds too. It seems like some kind of weird stream buffer problem, the security framework seems to be writing to the native descriptors directly. Will have to dig (deep...).
