Summary:
Russian Analyzer assumes default encoding is iso-8859-1
Description:
On OSX, the default encoding is MacRoman, so this causes TestRussianAnalyzer to fail, since the
file is not read in correctly.
The correct solution is to explicitly specify that the test file should be read using iso-8859-1
encoding. I've attached a patch.
