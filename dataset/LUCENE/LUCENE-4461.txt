Summary:
Multiple FacetRequest with the same path creates inconsistent results
Description:
Multiple FacetRequest are getting merged into one creating wrong results in this case:
FacetSearchParams facetSearchParams = new FacetSearchParams();
facetSearchParams.addFacetRequest(new CountFacetRequest(new CategoryPath("author"), 10));
facetSearchParams.addFacetRequest(new CountFacetRequest(new CategoryPath("author"), 10));
Problem can be fixed by defining hashcode and equals in certain way that Lucene recognize we are talking about different requests.
Attached test case.
