Summary:
Lucene60PointsWriter has a buggy close method
Description:
This will leak a file handle on e.g. disk full or other exceptions
  @Override
  public void close() throws IOException {
    if (closed == false) {
      CodecUtil.writeFooter(dataOut); // something bad happens
      dataOut.close();
I'm not a fan of these complex close methods, should we add a finish() to the codec api or similar?
