Summary:
CompressingStoredFieldsFormat should reclaim memory more aggressively
Description:
When stored fields are configured with BEST_COMPRESSION, we rely on garbage collection to reclaim Deflater/Inflater instances. However these classes use little JVM memory but may use significant native memory, so if may happen that the OS runs out of native memory before the JVM collects these unreachable Deflater/Inflater instances. We should look into reclaiming native memory more aggressively.
