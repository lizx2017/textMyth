Summary:
Lucene should not call System.out.println
Description:
We seem to have accumulated a few random sops...
Eg, PairOutputs.java (oal.util.fst) and MultiDocValues.java, at least.
Can we somehow detect (eg, have a test failure) if we accidentally leave errant System.out.println's (leftover from debugging)...?
