Summary:
When building source distribution, changes-to-html uses wrong script and wrong CHANGES.txt
Description:
From #lucene-dev IRC
when it builds the src.tgz files
it (i have no idea why) uses the pl script from inside the svn-export on the CHANGES.txt next to build.xml
...
it uses CWD changes.txt
and executes it against the script inside the export dir
