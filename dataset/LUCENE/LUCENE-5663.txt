Summary:
Fix FSDirectory.open API
Description:
Spinoff from LUCENE-5658
This does not use NIOFSDir! open() is a static factory method on FSDirectory, just inherited to NIOFSDirectory.
I think its confusing we have this method on FSDirectory, so its visible in subclasses. We should at least consider doing this in another way so its not confusing.
