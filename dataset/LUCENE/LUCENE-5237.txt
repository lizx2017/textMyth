Summary:
StemmerUtil.deleteN may delete too many characters
Description:
StemmerUtil.deleteN calls to delete(), but in some cases, it may delete too many characters. E.g. if you execute this code:
char[] buf = "abcd".toCharArray();
int len = StemmerUtil.deleteN(buf, buf.length, buf.length, 3);
System.out.println(new String(buf, 0, len));
You get "a", even though no character should have been deleted (not according to the javadocs nor common logic).
The problem is in delete(), which always returns len-1, even if no character is actually deleted.
I'll post a patch that fixes it shortly.
