Summary:
Move back compat codecs out of core/ into codecs/ jar
Description:
These take significant space and bloat core lucene. Not everyone needs the ability to read ancient indexes (especially building a new app).
We should move this cruft out of the core/ jar. codecs/ is the obvious place, its already setup in the build system for tests and everything else.
