Summary:
Instantiated/IndexWriter discrepanies
Description:
RAMDirectory seems to do a reset on tokenStreams the first time, this permits to initialise some objects before starting streaming, InstantiatedIndex does not.
I can Serialize a RAMDirectory but I cannot on a InstantiatedIndex because of : java.io.NotSerializableException: org.apache.lucene.index.TermVectorOffsetInfo
