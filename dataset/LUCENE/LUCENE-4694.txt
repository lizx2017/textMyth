Summary:
Add back IndexReader.fields() -> Multi*, or discourage term vectors in some better way
Description:
Users can easily get term vectors from any indexreader, but not postings lists. this encourages them to do really slow things: like pulling term vectors for every single document.
this is really really so much worse than going through multifields or whatever.
