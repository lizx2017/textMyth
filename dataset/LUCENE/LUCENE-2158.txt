Summary:
NRT can temporarily lose deletions at high indexing rates
Description:
OK, I found a sneaky case where NRT can temporarily lose deletions.
The deletions aren't permanently lost - they are seen on the next
opened NRT reader.
It happens like this (in IW.getReader):
First flush() is called, to flush added docs & materialize the
deletes.
The very next statement enters a sync'd block to open the reader,
but, if indexing rate is very high, and threads get scheduled
"appropriately", a "natural" flush (due to RAM buffer being full
or flush doc count being reached) could be hit before the sync
block is entered, in which case that 2nd flush won't materialize
the deletes associated with it, and the returned NRT reader will
only see its adds until it's next reopened.
The fix is simple â€“ we should materialize deletes inside the sync
block, not during the flush.
