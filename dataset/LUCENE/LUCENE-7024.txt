Summary:
smokeTestRelease.py's maven checker needs to switch from svn to git
Description:
The checkMaven function in the smoke tester seems to be loading known branches from SVN to locate the branch currently being released and then crawling for pom.xml.template files from the svn server. We need to switch this to crawling git instead, but I'm not too familiar with what's happening here ...
Maybe Steve Rowe can help?
