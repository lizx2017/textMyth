Summary:
FastVectorHighlihgter fails with SIOOB if single phrase or term is > fragCharSize
Description:
This has been reported on several occasions like SOLR-4660 / SOLR-4137 or on the ES mailing list https://groups.google.com/d/msg/elasticsearch/IdyMSPK5gao/nKZq8_NYWmgJ
The reason is that the current code expects the fragCharSize > matchLength which is not necessarily true if you use phrases or if you have very long terms like URLs or so. I have a test that reproduces the issue and a fix as far as I can tell (me doesn't have much experience with the highlighter.
