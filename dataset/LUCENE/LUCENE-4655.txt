Summary:
Documentation of the StandardTokenizerInterface getNextToken() return value
Description:
Documentation of getNextToken() says that it returns an int, but incorrectly states that it returns the next token. getNextToken doesn't return the next token, it returns the numerical type of the next token that was found, as defined by constants in the implementing class. That is also useful information that can be taken advantage of in the filtering chain that follows.
