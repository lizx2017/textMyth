Summary:
filter eclipse-build from eclipse file search
Description:
When doing a file search in the eclipse project built with "ant eclipse", the eclipse-build directory gets searched. This results in about twice as many files being searched, so it takes about twice as long as it should. I would expect eclipse to automatically skip that directory because it knows that directory is its own build target, but it doesn't seem that eclipse is that smart.
