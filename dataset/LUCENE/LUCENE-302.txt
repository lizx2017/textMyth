Summary:
org.apache.lucene.index.IndexReader and org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter cann't be used at the same time.
Description:
It will create Lock error exception, which sounds some sense.
But as a lucene plug-in into application server environment, user likes to leave
the IndexWriter and IndexReader be persistent as being created at server startup
stage, because it seems that first operation on instance of either reader or
writer is pretty expensive [around 1 second on my machine], but the following
ones are super fast, aorund 5 millisecond or so.
