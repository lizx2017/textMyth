Summary:
StraightBytesDocValuesField fails if bytes > 32k
Description:
I didn't observe any limitations on the size of a bytes based DocValues field value in the docs. It appears that the limit is 32k, although I didn't get any friendly error telling me that was the limit. 32k is kind of small IMO; I suspect this limit is unintended and as such is a bug. The following test fails:
  public void testBigDocValue() throws IOException {
    Directory dir = newDirectory();
    IndexWriter writer = new IndexWriter(dir, writerConfig(false));

    Document doc = new Document();
    BytesRef bytes = new BytesRef((4+4)*4097);//4096 works
    bytes.length = bytes.bytes.length;//byte data doesn't matter
    doc.add(new StraightBytesDocValuesField("dvField", bytes));
    writer.addDocument(doc);
    writer.commit();
    writer.close();

    DirectoryReader reader = DirectoryReader.open(dir);
    DocValues docValues = MultiDocValues.getDocValues(reader, "dvField");
    //FAILS IF BYTES IS BIG!
    docValues.getSource().getBytes(0, bytes);

    reader.close();
    dir.close();
  }
