Summary:
SimpleFSLockFactory should catch+box IOException (not FileAlreadyExistsException | AccessDeniedException)
Description:
SimpleFSLockFactory will only convert FileAlreadyExistsException | AccessDeniedException from Files.createFile() into LockObtainFailedException. Neither of these are guaranteed from the API, only IOException.
I think SimpleFSLockFactory should box any IOException from Files.createFile() into a LockObtainFailedException instead of just these two optional ones. It is simpler and more consistent behavior, even if its just theoretical problem for some FileSystem impl that doesn't throw these.
