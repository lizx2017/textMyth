Summary:
ToParentBlockJoinCollector provides no way to access computed scores and the maxScore
Description:
The constructor of ToParentBlockJoinCollector allows to turn on the tracking of parent scores and the maximum parent score, however there is no way to access those scores because:
maxScore is a private field, and there is no getter
TopGroups / GroupDocs does not provide access to the scores for the parent documents, only the children
