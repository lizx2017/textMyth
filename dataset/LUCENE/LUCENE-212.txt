Summary:
FileInputStream never closed in HTMLParser
Description:
HTMLParser.java contains this code:
public HTMLParser(File file) throws FileNotFoundException
{ this(new FileInputStream(file)); }
This FileInputStream should be closed with the close() method, as there's no
guarantee that the garbage collection will run and do this for you. I don't
know how to fix this without changing the API to take a FileInputStream
instead of a File, as the call to this() must be the first thing in the
constructor, i.e. you cannot create the stream, call this(...), and then close
the stream.
