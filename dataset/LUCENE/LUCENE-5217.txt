Summary:
disable transitive dependencies in maven config
Description:
Our ivy configuration does this: each dependency is specified and so we know what will happen. Unfortunately the maven setup is not configured the same way.
Instead the maven setup is configured to download the internet: and it excludes certain things specifically.
This is really hard to configure and maintain: we added a 'validate-maven-dependencies' that tries to fail on any extra jars, but all it really does is run a license check after maven "runs". It wouldnt find unnecessary dependencies being dragged in if something else in lucene was using them and thus they had a license file.
Since maven supports wildcard exclusions: MNG-3832, we can disable this transitive shit completely.
We should do this, so its configuration is the exact parallel of ivy.
