Summary:
PerField(DocValues|Postings)Format do not call the per-field merge methods
Description:
While porting some old codec code from Lucene 4.3.1, I couldn't get the per-field formats to call upon the per-field merge methods; the default merge method was always being called.
I think this is a side-effect of LUCENE-5894.
Attached is a patch with a test that reproduces the error and an associated fix that pass the unit tests.
