Summary:
Spellchecker don't find suggestion for concrete misspelled 6 letter words
Description:
Debugging Solr spellchecker (IndexBasedSpellchecker, delegating on lucene Spellchecker) behaviour i think i found a bug when the input is a 6 letter word:
george
anthem
argued
fluent
Due to the getMin() and getMax() the grams indexed for these terms are 3 and 4. So, the fields would be something like this:
for "george"
start3: "geo"
start4: "geor"
end3: "rge"
end4: "orge"
3: "geo", "eor", "org", "rge"
4: "geor", "eorg", "orge"
for "anthem"
start3: "ant"
start4: "anth"
end3: "tem"
end4: "them"
The problem shows up when the user swap 3rd a 4th characters, misspelling the word like this:
geroge
anhtem
The queries generated for this terms are: (SHOULD boolean queries)
for "geroge"
start3: "ger"
start4: "gero"
end3: "oge"
end4: "roge"
3: "ger", "ero", "rog", "oge"
4: "gero", "erog", "roge"
for "anhtem"
start3: "anh"
start4: "anht"
end3: "tem"
end4: "htem"
3: "anh", "nht", "hte", "tem"
4: "anht", "nhte", "htem"
So, as you can see, this kind of misspelling never matches the suitable suggestions although the edit distance is 0.95555556.
I think getMin(int l) and getMax(int l) should return 2 and 3, respectively, for l==6. Debugging other values i did not found any problem with any kind of misspelling.
