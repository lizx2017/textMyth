Summary:
idf(t) is not actually squared during scoring?
Description:
The javadocs for Similarity:
http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_4_0/api/org/apache/lucene/search/Similarity.html
show idf(t) as being squared when computing net query score. But I
don't think it is actually squared, in looking at the sources? Maybe
it used to be, eg this interesting discussion:
http://markmail.org/message/k5pl7scmiac5wosb
Or am I missing something? We just need to fix the javadocs to take
away the "squared"...
