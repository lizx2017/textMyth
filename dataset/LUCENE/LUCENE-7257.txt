Summary:
PointValues aggregated stats fail if the provided field does not have points on one of the leaves
Description:
The static helpers on PointValues to get aggregated size/docCount/minPackedValue/maxPackedValue fail if a leaf has points indexed (so that getPointValues() returns a non-null value) but not for the given field. In that case PointValues.size() throws an exception.
