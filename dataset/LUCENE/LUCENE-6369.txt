Summary:
Make queries more defensive and clone deeply
Description:
It is very important for the query cache that queries be either immutable or clone deeply so that they cannot change after having been put into the cache.
There are three issues that need to be addressed:
mutable queries such as boolean or phrase queries do not clone deeply
queries that wrap mutable objects such as TermQuery's term
filters inherit Query's default clone impl which is not enough in most cases
