Summary:
Improve MockDirectoryWrapper byte size tracking
Description:
Test failure and start of discussion at http://markmail.org/message/tyxxmg5blrczvqx3.
The problem is that MockDirectoryWrapper only checks for disk full errors in writeByte(s) although with RAMDirectory, some bytes only get accounted upon flush and seek (see MockDirectoryWrapper.getRecomputedActualSizeInBytes and call sites of RAMOutputStream.setFileLength).
