Summary:
Update Clover dependency and License to allow processing Java 7 source code
Description:
We moved to Java 7 in LUCENE-4747. But Clover 2.6.3 only allows Java 6. We should upgrade clover to the latest version (at least in trunk) and make "ant run-clover" work again. We have to replace the ASF License File with a new one for this to work.
