Summary:
trunk 'ant test' hangs
Description:
Running 'ant test' from trunk on XP in a Cygwin shell hangs.
There was no progress in the console for a long time, so i stopped the program.
Before stopping it, created 5 consecutive thread dumps to see where the code is.
It is not clear what is going on - does not seem like a Lucene code I think but not sure.
Opening this issue to keep an eye on this - I will try with other JDKs to see if this is persistent.
Also, when first seeing this had local changes of two issue: LUCENE-2986 and LUCENE-2977 - I think the changes in these issues are related but will repeat the tests without these changes.
