Summary:
Solr core Maven POM should include a dependency on wstx-asl stax parser
Description:
A new test introduced in SOLR-2630 (o.a.s.handler.XsltUpdateRequestHandlerTest) triggered a failure in the Maven build on Jenkins:
Stack Trace:
java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: Cannot create XMLStreamReader or XMLEventReader from a javax.xml.transform.dom.DOMSource

On #lucene IRC, Uwe said:
the problem was that the xsltupdatehandler relies on WSTX features
so the java6-shipped Stax does not support dom inputs
and in trunk the WSTX dependency was removed from solrj
but correct would be a dependency from core -> wstx
to compile wstx is not needed,
but for actually executing the code in tests or for solr's war,
wstx is needed because of its features, the java-shipped parser has not
