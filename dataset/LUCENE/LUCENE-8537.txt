Summary:
ant test command fails under lucene/tools
Description:
The ant test command executed under lucene/tools folder fails because it does not have junit.classpath property. Since the module does not have any test folder we could override the -test and -check-totals targets.
bash-3.2$ pwd
/Users/peter.somogyi/repos/lucene-solr/lucene/tools
bash-3.2$ ant test
Buildfile: /Users/peter.somogyi/repos/lucene-solr/lucene/tools/build.xml
...
-test:
   [junit4] <JUnit4> says ciao! Master seed: 9A2ACC9B4A3C8553

BUILD FAILED
/Users/peter.somogyi/repos/lucene-solr/lucene/common-build.xml:1567: The following error occurred while executing this line:
/Users/peter.somogyi/repos/lucene-solr/lucene/common-build.xml:1092: Reference junit.classpath not found.

I ran into this issue when uploaded a patch where I removed an import from this module. This triggered a module-level build during precommit that failed with this error.
