Summary:
CommonTermsQuery HighFreq MUST not applied if lowFreq terms
Description:
When a CommonTermsQuery has high and low frequency terms, the highFreq terms Boolean query is always added as a SHOULD clause, even if highFreqOccur is set to MUST:
new CommonTermsQuery(Occur.MUST, Occur.MUST,0.1);
My patch sets the top level Boolean query's minimum should match to 1 to ensure that the SHOULD clause must match. Not sure if this is the correct approach, or if it should just add the highFreq query as a MUST clause instead?
