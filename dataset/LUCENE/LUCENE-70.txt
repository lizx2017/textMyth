Summary:
QueryParser incorrectly escapes special characters in term names
Description:
Related to bug 11636
Sample:
build a document with a field named "Some-Term", whose value is Text "value".
The query Some-Term:value is parsed as "Some -Term:value", which is arguably
correct.
The query Some-Term:value is parsed as "Some-Term:value", which appears
incorrect. It returns no hits.
The query "Some-Term:value" appears to be parsed as "Some-Term:value" (according
to Query.toString()) but returns no hits.
