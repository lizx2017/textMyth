Summary:
two unused variables in analysis/stempel/src/java/org/egothor/stemmer/Compile.java
Description:
Compile.java
public static void main(java.lang.String[] args) throws Exception {
...
  for (int i = 1; i < args.length; i++) {
      // System.out.println("[" + args[i] + "]");
      Diff diff = new Diff();
      int stems = 0;
      int words = 0;
...
In the file Compile.java, the variables stems and words are unused.
Although words gets incremented further in the file, it does not get referenced or used elsewhere.
stems is neither incremented nor used elsewhere in the project.
Are these variables redundant?
