Summary:
FuzzyQuery: matching terms must be longer than maxEdits
Description:
FuzzyQuery's maxEdit value must be larger than the length of both terms for there to be a match. Based on a response from the java-user list, it looks like I wasn't the only one surprised by this. Let's document this design choice more clearly in the documentation or modify the behavior.
Apologies if I missed the documentation of this.
