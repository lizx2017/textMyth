Summary:
clean up lucene-test-framework dependencies
Description:
The current ivy configuration leads to the (wrong) belief that lucene-test-framework depends on junit4-ant and ant itself.
It confuses e.g. 'ant eclipse' (look and you will see those jars in classpath), and lists these as dependencies in published maven poms, etc.
But it really does not depend on junit4-ant at all, it works fine with other test runners (e.g. IDE runners). That is our build itself, and for it to taskdef the task, it can just use an ivy inline cachepath.
