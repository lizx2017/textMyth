Summary:
NativeFSLock.close() can invalidate other locks
Description:
the lock API in Lucene is super trappy since the lock that we return form this API must first be obtained and if we can't obtain it the lock should not be closed since we might ie. close the underlying channel in the NativeLock case which releases all lock for this file on some operating systems. I think the makeLock method should try to obtain and only return a lock if we successfully obtained it. Not sure if it's possible everywhere but we should at least make the documentation clear here.
