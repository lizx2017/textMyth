Summary:
speed up javadocs generation tasks
Description:
These generate the same things over and over. I think this is due to javadocs always rebuilding their dependencies.
Can we not add a fake timestamp file (with 'touch') somewhere like javadocs.generated and then use 'uptodate' comparing that against the relevant source code to determine if javadocs need regeneration?
This seems like it would be a very simple solution.
