Summary:
Regex bug in AnalyzingQueryParser
Description:
Dennis Walter recently pointed out this bug on dev@lucene.apache.org:
" // gobble escaped chars or find a wildcard character
private final Pattern wildcardPattern = Pattern.compile("(
.)|([?*]+)");
The first group will match a literal dot ("."), while its intention seems to be to match a backslash and a single character. So the expression should instead be "(\\\\.)|([?*]+)" "
