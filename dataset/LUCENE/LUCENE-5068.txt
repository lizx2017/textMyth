Summary:
QueryParserUtil.escape() does not escape forward slash
Description:
QueryParserUtil.escape() and QueryParser.escape() have different implementations. Most important, the former omit escaping forward slash ("/"). This again caused errors in the queryparser when a query ended with forward slash.
