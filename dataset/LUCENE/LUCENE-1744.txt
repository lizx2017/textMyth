Summary:
BooleanScorer2 fails to update this.doc when its the top scorer
Description:
When BooleanScorer2 runs the top collection loop (one of its
score(Collector)) methods, it uses a local "doc" var, ie:
public void score(Collector collector) throws IOException {
    collector.setScorer(this);
    int doc;
    while ((doc = countingSumScorer.nextDoc()) != NO_MORE_DOCS) {
      collector.collect(doc);
    }
}
The problem is, if the child collector calls scorer.doc() it will
always get -1. Most Collectors don't actually call scorer.doc(), but
one important one that does is ScoreCachingWrapperScorer, as it uses
the doc to know when to invalidate its cache. Since this always
returns -1, the ScoreCachingWrapperScorer keeps returning score=0.0 to
its caller, thus messing up a SortField.SCORE comparator instance if
it's included in the sort fields.
