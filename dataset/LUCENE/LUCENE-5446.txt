Summary:
ExtractWikipedia produces "null" strings
Description:
The ExtractWikipedia program produces null strings as output.
This is because Document.get() is only checking against StoredFields, but the extracted fields are set as not stored, e.g. DocMaker.setConfig.
I am not sure what the correct fix should be.
