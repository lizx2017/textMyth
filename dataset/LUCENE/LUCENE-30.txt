Summary:
Field.isIndexed() returns false for UnStored fields
Description:
I run a loop on documents to discover what fields are searchable.
UnStored fields return false when I call isIndexed(). Converting these
fields to Text fields in the indexer corrects the problems.
Obviously, using Text fields is a workaround, but I think the behaviour is
incorrect.
I've reproduced the issue on MacOS X and Linux. I'm using rc4.
