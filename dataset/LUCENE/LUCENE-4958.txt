Summary:
unnecessary assert on docid
Description:
In DocFieldProcessor, on line 353, there is this assert:
assert docValuesConsumerAndDocID.docID < docState.docID;
Is this assert necessary? I don't see in the indexing pipeline that this guarantee is needed. Can we remove this?
We have implemented a custom indexingchain that rewrites docState.docID is reverse order and it is working well. But we have to do ugly workarounds in our test to avoid this assert.
