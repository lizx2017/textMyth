Summary:
Constants#LUCENE_MAIN_VERSION can have broken values
Description:
Constants#LUCENE_MAIN_VERSION is set to the Lucene Main version and should not contain minor versions. Well this is at least what I thought and to my knowledge what the comments say too. Yet in for instance 4.3.1 and 4.5.1 we broke this such that the version from SegmentsInfo can not be parsed with Version#parseLeniently. IMO we should really add an assertion that this constant doesn't throw an error and / or make the smoketester catch this. to me this is actually a index BWC break. Note that 4.8.1 doesn't have this problem...
