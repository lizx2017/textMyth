Summary:
Regression from 6.x version on search with wildcard
Description:
Hello,
let say I index documents with attribute name like: prefixFileName
and that I search with "prefixF*", it is not found.
while searching with "prefix*" it works.
In 6.x (and 5.x) "prefixF*" was finding the value.
I've provided a test case
https://gist.github.com/benoitf/6078a0a8925826d8c89916a78a883cb0
and a pom.xml file
https://gist.github.com/benoitf/fefaf174fa4d96c40318dc4d044495b1
when setting property version in pom.xml to 6.6.2 it works
