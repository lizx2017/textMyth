Summary:
remove 'Changes to Backwards Compatibility Policy' from lucene/CHANGES.txt
Description:
CHANGES.txt is useful to summarize the changes in a release.
However its expected that a lot of changes will impact the APIs, this currently hurts the quality of CHANGES.txt because it leads to a significant portion of changes (whether they be bugs, features, whatever) being grouped under this one title.
It also leads to descriptions of CHANGES being unnecessarily verbose.
I think it makes CHANGES confusing and overwhelming, and it would be better to have a simpler 'upgrading' section with practical information on what you actually need to do (like Solr's CHANGES.txt).
