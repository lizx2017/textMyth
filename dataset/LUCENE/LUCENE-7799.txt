Summary:
Classic query parser should allow autoGeneratePhraseQueries=true when splitOnWhitespace=false
Description:
LUCENE-7533 disabled the option combination splitOnWhitespace=false/autoGeneratePhraseQueries=true because of how autoGeneratePhraseQueries=true is handled: a query chunk is treated as if it were literally quoted. When splitOnWhitespace=false, a query chunk can be multiple whitespace-separated words, and auto-quoting multiple terms will produce inappropriate phrase queries.
I have an idea about how to fix this: autoGeneratePhraseQueries=true is supposed to cause phrase queries to be constructed when multiple analyzed terms result from a single query word, e.g. when WordDelimiter(Graph)Filter splits words up. Maybe this could be re-implemented in terms of offsets, since all terms from the same original term share the same offsets.
