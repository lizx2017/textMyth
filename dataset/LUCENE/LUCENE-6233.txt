Summary:
CheckIndex is dog slow when checking term vectors
Description:
I'm working on a test that creates a biggish index and I noticed the CheckIndex takes a surprisingly long time to check term vectors.
I profiled it and uncovered that we spend a lot of time (not sure this explains all of it) in Terms.getMin/getMax. Since CompressingTermVectorsReader doesn't impl these methods efficiently (which is fine), we fallback to super's impl, which does a digit-by-digit binary search using seekCeil.
But for TVs this sometimes results in a linear scan.
I think CheckIndex should not check Terms.getMin/Max for TVs?
