Summary:
IndexSearcher.search is broken when IndexSearcher.executor != null and the sort contains SortField.FIELD_SCORE
Description:
When executor != null, IndexSearcher performs two passes to compute the top docs. This doesn't work when the sort contains SortField.FIELD_SCORE because the second pass doesn't have access to scores computed in the first pass. Since search(...) doesn't compute scores when there is a sort, they are all Float.NaN.
