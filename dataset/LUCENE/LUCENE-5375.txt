Summary:
ToChildBlockJoinQuery becomes crazy on wrong subquery
Description:
If user supplies wrong subquery to ToParentBlockJoinQuery it reasonably throws IllegalStateException. (http://lucene.apache.org/core/4_0_0/join/org/apache/lucene/search/join/ToParentBlockJoinQuery.html 'The child documents must be orthogonal to the parent documents: the wrapped child query must never return a parent document.'). However ToChildBlockJoinQuery just goes crazy silently. I want to provide simple patch for ToChildBlockJoinQuery with if-throw clause and test.
