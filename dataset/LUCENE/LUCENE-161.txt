Summary:
[PATCH] Query parser doesn't handle escaped field names
Description:
The QueryParser class does not handle escaped characters in field names. I
have a field named "/message[@type]" (which I can search on successfully using
a TermQuery). However, if I send this to the query parser -
"/message[@type]:message", it doesn't unescape the field name.
