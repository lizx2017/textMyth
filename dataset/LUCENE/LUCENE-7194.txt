Summary:
Ban Math.toRadians/toDegrees and remove all usages of it
Description:
The result of these methods is unreliable and changes across jvm versions: we cannot use these methods.
The following program prints 0.7722082215479366 on previous versions of java but 0.7722082215479367 on java 9 because Math.toRadians is no longer doing the same thing:
public class test {
  public static void main(String args[]) throws Exception {
    System.out.println(Math.toRadians(44.244272));
  }
}
This is because of https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-4477961.
I am not really sure its a bug, because the method says that the conversion is "generally inexact".
