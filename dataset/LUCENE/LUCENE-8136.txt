Summary:
Planes constructed with two points are wrong when points are close
Description:
Whenever a plane is constructed with two points (and the center of the planet), and those points are close to each other,it might happen that the final plane does not contain all points used for the construction. The issue seems to happen when the resulting magnitude of the normal vector of the new plane (calculated using cross product) is lower that 1e-5.
This is a follow up of issue LUCENE-8133.
