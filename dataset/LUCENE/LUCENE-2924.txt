Summary:
fix getting started / demo docs
Description:
Opening a new issue for this since there are a number of problems...:
We should get the versions right, eg when we explain how to do a src checkout it should point to the path for that release
Source checkout / build JARs instructions must be updated for the merger
Analyzers JAR must be on the classpath too
Demo sources are no longer shipped in a binary release
Fixup from LUCENE-2923 (remove web app, new command-line ops for IndexFiles, etc.)
