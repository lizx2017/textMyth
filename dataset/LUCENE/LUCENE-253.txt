Summary:
Merging indexes leads to out-of-memory condition
Description:
Version: 1.4 Final
Platform: Red Hat 9
Method: IndexWriter.addIndexes
My experience with merging indexes of any size results in one outcome:
java.lang.OutOfMemoryError. This is true even on a 1GB machine where almost all
free memory is allocated to the VM.
Is there a way to reliably merge indexes?
I've marked this issue as 'major' for the following reason: Without an
efficient merge capability, the developer must deploy hundreds of 'little'
indexes that will need to be searched in parallel. Unfortunately, this
constraint plus java makes an application too slow to be usable in a production
environment.
Thank you for looking into this issue.

Directory dest = FSDirectory.getDirectory( destination, true);
IndexWriter writer = new IndexWriter( dest, new TermAnalyzer(
StopWords.SEARCH_MAP), true);
writer.addIndexes( sources);
writer.optimize();
writer.close();
