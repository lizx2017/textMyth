Summary:
QueryScorer.init returns empty TokenStream if setMaxDocCharsToAnalyze is not previously called
Description:
This is a regression since Lucene 4.10 regarding The QueryScorer class in the Highlighter module.
In 4.10, the QueryScorer.init method returns a working tokenStream even if the maxCharsToAnalyze variable is set to zero. In both versions, zero is the default value and in 4.10 it indicated that the entire stream should be returned, not an empty stream.
The problem is with the WeightedSpanTermExtractor always wrapping the tokenStream in a OffsetLimitTokenFilter filter, even when the passed down maxDocCharsToAnalyze variable is zero.
