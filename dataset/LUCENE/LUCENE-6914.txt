Summary:
DecimalDigitFilter skips characters in some cases (supplemental?)
Description:
Found this while writing up the solr ref guide for DecimalDigitFilter.
With input like "????" ("Double Struck" 1984) the filter produces "1?8?" (1, double struck 9, 8, double struck 4) add some non-decimal characters in between the digits (ie: "?x?x?x?") and you get the expected output ("1x9x8x4"). This doesn't affect all decimal characters though, as evident by the existing test cases.
Perhaps this is an off by one bug in the "if the original was supplementary, shrink the string" code path?
