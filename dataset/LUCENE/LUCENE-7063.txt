Summary:
NumericUtils vs LegacyNumericUtils chaos with 6.0
Description:
Old prefix-coded terms helper functions are still available in LegacyNumericUtils, but its confusing when upgrading because NumericUtils and LegacyNumericUtils have overlaps in the APIs.
One issue is they share some exact methods that are completely unrelated to this encoding (e.g. floatToSortableInt). The method is just duplication and worst, most lucene code is still calling it from LegacyNumericUtils, even stuff like faceting code using it with docvalues.
Another issue is the new NumericUtils methods (which use full byte range) have vague names, no javadocs, expose helper methods as public unnecessarily, and cause general confusion.
I don't think NumericUtils and LegacyNumericUtils should overlap. LegacyNumericUtils should only contain legacy stuff!
