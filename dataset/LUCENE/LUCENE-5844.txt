Summary:
ArrayUtil.grow should not pretend you can actually allocate array[Integer.MAX_VALUE]
Description:
Today if the growth it wants would exceed Integer.MAX_VALUE, it returns Integer.MAX_VALUE, but you can't actually allocate arrays this large; the actual limit is JVM dependent and varies across JVMs ...
It would be nice if we could somehow "introspect" the JVM to find out what its actual limit is and use that. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3038392/do-java-arrays-have-a-maximum-size seems to imply that using Integer.MAX_VALUE - 8 may be "safe" (it's what ArrayList.java apparently uses).
