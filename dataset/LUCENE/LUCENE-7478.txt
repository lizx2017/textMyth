Summary:
Wrong Formula in LMDirichletSimilarity
Description:
It seems that the formula in LMDirichletSimilarity is wrong or at least is not the formula in the mentioned C.X. Zhai paper.
The main part of formula in LMDirichletSimilarity is:
Math.log(1 + freq /
(mu * ((LMStats)stats).getCollectionProbability())) +
Math.log(mu / (docLen + mu)
which is in fact:
(mu*p(w|C)+c(w,d))/(p(w|C)*(|d| + mu))
while the main formula is:
(mu*p(w|C)+c(w,d))/(|d| + mu)
So a p(w|C) is practically added to the formula.
