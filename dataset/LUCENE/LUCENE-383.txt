Summary:
ConstantScoreRangeQuery - fixes "too many clauses" exception
Description:
ConstantScoreQuery wraps a filter (representing a set of documents) and returns
a constant score for each document in the set.
ConstantScoreRangeQuery implements a RangeQuery that works for any number of
terms in the range. It rewrites to a ConstantScoreQuery that wraps a RangeFilter.
Still needed:
unit tests (these classes have been tested and work fine in-house, but the
current tests rely on too much application specific code)
code review of Weight() implementation (I'm unsure If I got all the score
normalization stuff right)
explain() implementation
NOTE: requires Java 1.4 for BitSet.nextSetBit()
