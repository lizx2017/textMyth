Summary:
Make oal.index.Term more defensive
Description:
oal.index.Term has a Term(String field, BytesRef termBytes) constructor. Even though it warns that the term bytes should not be reused, I'm wondering that we should make it more defensive.
   * <p>WARNING: the provided BytesRef is not copied, but used directly.
   * Therefore the bytes should not be modified after construction, for
   * example, you should clone a copy by {@link BytesRef#deepCopyOf}
   * rather than pass reused bytes from a TermsEnum.
For example if you have term queries in your query cache and they are modified in-place, it would have very bad consequences and would be hard to diagnose.
