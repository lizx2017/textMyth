Summary:
SimilarityBase.computeNorm is inconsistent with TFIDFSimilarity
Description:
SimilarityBase.computeNorm Javadoc indicates that the doc length should be encoded in the same way as TFIDFSimilarity. However, when discountOverlaps is false, what gets encoded is SmallFloat.floatToByte315((boost / (float) Math.sqrt(docLen / boost))); rather than SmallFloat.floatToByte315((boost / (float) Math.sqrt(length))); due to the extra / state.getBoost() term in SimilarityBase.computeNorm:
final float numTerms;
if (discountOverlaps)
numTerms = state.getLength() - state.getNumOverlap();
else
numTerms = state.getLength() / state.getBoost();
return encodeNormValue(state.getBoost(), numTerms);
