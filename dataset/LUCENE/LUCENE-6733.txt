Summary:
Incorrect URL causes build break - analysis/kuromoji
Description:
Ivy.xml contains dictionary URL both of IPADIC and NAIST-JDIC.
But there’re already gone. No existing. So it causes build break at download-dict task.
Google Code will be closed soon later. And SouceForge(.jp not .net) was moved osdn.jp.
Fumm… not sure how I can attach a patch file… I can’t find a field. later ?
