Summary:
Lucene Search does not handle boolean queries with quotes.
Description:
Dear All,
I am making use of Lucene 1.4. At this moment i am trying to execute the
following query:
"Gesproken dagblad" AND "ROODE DEKENS".
But Lucene does not return any hit (even the words are into the same document
in the index).
But, if I use OR operator, then i can get the hits without any problem.
If I do execute each query apart ("Gesproken dagblad" in one query and "ROODE
DEKENS" in another query), then I get into the results the same document.
Does anyone knows what can be exactly the problem?
Kind Regards
Kike
