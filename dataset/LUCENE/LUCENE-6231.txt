Summary:
smokeTestRelease.py should retry failed downloads
Description:
In the 5.0 RC2 vote thread, Anshum Gupta mentioned that 6 attempts at running the smoke tester against the people.apache.org RC URL all failed because of download failures.
I had the same problem - my first two attempts also failed because of failed downloads - here's the trace from one of them:

The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:

I did a recursive download of the RC2 folder on people.apache.org using wget, and there were three download failures, which wget auto-retried, and succeeded in each case on the second attempt - two of these were timeouts and the third was a reset connection:
HTTP request sent, awaiting response... No data received.
Retrying.
[...]
HTTP request sent, awaiting response... Read error (Connection reset by peer) in headers.
Retrying.
I think we should just automatically retry all failed downloads once.
