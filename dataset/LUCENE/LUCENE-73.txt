Summary:
QueryParser throws ParseException with fuzzy search
Description:
The QueryParser sometimes throws an exception when using fuzzy search. This
appears to happen whenever it can't find any matches. For example, in my
application it works fine for "super~" but not "supernova~", and works for
"etc~" and "etcs~" but not "et~" or "etcss~":
org.apache.lucene.queryParser.ParseException: Lexical error at line 1, column 7.
