Summary:
IOUtils.spins doesn't work for NVMe drives
Description:
NVMe is the faster (than AHCI) protocol for newer SSDs that plug into the PCIE bus.
I just built a new beast box with one of these drives, and the partition is named /dev/nvme0n1p1 while the device is /dev/nvme0n1 by Linux - this also appears in /sys/block with rotational=0.
I think Steve Rowe also has an NVME drive ...
Uwe Schindler (who got the box working for me: thank you!!!) has ideas on how to fix it!
