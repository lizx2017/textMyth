Summary:
Remove divide-by-zero formula hacks across sim impls
Description:
Follow-up to LUCENE-8020
With the scoring api no longer passing e.g. docFreq=0 in corner cases such as SpanOrQuery, we can revert formula hacks that we added to many similarities. It may not be very significant for ranking but it removes confusion and makes it possible to have good explain() etc.
