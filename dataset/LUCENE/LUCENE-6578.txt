Summary:
Geo3d: arcDistanceToShape() method may be useful
Description:
I've got an application that seems like it may need the ability to compute a new kind of arc distance, from a GeoPoint to the nearest edge/point of a GeoShape. Adding this method to the interface, and corresponding implementations, would increase the utility of the package for ranking purposes.
