Summary:
Possible bug in StemmerOverrideFilter / FST
Description:
We ran across an issue in a custom token filter that like the StemmerOverrideFilter relies on the FST. The issue is reproducible in the StemmerOverrideFilter. I am not sure whether it is a real problem in the FST.
Attached a patch with a unit test that is going to fail. It uses random input with some code from commons-lang3.
