Summary:
EnwikiContentSource thread safety problem (NPE) in 'forever' mode
Description:
If close() is invoked around when an additional input stream reader is recreated for the 'forever' behavior, an uncaught NPE might occur.
This bug was probably always there, just exposed now with the EnwikioContentSourceTest added in LUCENE-4588.
