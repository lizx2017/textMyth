Summary:
IndexFileDeleter AssertionError in presence of *_upgraded.si files
Description:
When calling IndexWriter.deleteUnusedFiles against an index that contains 3.x segments, i am seeing the following exception:
java.lang.AssertionError: failAndDumpStackJunitStatment: RefCount is 0 pre-decrement for file "_0_upgraded.si"
        at org.apache.lucene.index.IndexFileDeleter$RefCount.DecRef(IndexFileDeleter.java:630)
        at org.apache.lucene.index.IndexFileDeleter.decRef(IndexFileDeleter.java:514)
        at org.apache.lucene.index.IndexFileDeleter.deleteCommits(IndexFileDeleter.java:286)
        at org.apache.lucene.index.IndexFileDeleter.revisitPolicy(IndexFileDeleter.java:393)
        at org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter.deleteUnusedFiles(IndexWriter.java:4617)
I believe this is caused by IndexFileDeleter not being aware of the Lucene3x Segment Infos Format (notably the _upgraded.si files created to "upgrade" an old index)
This is new in 4.7 and did not occur in 4.6.1
Still trying to track down a workaround/fix
