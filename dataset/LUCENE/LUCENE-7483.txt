Summary:
QueryParser changes OR clausule to AND
Description:
QueryParser incorrectly parses the expression t1 AND t2 OR t3 AND t4 as
(+t1 +t2 +t3 +t4) while t1 AND t2 AND t3 AND t4 produces the same result.
The expected result for expression t1 AND t2 OR t3 AND t4 is (+t1 +t2) (+t3 +t4).
This occurs using StandardQueryParser or classic.QueryParser.
