Summary:
"ant nightly-smoke" ignores local code changes
Description:
While trying to test SOLR-4803 i discovered that "ant nightly-smoke" was ignoring my local (uncommited) source changes in it's smoke checks.
specifically: it was running the solr example using an unpacked version of artifacts built from an svn-export that did not include my changes, so test_utf8.sh was still failing.
i'm not sure if it is intentional that the svn export is used instead of the current working checkout, but it seems like something needs to change, either...
"ant nightly-smoke" should fail if the working dir is a dirty checkout
"ant nightly-smoke" should use the current working dir even if it's a dirty checkout.
