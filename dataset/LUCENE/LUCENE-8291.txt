Summary:
Possible security issue when parsing XML documents containing external entity references
Description:
It appears that in QueryTemplateManager.java lines 149 and 198 and in DOMUtils.java line 204 XML is parsed without disabling external entity references (XXE). This is described in http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/611.html and possible mitigations are listed here: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XML_External_Entity_(XXE)_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet
All recent versions of lucene are affected.
