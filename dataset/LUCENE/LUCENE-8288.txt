Summary:
Context query with regex "." produces an assertion failure
Description:
When a RegexCompletionQuery of "." is provided to ContextQuery, the following assertion failure occurs:
java.lang.AssertionError: input should not end with a context separator followed by SEP_LABEL

Note that this is a related, but distinct issue from https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-8287, where the RegexCompletionQuery is empty.
The attached patch provides a reproduction of the issue, as the test case TestContextQuery#testRegexDotQuery. To reproduce, Java assertions must be enabled (as in the default configuration for tests).
The patch also provides a test case for the normal behavior of an empty RegexCompletionQuery, when it is not wrapped in ContextQuery (TestRegexCompletionQuery#testRegexDotQuery). In this case, there is no error, and all suggestions are returned.
From a quick look, it seems as though "." doesn't capture any characters past  CompletionAnalyzer.SEP_LABEL, so the matching prefix in ContextCompletionWeight#setInnerWeight is unexpectedly empty.
