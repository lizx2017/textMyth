Summary:
NativeUnixDirectory is broken
Description:
Several things:
It assumed ByteBuffer.allocateDirect would be page-aligned, but
that's no longer true in Java 1.7
It failed to throw FNFE if a file didn't exist (throw IOExc
instead)
It didn't have a default ctor taking File (so it was hard to run
all tests against it)
It didn't have a test case
Some Javadocs problems
I cutover to FilterDirectory
I tried to cutover to BufferedIndexOutput since this is essentially
all that NativeUnixIO is doing ... but it's not simple because BIO
sometimes flushes non-full (non-aligned) buffers even before the end
of the file (its writeBytes method).
I also factored out a BaseDirectoryTestCase, and tried to fold in
"generic" Directory tests, and added/cutover explicit tests for the
core directory impls.
