Summary:
BlendedInfixSuggester bad score calculus for certain suggestion weights
Description:
Currently the BlendedInfixSuggester return a (long) score to rank the suggestions.
This score is calculated as a multiplication between :
long Weight : the suggestion weight, coming from a document field, it can be any long value ( including 1, 0,.. )
double Coefficient : 0<=x<=1, calculated based on the position match, earlier the better
The resulting score is a long, which means that at the moment, any weight<10 can bring inconsistencies.
Edge cases 
Weight =1
Score = 1( if we have a match at the beginning of the suggestion) or 0 ( for any other match)
Weight =0
Score = 0 ( independently of the position match coefficient)
