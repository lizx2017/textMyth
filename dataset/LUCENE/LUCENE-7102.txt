Summary:
LatLonPoint newDistanceSort fails with "sort missing first"
Description:
The distance sort comparator creates bounding boxes when the priority queue is full, to speed up sorting.
But with missing values (which we don't test), they can be e.g. -Inf/+Inf and we do the wrong thing (e.g. try to make illegal infinite bounding boxes).
