Summary:
LevenshteinDistance code normalization is incorrect
Description:
The normalization of the edit distance should use the maximum of the two string being compared instead of the minimum. Otherwise negative distances are possible. The spell checker filters out edits below a certain threshold so this hasn't been a problem in practice.
