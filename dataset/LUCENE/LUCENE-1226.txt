Summary:
IndexWriter.addIndexes(IndexReader[]) fails to create compound files
Description:
Even if no exception is thrown while writing the compound file at the end of the
addIndexes() call, the transaction is rolled back and the successfully written cfs
file deleted. The fix is simple: There is just the
success = true;
statement missing at the end of the try{} clause.
All tests pass. I'll commit this soon to trunk and 2.3.2.
