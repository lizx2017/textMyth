Summary:
"System Properties" doc lists "lockDir" instead of "lockdir"
Description:
The "System Properties" documentation page states that the lock file directory
can be set with the system property "org.apache.lucene.lockDir". However, as
implemented in org.apache.lucene.store.FSDirectory, line 56, the property name
is actually "org.apache.lucene.lockdir" (lower case "d" in "lockdir").
Recommend changing documentation to match code.
