Summary:
Nested Span Queries are buggy
Description:
Example for a nested SpanQuery that is not working:
Document: Human Genome Organization , HUGO , is trying to coordinate gene mapping research worldwide.
Query: spanNear([body:coordinate, spanOr([spanNear([body:gene, body:mapping], 0, true), body:gene]), body:research], 0, true)
The query should match "coordinate gene mapping research" as well as "coordinate gene research". It does not match "coordinate gene mapping research" with Lucene 5.5 or 6.1, it did however match with Lucene 4.10.4. It probably stopped working with the changes on SpanQueries in 5.3. I will attach a unit test that shows the problem.
