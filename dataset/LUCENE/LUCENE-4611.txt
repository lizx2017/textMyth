Summary:
remove duplicate 3rd party versioning from build.xmls
Description:
At first we had lots of stuff in lib/ including .sha1 files and so on. So we didnt want to have this in the classpath because its just noisy.
But nowadays we use an ivy sync=true, the only things in lib are the jars in the ivy.xml.
So we can just put lib/ dirs in the classpath and not have redundant jar names also in build.xml: this makes it harder to upgrade and maintain.
