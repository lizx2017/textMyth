Summary:
GeoPointInPolygonQuery occasionally fails with incorrect ranges
Description:
With high resolution polygons (small sizes) GeoPolygonTermsEnum occasionally fails to compute the correct number of ranges. In certain cases the TermsEnum is completely empty. This leads to incorrect query results in the form of both false positives and negatives.
