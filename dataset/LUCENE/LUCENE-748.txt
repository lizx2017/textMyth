Summary:
Exception during IndexWriter.close() prevents release of the write.lock
Description:
After encountering a case of index corruption - see http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-140 - when the close() method encounters an exception in the flushRamSegments() method, the index write.lock is not released (ie. it is not really closed).
The writelock is only released when the IndexWriter is GC'd and finalize() is called.
