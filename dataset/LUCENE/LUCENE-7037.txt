Summary:
Switch all exception tests to expectThrows()
Description:
Tests expecting exceptions today are done in various ways.
The best ones look like this.
try {
  something();
  fail("message");
} catch (Exception expected) {
  assertSomethingAbout(expected);
}
But there are many forms (involving booleans and such). All of these are a little sketchy because it is all-too easy to just forget the fail() and then the whole test is useless.
`expectThrows` was added in LUCENE-7009 which solves a lot of these problems. Its not perfect, but overall a big improvement. We should cut over all of our tests.
