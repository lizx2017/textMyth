Summary:
ComplexPhraseQueryParser.ComplexPhraseQuery does not display slop in toString()
Description:
This one is quite simple (I think) â€“ ComplexPhraseQuery doesn't display the slop factor which, when the result of parsing is dumped to logs, for example, can be confusing.
I'm heading for a weekend out of office in a few hours... so in the spirit of not committing and running away ( ), if anybody wishes to tackle this, go ahead.
