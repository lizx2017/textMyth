Summary:
TooManyClause when having large number of hits
Description:
Lucene version 1.3 final release
I have an index with 356554 documents. I've indexed files of an average size of
10kb.The documents in lucene have 4 field. One used as primary key, one as the
name of the file, the third the content and the last the date of the file.
Building a RangeQuery I tried to search in the content of the file (field
name="content") and before a specific date (each file is older than the
specified date so all document should have been returned) I got the following
exception:
org.apache.lucene.search.BooleanQuery$TooManyClauses
at org.apache.lucene.search.BooleanQuery.add(BooleanQuery.java:109)
at org.apache.lucene.search.BooleanQuery.add(BooleanQuery.java:101)
at org.apache.lucene.search.RangeQuery.rewrite(RangeQuery.java:137)
at org.apache.lucene.search.BooleanQuery.rewrite(BooleanQuery.java:244)
at org.apache.lucene.search.IndexSearcher.rewrite(IndexSearcher.java:188)
The string representation of the Query is:
+(+content:reuters) +date:[ TO 0dovxpz40]
where "content" is the field where the file content is indexed
and "date" the field containing the date, stored via DateField.dateToString(Date)
