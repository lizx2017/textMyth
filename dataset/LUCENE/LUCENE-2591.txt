Summary:
TestNLS fails with ja locale
Description:
set ANT_ARGS="-Dargs=-Duser.language=ja -Duser.country=JP"
ant test-core -Dtestcase=TestNLS
The test has 2 sets of message, one fallback, and one ja.
The tests assume if it asks for a non-ja locale, that it will get the fallback message,
but this is not how ResourceBundle.getBundle works:
Otherwise, the following sequence is generated from the attribute values of the specified locale 
(language1, country1, and variant1) and of the default locale (language2, country2, and variant2):

baseName + "_" + language1 + "_" + country1 + "_" + variant1
baseName + "_" + language1 + "_" + country1
baseName + "_" + language1
baseName + "_" + language2 + "_" + country2 + "_" + variant2
baseName + "_" + language2 + "_" + country2
baseName + "_" + language2
baseName
So in the case of ja default locale, you get a japanese message instead from the baseName + "_" + language2 match
