Summary:
Remove IndexWriterConfig.get/setMaxThreadStates
Description:
Ever since LUCENE-5644, IndexWriter will aggressively reuse its internal thread states across threads, whenever one is free.
I think this means we can safely remove the sneaky maxThreadStates limit (default 8) that we have today: IW will only ever allocate as many thread states as there are actual concurrent threads running through it.
