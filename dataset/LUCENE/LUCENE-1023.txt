Summary:
When the index has more than 1 segment, norms take 2 bytes of RAM per norm not 1
Description:
When norms are loaded for an index with multiple segments,
MultiSegmentReader caches a byte array for all norms (concatenated
from all segments), and SegmentReader also caches a byte array for its
norms. I think MultiSegmentReader should somehow tell SegmentReader
not cache its own norms. For a large index this will save quite a bit
of memory (1 byte per document per field-with-norms).
