Summary:
NormsFieldExistsQuery to match documents where field exists based on field norms
Description:
This patch adds a new NormsFieldExistsQuery which is similar to DocValuesFieldExistsQuery but instead of determining whether a document has a value for a field based on doc values it does this based on the field norms so the same kind of exists query functionality can be performed on TextFields which have no doc values.
