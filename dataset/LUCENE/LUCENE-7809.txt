Summary:
spatial-extras module is not present under IntelliJ 2017.1
Description:
When I run ant clean-idea idea, project compilation fails because modules that depend on spatial-extras can't find it, because it is not defined.
The issue appears to be that IntelliJ 2017.1 has dropped support for some vestigial markup present in spatial-extras' .iml file.
