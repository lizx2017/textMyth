Summary:
TestBackwardsCompatibility#testAllVersionsTested should fail if the version of a bwc index is missing
Description:
There is a leniency in the test that makes the test pass if a bwc index doesn't have a version associated to it:
// we could be missing up to 1 file, which may be due to a release that is in progress
    if (missingFiles.size() <= 1 && extraFiles.isEmpty()) {
      // success
      return;
    }
I think this test can be removed since we add the new released version in the non-release branches only after the release. Then we'd need to add the released version and
the BWC test in the non-release branches in the same commit so that the test never fails.
