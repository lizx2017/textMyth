Summary:
Ensure Lucene sources don't swallow root cause exceptions
Description:
Robert Muir created a nice tool to look at the Java bytecode to determine whether e.g. a finally or catch clause may ignore the original root cause exception, here: https://github.com/rmuir/elasticsearch/tree/catchAnalyzer
It's a fork of ES but I think maybe we can extract it and use it in Lucene.
Unlike Python, Java unfortunately does not seem to have safeguards against exceptionally handling code accidentally losing the original exception.
