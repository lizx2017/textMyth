Summary:
FVH can end in very very long running recursion on phrase highlight
Description:
due to the nature of FVH extract logic a simple phrase query can put a FHV into a super long running recursion. I had documents taking literally days to return form the extract phrases logic. I have a test that reproduces the problem and a possible fix. The reason for this is that the FVH never tries to early terminate if a phrase is already way beyond the slop coming from the phrase query. If there is a document with lot of occurrences or two or more terms in the phrase this literally tries to match all possible combinations of the terms in the doc.
