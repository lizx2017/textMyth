Summary:
Scorer.getChildren() can throw or hide a subscorer for some boolean queries
Description:
I've isolated two example boolean queries that don't behave with release 4.9 of Lucene.
A BooleanQuery with three SHOULD clauses and a minimumNumberShouldMatch of 2 will throw an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.
java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 2

A BooleanQuery with two should clauses, one of which is a miss for all documents in the current segment will accidentally mask the scorer that was a hit.
Unit tests and patch based on branch_4x are available and will be attached as soon as this ticket has a number.
They are immediately available on GitHub on branch shebiki/bqgetchildren as commit c64bb6f.
I took the liberty of naming the relationship in BoostingScorer.getChildren() BOOSTING. Suspect someone will offer a better name for this. Here is a summary of the various relationships in play for all Scorer.getChildren() implementations on branch_4x to help choose.

I also removed FilterScorer.getChildren() to prevent mistakes and force subclasses to provide a correct implementation.
