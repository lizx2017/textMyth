Summary:
checkJavaDocs.py mis-chunks javadocs HTML and then wrongly reports imbalanced tags
Description:
Spin-off from SOLR-9107, where Hoss Man wrote:
but as things stand with this patch, precommit currently complains about malformed javadocs...
     [echo] Checking for malformed docs...
     [exec] 
     [exec] /home/hossman/lucene/dev/solr/build/docs/solr-test-framework/org/apache/solr/util/RandomizeSSL.html
     [exec]   broken details HTML: Field Detail: reason: saw closing "</ul>" without opening <ul...>
     [exec]   broken details HTML: Field Detail: ssl: saw closing "</ul>" without opening <ul...>
     [exec]   broken details HTML: Field Detail: clientAuth: saw closing "</ul>" without opening <ul...>
...but i can't really understand why. The <ul> tags look balanced to me, and tidy -output /dev/null .../RandomizeSSL.html concurs that "No warnings or errors were found." I thought maybe the problem was related to some of the @see tags in the docs for these attributes, but even if i completley remove the javadocs the same validation errors occur.
When I modify checkJavaDocs.py to print out the offending chunk of HTML, here's what I see for the first of the above:
solr/build/docs/solr-test-framework/org/apache/solr/util/RandomizeSSL.html
  broken details HTML: Field Detail: reason: saw closing "</ul>" without opening <ul...> in:
-----
<ul><pre>public abstract&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/String.html?is-external=true" title="class or interface in java.lang">String</a>&nbsp;reason</pre>
<div class="block">Comment to inlcude when logging details of SSL randomization</div>
<dl>
<dt>Default:</dt>
<dd>""</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul class="blockList">
<li class="blockList"><a name="ssl--">
<!--   -->
</a>
<ul class="blockList">
<li class="blockList">
</ul>
So the chunking that's happening here isn't aligning with the detail HTML for methods, fields etc. - it doesn't start early enough and ends too late.
Furthormore, I can see that the chunking procedure ignores the final item in an HTML file (the stuff after the last <h4>) - if I insert trash after the final <h4>, but within the javadocs for the corresponding final detail item in the HTML file, the current implementation ignores the problem.
