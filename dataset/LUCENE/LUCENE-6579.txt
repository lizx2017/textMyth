Summary:
Unexpected merge exceptions should be tragic to IndexWriter
Description:
Today our behavior is weird: we will fail the merge (which is running in a background thread if you are using the default CMS), pause for 1.0 seconds, and then the next chance we get, kick off the merge again.
I think this is a poor default, e.g. on disk full we will just keep "trying" and filling up disk again, wasting IO/CPU.
I think IW should declare this a tragedy instead?
