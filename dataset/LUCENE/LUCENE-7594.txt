Summary:
Float/DoublePoint should not recommend using Math.nextUp/nextDown for exclusive ranges
Description:
Float/Double points are supposed to be consistent with Double/Float.compare, so +0 is supposed to compare greater than -0. However Math.nextUp/nextDown is not consistent with Double/Float.compare and returns MIN_VALUE for nextUp(-0).
