Summary:
explain should not mask negative scores
Description:
Explanation.isMatch() returns false for 0 or negative scores.
Hence negative scores are omitted from the explanation.
This causes, when using e.g. BoostingTermQuery with negative boosts, a difference between the collected doc score and the score shown by explain().
A word on the usage of this - BTQ with negative boosts is useful for "punishing" documents for containing a term. It also allows all sorts of tricks with multiplying query boost by the BTQ boost, so you get a positive score if both boosts have the same sign but negative otherwise. - I am sure there other uses as well.
