Summary:
Automaton Fuzzy Query doesn't deliver all results
Description:
Having a small index with n documents where each document has one of the following terms:
WEBER, WEBE, WEB, WBR, WE, (and some more)
The new FuzzyQuery (Automaton) with maxEdits=2 only delivers the expected terms WEBER and WEBE in the rewritten query. The expected terms WEB and WBR which have an edit distance of 2 as well are missing.
