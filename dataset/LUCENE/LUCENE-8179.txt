Summary:
StandardTokenizer doesn't tokenize the word "system" but it works for the plural "systems"
Description:
Hi,
We use the Standard tokenizer to tokenize text. The Standard Tokenizer tokenizes 'systems' correctly, but it fails to tokenize 'system' Attached a small program to demo this.
Is this a known issue.Is there a way to fix it? I have tried a few different text examples with different stop words and only this word seems to show this issue.
