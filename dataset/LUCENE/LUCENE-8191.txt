Summary:
merge TestRandomChains "brokenConstructors" list with "brokenOffsetsConstructors"
Description:
Now that indexwriter checks offsets (LUCENE-7626), there is no difference between the two: A tokenstream that has brokenoffsets will fail regardless, only in a harder-to-debug way (e.g. some low level exception from indexwriter).
So I think we should just merge the two lists to reflect that: if it produces brokenOffsets, its broken.
