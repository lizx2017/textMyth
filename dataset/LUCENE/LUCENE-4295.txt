Summary:
smoke test an unsigned release in hudson nightly
Description:
Currently to build a release, its a huge battle to get the smoke tester "up to speed"
so the checks are actually current and everything works, and its python so
its pretty fragile (no compile time checking).
So I think its time to do this in the nightly build, otherwise release managers, python
gurus, policeman, and whoever just likes punishment has to do a lot of work before the release
to adapt to all the changes: its easier to keep this stuff maintained incrementally.
We need a top-level task 'nightly-smoke' that does prepare-release-no-sign for lucene + solr,
then smoke tests it and fails if the smoke tester fails.
