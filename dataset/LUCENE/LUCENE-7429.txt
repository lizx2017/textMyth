Summary:
DelegatingAnalyzerWrapper should delegate normalization too
Description:
This is something that I overlooked in LUCENE-7355: (Delegating)AnalyzerWrapper uses the default implementation of initReaderForNormalization and normalize, meaning that by default the normalization is a no-op. It should delegate to the wrapped analyzer.
