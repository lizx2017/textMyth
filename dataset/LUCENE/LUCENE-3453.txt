Summary:
remove IndexDocValuesField
Description:
Its confusing how we present CSF functionality to the user, its actually not a "field" but an "attribute" of a field like STORED or INDEXED.
Otherwise, its really hard to think about CSF because there is a mismatch between the APIs and the index format.
