Summary:
Possible file handle leak in near real-time reader
Description:
Spinoff of LUCENE-1526: Jake/John hit file descriptor exhaustion when testing NRT.
I've tried to repro this, stress testing NRT, saturating reopens, indexing, searching, but haven't found any issue.
Let's try to get to the bottom of it, here...
