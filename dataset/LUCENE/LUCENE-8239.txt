Summary:
GeoComplexPolygon fails when test or/and check point are near a pole
Description:
When calling within method in GeoComplexPolygon you can get errors if the test point of the polygon or the given point is near a pole.
The reason is that one of the planes defined by these points is tangent to the world therefore intersection with the above plane fails. We should prevent navigating those planes ( we should not even construct them).
