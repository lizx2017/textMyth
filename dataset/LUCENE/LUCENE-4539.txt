Summary:
DocValues impls should read all headers up-front instead of per-directsource
Description:
Currently, when DocValues opens, it just opens files. it doesnt read codec headers etc.
Instead we read these every single time a directsource opens.
I think it should work like PostingsReaders: e.g. the PackedInts impl would read its versioning info and codec headers and creating a new Direct impl should be a IndexInput.clone() + getDirectReaderNoHeader().
Today its much more costly.
