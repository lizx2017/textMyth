Summary:
IOException when trying to delete data from index
Description:
I have a small test prog which inserts some data in an index and after that, opens a searcher from the uncommitted index to search on and output the result to std.out. The Searcher is immediately closed. Then, i call deleteAll() on the index but it encounters an IOException stating that the index files could not be removed. I have investigated with Sysinternals and it says the file is still locked despite the fact that the index searcher is correctly closed. If i call deleteAll() without opening a searcher before it just works fine as expected. This seems to be a bug in Lucene, since closing the index searcher makes it impossible to delete the index.
Here is the source code:
Bar.java
public class LuceneTest {

    private Directory dir;
    private IndexWriter writer;
    
    public void addDocs(long value) throws IOException {
        Document doc = new Document();
        doc.add(new LongField("ID", value, Field.Store.YES));
        writer.deleteDocuments(new Term("ID", "1"));
        writer.addDocument(doc);
    }
    
    public void search() throws IOException {
      IndexSearcher searcher = new IndexSearcher(DirectoryReader.open(writer, false));
        TopDocs results = searcher.search(NumericRangeQuery.newLongRange("ID", 1L, 2L, true, true), 1);
        
        for ( ScoreDoc sc : results.scoreDocs) {
            System.out.println(searcher.doc(sc.doc));
        }
        
        searcher.getIndexReader().close();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        new LuceneTest();
    }
    
    public LuceneTest() throws IOException {
        dir = FSDirectory.open(new File("test"));
        IndexWriterConfig config = new IndexWriterConfig(Version.LUCENE_43, new StandardAnalyzer(Version.LUCENE_43));
        config.setInfoStream(System.out);
        writer = new IndexWriter(dir, config);
        
        addDocs(1L); 
        search();
        //writer.commit(); -- If i call commit after search, then no IOException occurrs!
        
        writer.deleteAll();
    }
}
