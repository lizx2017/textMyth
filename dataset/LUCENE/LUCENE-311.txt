Summary:
[PATCH] queryParser.setOperator(int) should be made typesafe
Description:
There are AND and DEFAULT_OPERATOR_AND in QueryParser, so calling
setOperator(QueryParser.AND) looks okay and compiles, but it's not correct.
I'll attach a patch that uses a typesafe enum to avoid this problem. As
there's also a getOperator method I had to change the name of the new method
to get/setDefaultOperator. I don't like that, but it seems to be the only way
to avoid compile errors for people who switch to a new version of Lucene.
Okay to commit?
