Summary:
AnalyzingInfixSuggester needs duplicate handling
Description:
Spinoff from LUCENE-5833 but else unrelated.
Using AnalyzingInfixSuggester which is backed by a Lucene index and stores payload and score together with the suggest text.
I did some testing with Solr, producing the DocumentDictionary from an index with multiple documents containing the same text, but with random weights between 0-100. Then I got duplicate identical suggestions sorted by weight:
{
  "suggest":{"languages":{
      "engl":{
        "numFound":101,
        "suggestions":[{
            "term":"<b>Engl</b>ish",
            "weight":100,
            "payload":"0"},
          {
            "term":"<b>Engl</b>ish",
            "weight":99,
            "payload":"0"},
          {
            "term":"<b>Engl</b>ish",
            "weight":98,
            "payload":"0"},
---etc all the way down to 0---
I also reproduced the same behavior in AnalyzingInfixSuggester directly. So there is a need for some duplicate removal here, either while building the local suggest index or during lookup. Only the highest weight suggestion for a given term should be returned.
