Summary:
WordDelimiterTokenFilter does not generate all tokens appropriately
Description:
When using word delimiter token filter some expected tokens are not generated.
When I try to analyze the text "ElasticSearch.TestProject"
I expect the tokens elastic, search, test, project, elasticsearch, testproject, elasticsearch.testproject to be generated since I have split_on_case_change, split_on_numerics on and using a whitespace tokenizer and have preserve original true.
But Actually I only see following tokens -
elasticsearch.testproject, elastic, search, test, project
