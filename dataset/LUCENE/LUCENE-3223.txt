Summary:
SearchWithSortTask ignores sorting by Doc
Description:
During my work in LUCENE-3912, I found the following code:
if (field.equals("doc")) {
    sortField0 = SortField.FIELD_DOC;
} if (field.equals("score")) {
    sortField0 = SortField.FIELD_SCORE;
} ...
This means the setting of SortField.FIELD_DOC is ignored. While I don't know much about this code, this seems like a valid setting and obviously just a bug.
