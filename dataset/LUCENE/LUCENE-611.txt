Summary:
TestConstantScoreRangeQuery does not compile with ecj
Description:
TestConstantScoreRangeQuery has an assertEquals(String, Float, Float)
but most of the calls to assertEquals are (String, int, int).
ecj complains with the following error:
The method assertEquals(String, float, float) is ambiguous for the type TestConstantScoreRangeQuery
The simple solution is to supply an assertEquals(String, int, int) which calls Assert.assertEquals(String, int, int)
Patch to follow.
