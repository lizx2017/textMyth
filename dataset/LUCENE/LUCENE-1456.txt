Summary:
FieldInfo omitTerms bug
Description:
Around line 95 you have:
if (this.omitTf != omitTf)
{ this.omitTf = true; // if one require omitTf at least once, it remains off for life }
Both references of the omitTf booleans in the if statement refer to the same field. I am guessing its meant to be other.omitTf like the norms code above it.
