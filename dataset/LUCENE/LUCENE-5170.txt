Summary:
Add getter for reuse strategy to Analyzer, make AnalyzerWrapper's reuse strategy configureable, fix strategy to be stateless
Description:
If you write an Analyzer that wraps another one (but without using AnalyzerWrapper) you may need use the same reuse strategy in your wrapper. This is not possible as there is no way to get the reuse startegy (private field and no getter).
An example is ES's NamedAnalyzer, see my comment: https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/commit/b9a2fbd8741aa1b9beffb7d2922fc9b4525397e4#src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/index/analysis/NamedAnalyzer.java
This would add a getter, just a 3-liner.
