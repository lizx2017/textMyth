Summary:
Document is partially indexed on an unhandled exception
Description:
With LUCENE-843, it's now possible for a subset of a document's
fields/terms to be indexed or stored when an exception is hit. This
was not the case in the past (it was "all or none").
I plan to make it "all or none" again by immediately marking a
document as deleted if any exception is hit while indexing it.
