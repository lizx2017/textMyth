Summary:
DateRangePrefixTree trouble finding years >= 292,000,000
Description:
Using DateRangePrefixTree (in spatial-extras): When indexing years on or after the last million-year period supported by most computer systems, +292,000,000, a range query like [1970 TO *] will fail to find it. This happens as a result of some off-by-one errors in DateRangePrefixTree.
