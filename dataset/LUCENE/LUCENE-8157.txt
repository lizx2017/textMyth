Summary:
GeoPolygon factory fails in recognize convex polygon
Description:
When a polygon contains three consecutive points which are nearly co-planar, the polygon factory may fail to recognize the concavity/convexity of the polygon. I think the problem is the way the sideness for a polygon edge is calculated. It relies in the position of the next point in respect of the previous polygon edge which fails on the case explained above because of numerical imprecision. The result is that sideness is messed up.
