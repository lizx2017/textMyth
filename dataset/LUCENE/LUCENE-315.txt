Summary:
Documentation Error for FilteredTermEnum
Description:
As pointed out in
http://nagoya.apache.org/eyebrowse/ReadMsg?listName=lucene-user@jakarta.apache.org&msgNo=11034
the documentation of FilteredTermEnum.term() is wrong:
it says
'Returns the current Term in the enumeration. Initially invalid, valid after
next() called for the first time.'
but the implementation of the constructors of the two derived classes
(FuzzyTermEnum and WildcardTermEnum) already initializes the object to point to
the first match. So calling next() before accessing terms will leave out the
first match.
So I suggest to replace the second sentance by something like
'Returns null if no Term matches or all terms have been enumerated.'
(I checked that for WildcardTermEnum only).
Further one might add some note to the docs of the constructors of FuzzyTermEnum
and WildcardTermEnum that they will point to the first element of the
enumeration (if any).
