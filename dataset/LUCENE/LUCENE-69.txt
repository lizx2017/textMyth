Summary:
Date field created with Field#Kewyord is tokenized.
Description:
The factory method Field#Keyword(String field, Date name) tokenizes the field.
This is unnecessary and inconsistent with Field#Keyword(String field, String
value). Coulds this be related to the fact that DateFiled#dateToString now
prepends space instead of '0'?
Tested against 13.11.02 nightly build.
