Summary:
Field class should not let you analyze int values?
Description:
I stumbled on this by accident, by creating a Field instance with a Integer value for its fieldsData and then setting tokenized = true in its FieldType.
If you do this then Lucene silently converts the int to a string and then tokenizes it, e.g. applying synonyms, etc., if that's what your analysis chain does.
