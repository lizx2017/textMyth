Summary:
NRTCachingDirectory shouldn't log to stdout
Description:
NRTCachingDirectory declares final boolean VERBOSE = false and then checks this value when determining whether to write additional logging to stdout or not.
Since this is only useful during development, we should change all of the statements to use proper debug logging that can be turned on/off via configuration in production.
