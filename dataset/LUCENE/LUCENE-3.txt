Summary:
Prefix Queries cannot be case insensitive
Description:
Hi. I am using a cvs version of Lucene (got on 2001.10.11).
I am having the following problem: while I can achieve case insensibility of the
search engine by using the correct tokenizer (a derivative of
LowerCaseTokenizer, which passes alphanumeric characters instead of letters only
as token components), I cannot have this feature work with prefix queries.
As I am currently working on the problem myself, I can submit a solution fixing
this bug in some future.
