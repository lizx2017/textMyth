Summary:
Attempting to link to Java SE JavaDocs is competely unreliable
Description:
As noted several times since Oracle bought Sun, the canonical links to the Java SE JavaDocs have been unreliable and frequently cause warnings.
Since we choose to fail the build on javadoc warnings, this is a serious problem for anyone trying to build from source if/when the package-list we reference in our common-build.xml is not available.
We should eliminate this dependency.
