Summary:
poll-mirrors.pl requires additional perl packages?
Description:
I have a newish Ubuntu 16.04.1 install ... and I'm doing the Lucene/Solr 6.2.0 release on it.
Our release process is already hard enough.
When I get to the step to poll the mirrors to see whether Maven central and the apache mirrors have the release bits yet, I hit this:
14:51 $ perl ../dev-tools/scripts/poll-mirrors.pl -version 6.2.0
perl ../dev-tools/scripts/poll-mirrors.pl -version 6.2.0
Can't locate LWP/UserAgent.pm in @INC (you may need to install the LWP::UserAgent module) (@INC contains: /etc/perl /usr/local/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/perl/5.22.1 /usr/local/share/perl/5.22.1 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/perl5/5.22 /usr/share/perl5 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/perl/5.22 /usr/share/perl/5.22 /usr/local/lib/site_perl /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/perl-base .) at ../dev-tools/scripts/poll-mirrors.pl line 31.
BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at ../dev-tools/scripts/poll-mirrors.pl line 31.
How can it be that such a trivial script would need optional perl packages installed? It seems all it's trying to do is download stuff over HTTP at this point?
So I fire up cpan, asking it to install LWP/UserAgent.pm and it hits all sorts of errors that I cannot understand.
Can we somehow simplify this script to use mere mortal perl packages? Or is something badly wrong with my Ubuntu install? Maybe we should rewrite this in a proper scripting language that has batteries included and also starts with P
