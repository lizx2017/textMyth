Summary:
Checks for coplanarity when creating polygons shows numerical issues
Description:
Coplanarity checks in GeoPolygonFactory shows numerical errors when the distance between two points is very small compared to the distance of the other two points. The situation is as follows:
Having three points A, B, & C and the distance between A & B is very small compared to the distance between A & C, then the plane AC contains all points (co-planar) but the plane defined by AB does not contain C because of numerical issues. This situation makes some polygons fail to build.
