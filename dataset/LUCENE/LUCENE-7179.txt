Summary:
GeoPoint and LatLonPoint test data should quantize once
Description:
LatLonPoint and GeoPointField tests pre quantizes test data to ensure consistency with indexed (encoded) data. The pre quantized data then becomes indexed, undergoing another quantization. To guarantee numerical stability this should be changed such that the test data is quantized after indexing.
