Summary:
StringHelper needs to catch NoClassDefFoundError
Description:
Problem:
As shown here, StringHelpers currently use Paths to generate random and catch Exception when resources are unavailable.
However, in some platform, calling Paths will result NoClassDefFoundError which is not handled by catching Exception.
Change:
Change to catch *Throwable* instead.
