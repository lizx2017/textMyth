Summary:
BasicOperations.concatenate creates invariants
Description:
I started writing a test for LUCENE-2716, and i found a problem with BasicOperations.concatenate(Automaton, Automaton):
it creates automata with invariant representation (which should never happen, unless you manipulate states/transitions manually).
strangely enough the BasicOperations.concatenate(List<Automaton>) does not have this problem.
