Summary:
binary packaging: lucene modules/contribs that depend on jars are confusing
Description:
In the binary release, i noticed lucene contribs (for example benchmark)
that rely upon jar files, don't include them, nor do they have a README telling
you they depend upon them, nor is there any hint they actually have any dependencies at all!
we should improve this either by including the jars you need or by including a README.txt telling you what a particular module/contrib depends upon.
