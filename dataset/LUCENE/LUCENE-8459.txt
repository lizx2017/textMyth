Summary:
Add SearcherTaxonomyManager constructor taking already opened readers
Description:
Today it either takes IndexWriter or Directory (and it opens its own DirectoryReader}}s) ... but I'd like to pass in my own reader so that e.g. I can use a {{FilterDirectoryReader.  This is useful e.g. for tracking fun low level stats like how many term dictionary lookups your queries are doing.
My first attempt was to do my wrapping in SearcherFactory, but SearcherManager gets angry when you do that ("SearcherFactory must wrap exactly the provided reader").
