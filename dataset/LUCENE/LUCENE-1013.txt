Summary:
IndexWriter.setMaxMergeDocs gives non-backwards-compatible exception "out of the box"
Description:
Yonik hit this (see details in LUCENE-994): because we have switched
to LogByteSizeMergePolicy by default in IndexWriter, which uses MB to
limit max size of merges (setMaxMergeMB), when an existing app calls
setMaxMergeDocs (or getMaxMergeDocs) it will hit an
IllegalArgumentException on dropping in the new JAR.
I think the simplest solution is to fix LogByteSizeMergePolicy to
allow setting of the max by either MB or by doc count, just like how
in LUCENE-1007 allows flushing by either MB or docCount or both.
