Summary:
SpanMultiTermQueryWrapper with Prefix Query issue
Description:
If we try to do a search with SpanQuery and a PrefixQuery this message is returned:
"You can only use SpanMultiTermQueryWrapper with a suitable SpanRewriteMethod."
The problem is in the WildcardQuery rewrite function.
If the wildcard query is a prefix, a new prefix query is created, the rewrite method is set with the SpanRewriteMethod and the prefix query is returned.
But, that's the rewritten prefix query which should be returned:
return rewritten;
+ return rewritten.rewrite(reader);
I will attach a patch with a unit test included.
