Summary:
LatLonShape: Within and disjoint queries donâ€™t work with indexed multishapes
Description:
Within and disjoint queries return wrong results (false positives) when querying for fields containing more than one shape. For example, a multipolygon will return true for a within query if some of the polygons are within and the other are disjoint. The same query will return true for disjoint.
