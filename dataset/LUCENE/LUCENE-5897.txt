Summary:
performance bug ("adversary") in StandardTokenizer
Description:
There seem to be some conditions (I don't know how rare or what conditions) that cause StandardTokenizer to essentially hang on input: I havent looked hard yet, but as its essentially a DFA I think something wierd might be going on.
An easy way to reproduce is with 1MB of underscores, it will just hang forever.
  public void testWorthyAdversary() throws Exception {
    char buffer[] = new char[1024 * 1024];
    Arrays.fill(buffer, '_');
    int tokenCount = 0;
    Tokenizer ts = new StandardTokenizer();
    ts.setReader(new StringReader(new String(buffer)));
    ts.reset();
    while (ts.incrementToken()) {
      tokenCount++;
    }
    ts.end();
    ts.close();
    assertEquals(0, tokenCount);
  }
