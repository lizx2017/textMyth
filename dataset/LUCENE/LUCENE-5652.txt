Summary:
JVM crash in RamUsageEstimator.measureObjectSize(Ljava/lang/Object;)
Description:
I hit this JVM crash when running Lucene's tests ... I was using the Python distributed tester (runRemoteTests.py in luceneutil), but I don't think that's the cause here. That test running just fires up randomizedtesting's SlaveMainSafe and feeds it tests to run.
