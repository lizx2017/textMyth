Summary:
IndexWriter can't handle old lucene inex format when opened with create mode
Description:
IndexWriter indexWriter = new IndexWriter(cacheDir,
new IndexWriterConfig(Version.LUCENE_41, englishAnalyzer).
setOpenMode(IndexWriterConfig.OpenMode.CREATE));
Fails with CorruptedIndex subclass, IndexTooOldException (or something like that), even though the config would just replace the files.
