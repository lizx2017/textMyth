Summary:
Hunspell shouldnt merge dictionary entries
Description:
Ive been writing lots of little unit tests for this thing, and I'm pretty positive i screwed this up in LUCENE-5468... sorry
Otherwise the whole "prefix-suffix dependencies" described in the manpage won't work.
Either 'words' should be changed from FST<Long> to FST<IntsRef>, or when there are duplicates we should add 'padding' that we just consume (suggester-style). The latter is a little tricky, but I think this is generally uncommon so it would keep the FST smaller.
shouldnt be hard to fix.
