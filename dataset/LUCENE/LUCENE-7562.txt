Summary:
CompletionFieldsConsumer throws NPE on ghost fields
Description:
If you index SuggestField for some field X, but later delete all documents with that field, it can cause a ghost situation where the field infos believes field X exists yet the postings do not.
I believe this bug is the root cause of this ES issue: https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/21500
