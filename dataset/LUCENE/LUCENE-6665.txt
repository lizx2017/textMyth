Summary:
I have a million /tmp/readonlyindexXXXX directories
Description:
I suspect this is from LUCENE-6542? Seems like it makes an index in my /tmp dir, but then never removes it? When I run distributed beasting ... this makes a lot of these
Seems like the test just needs an @AfterClass to remove its indexPath...
