Summary:
Stop IndexWriter from writing broken term vector offset data in 5.0
Description:
Today we allow this in (some analyzers are broken), and only reject them if someone is indexing offsets into the postings lists.
But we should ban this also when term vectors are enabled. Its time to stop writing this broken data and let broken analyzers be broken.
