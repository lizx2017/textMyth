Summary:
[PATCH] fix compile errors in sandbox
Description:
Here's a patch that fixes the compile problems in sandbox/analyzers starting
shortly before the 1.4 release. The deprecation warnings are also fixed. I
have not tested the changes (I don't use those analyzers) but the changes
should be trivial enough so they don't break anything.
Could someone apply the patch and also fix FrenchAnalyzer? It's the same
change as for the other files, but I didn't manage to make a clean diff
because of encoding problems.
