Summary:
Randomize lockfactories in tests
Description:
Today we don't do this, and it can be annoying for tests (see LUCENE-6507).
But we should randomize between NIO/Simple. LuceneTestCase can "remember" which ones have been assigned and prevent the issue of opening IW with NIO and then making a new dir over the same path with simple and confusing the test.
