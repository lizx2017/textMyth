Summary:
join on single-valued field with deleted docs scores too few docs
Description:
TermsIncludingScoreQuery has an inner class SVInnerScorer used when the "to" side of a join is single-valued. This has a nextDocOutOfOrder() method that is faulty when there are deleted documents, and a document that is deleted is matched by the join. It'll terminate with NO_MORE_DOCS prematurely. Interestingly, it appears MVInnerScorer (multi-valued) was coded properly to not have this problem.
