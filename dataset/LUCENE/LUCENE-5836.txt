Summary:
BytesRef.copyBytes and copyChars don't oversize
Description:
When copying data from another BytesRef/CharSequence, these methods don't oversize. This is not an issue if this method is used only once per BytesRef instance but I just reviewed the usage of these methods and they are very frequently used in loops to do things like:
keep track of the top values in comparators
keep track of the previous terms in various loops over a terms enum (lucene49 DV consumer, BlockTreeTermsWriter)
etc.
Although unlikely, it might be possible to hit a worst-case and to resize the underlying byte[] on every call to copyBytes? Should we oversize the underlying array in these methods?
