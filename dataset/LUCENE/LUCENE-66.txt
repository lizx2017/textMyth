Summary:
java.io.IOException on retrieving result
Description:
Doing load tests today, I started getting errors in the try block:
try
{
recordIndexes[i] = Integer.parseInt(hits.doc.get(LuceneIndexer.kRecordIndex));
scores[i] = hits.score;
}
"java.io.IOException: read past EOF"
I don't currently know how to reproduce this. Will follow up when I can.
