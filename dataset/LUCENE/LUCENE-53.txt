Summary:
Escaping special characters does not work
Description:
Searching for 73-21-QY-01 does not work unless I put the term inside quotes,
i.e., this does not work 73-21-QY-01. This could be related to the negative
number bug reported earlier, but even if I change the term to 73-A21-QY-B01, it
does not work.
