Summary:
Something wrong with how "File Formats" link is generated in docs/index.html - can cause precommit to fail on some systems
Description:
I'm not sure what's going on, but here's what I've figured out while poking at things with Ishan to try and figure out why ant precommit fails for him on a clean checkout of master...
on my machine, with a clean checkout, the generated index.html file has lines that look like this...
<li>
<a href="core/org/apache/lucene/codecs/lucene62
/package-summary.html#package.description">File Formats</a>: Guide to the supported index format used by Lucene.  This can be customized by using <a href="core/org/apache/lucene/codecs/package-summary.html#package.description">an alternate codec</a>.</li>
<li>
...note there is a newline in the href after lucene62
on ishan's machine, with a clean checkout, the same line looks like this...
<li>
<a href="core/org/apache/lucene/codecs/lucene62%0A/package-summary.html#package.description">File Formats</a>: Guide to the supported index format used by Lucene.  This can be customized by using <a href="core/org/apache/lucene/codecs/package-summary.html#package.description">an alternate codec</a>.</li>
<li>
...note that he has a URL escaped 'NO-BREAK SPACE' (U+00A0) character in href attribute.
on my machine, ant documentation-lint doesn't complain about the newline in the href attribute when checking links.
on ishan's machine, ant documentation-lint most certainly complains about the 'NO-BREAK SPACE'...
...

BUILD FAILED
Raising the following questions...
How is either a newline or a 'NO-BREAK SPACE' getting introduced into the $defaultCodecPackage variable that index.xsl uses to generate that href attribute?
why doesn't documentation-lint complain that the href has a newline in it on my system?
