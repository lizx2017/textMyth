Summary:
NumericUtils.getMinLong and NumericUtils.getMaxLong have undefined behavior when no docs have value - throw NPE
Description:
Tracked down a possible cause of SOLR-7866 to situations where a (numeric) field doesn't have any values in an index and you try to get the min/max.
javadocs for NumericUtils.getMinLong and NumericUtils.getMaxLong don't actually say what that method will do in this case, throw NPE when it happens
