Summary:
Hi David,
Description:
You just closed my previous ticket, because you thought it was a request for help.
Instead I'm just trying to understand why when I'm seeking a sequence of number (figures with eventually a decimal separator, like . or ,) using Lucene, it does not work.
If you agree on the fact that figures are kind of characters, this is definitely a bogue.
Thanks for your detailed answer.
Cheers,
