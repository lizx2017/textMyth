Summary:
Custom build.xml for binary distributions
Description:
The binary files of a distribution come with the demo sources
and a build.xml file. However, the build.xml doesn't work for
the binary distribution, so it can't be used to build the
demos.
This problem was notices the first time when release 2.1 was
made. Before we ship 2.2 we should fix this.
