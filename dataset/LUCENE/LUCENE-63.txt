Summary:
java.io.IOException: Timed out waiting for: Lock@D:\documentation\index\commit.lock
Description:
Our version is Lucene 1.2 RC4.
When executing a query we get the following error
java.io.IOException: Timed out waiting for:
Lock@D:\documentation\index\commit.lock
The directory above has full access to everyone.
Deleting the lock file and restarting the app didn't work.
However, it had worked earlier. I really don't know what has changed.
Any ideas?
