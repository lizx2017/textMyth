Summary:
Add boosting support in the SynonymQuery
Description:
The SynonymQuery tries to score multiple terms as if you had indexed them as one term.
This is good for "true" synonyms where each term should have the same contribution to the final score but this doesn't handle the case where terms have different weights. For scoring purpose it would be nice to be able to assign a boost per term that we could multiply with the term's document frequency in order to take into account the importance of the term within the synonym list.
