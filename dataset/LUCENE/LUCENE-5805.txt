Summary:
QueryNodeImpl.removeFromParent does a lot of work without any effect
Description:
The method removeFromParent of QueryNodeImpl, calls getChildren on the parent and removes any occurrence of "this" from the result.
However, since a few releases, getChildren returns a copy of the children list, so the code has no effect (except creating a copy of the children list which will then be thrown away).
Even worse, since setChildren calls removeFromParent on any previous child, setChildren now has a complexity of O(n^2) and creates a lot of throw-away copies of the children list (for nodes with a lot of children)
public void removeFromParent() {
    if (this.parent != null) {
      List<QueryNode> parentChildren = this.parent.getChildren();
      Iterator<QueryNode> it = parentChildren.iterator();
      
      while (it.hasNext()) {
        if (it.next() == this) {
          it.remove();
        }
      }
      
      this.parent = null;
    }
  }
