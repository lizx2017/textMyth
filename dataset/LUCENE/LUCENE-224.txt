Summary:
[PATCH] FilteredTermEnum code cleanup
Description:
FilteredTermEnum's constructor takes two parameters but doesn't use them. This
patch changes that and thus makes the code easier readable. Maybe the old
constructor should be kept (as deprecated)? I'm not sure, this version seems
cleaner to me.
