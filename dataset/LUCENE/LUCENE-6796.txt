Summary:
Some terms incorrectly highlighted in complex SpanQuery
Description:
Modassar Ather initially raised this on LUCENE-5205. I'm opening this as a separate issue.
If a SpanNear is within a SpanOr, it looks like the child terms within the SpanNear query are getting highlighted even if there is no match on that SpanNear query...in some special cases. Specifically, in the format of the parser in LUCENE-5205 "(b [c z]) d\"~2", which is equivalent to: find "b" or the phrase "c z" within two words of "d" either direction
This affects trunk.
