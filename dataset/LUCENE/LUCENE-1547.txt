It's an intermittant failure that only happens when multiple threads
are calling commit() at once. With autoComit=true and
ConcurrentMergeScheduler, this can happen more often because each
merge thread calls commit after it's done.
The problem happens when one thread has already begun the commit
process, but another two or more threads then come along wanting to
also commit after further changes have happened. Those two or more
threads would wait until the currently committing thread finished, and
then they'd wake up and do their commit. The problem was, after
waking up they would fail to check whether they had been superseded,
ie whether another thread had already committed more up-to-date
changes.
The fix is simple â€“ after waking up, check again if your commit has
been superseded, and skip your commit if so.
