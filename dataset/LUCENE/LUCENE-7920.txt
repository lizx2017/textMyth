Summary:
Make it easier to create ip prefix queries
Description:
InetAddress.getByAddress automatically transforms ipv6-mapped ipv4 addresses to ipv4 addresses. While this is usually desirable, it can make ip prefix query a bit trappy. For instance the following code:
InetAddressPoint.newPrefixQuery("a", InetAddress.getByName("::ffff:0:0"), 96);
throws an IAE complaining that the prefix length is invalid: illegal prefixLength '96'. Must be 0-32 for IPv4 ranges, 0-128 for IPv6 ranges.
