Summary:
GeoComplexPolygon fails when points are near identical
Description:
When a polygon have two consecutive points very close to each other but not numerically identical, we can get wrong results because planes defining that edge intersects somewhere else on the world. At that point the following check is evaluated to true:
if (edge.plane.evaluateIsZero(thePointX, thePointY, thePointZ) && edge.startPlane.isWithin(thePointX, thePointY, thePointZ) && edge.endPlane.isWithin(thePointX, thePointY, thePointZ)) {
  return false;
}
