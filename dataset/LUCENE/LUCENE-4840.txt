Summary:
SortedSetDocValuesFacetField doesn't work with DrillDownQuery
Description:
Currently SSDVFF does not index any postings ... so you cannot drill-down, at least not the "normal" way.
To fix this, we may need to make SSDVFF more like FacetFields, i.e. receive all CategoryPaths up front, and then re-use the code in FacetFields that adds the pre-tokenized field to the doc.
