Summary:
Already open IndexSearcher sees different DVs as commits are happening
Description:
I'm hitting an issue in SOLR-5944 whereby I am seeing the dvGen of a reader underlying an open searcher is changing when parallel commits are happening.
This happens when the reader is opened from a writer, but doesn't happen when the reader is opened directly from a directory.
Also, I think I am, in Solr, seeing differences in DVs when parallel threads make DV updates and do commits. In the attached test, I couldn't reproduce this scenario, though.
Questions:
1) Is it a bug, or by design, that the segment readers of an open indexsearcher has their dvGens changing? (as according to the test attached).
2) Is it possible, as I think it is happening in Solr's 5944, that the DV values themselves could change as a result of this parallel commit happening?
Apologies, if I should have asked this at the user mailing list, instead of opening an issue here.
