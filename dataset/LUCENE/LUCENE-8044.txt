Summary:
UAX_URL_EMAIL tokenizer not compliant to rfc1808
Description:
I noticed that the uax_url_email tokenizer splits urls in multiple tokens in presence of digits, ".", "-"
I opened a issue on elasticsearch github repo (https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/27309) because I noticed this strange behaviour.
Their answer was
The uax_url_email tokenizer tokenizes URLs and email addresses, but in order to recognize a token as a URL it must include the scheme (usually HTTP:// or https://):
Additionally, this tokenizer belongs to Lucene. Could you open this issue at https://lucene.apache.org/core/ instead?
URLs are defined by RFC1738 and extended by RFC1808.
In RFC1808 Relative URLs are explained, and this allows scheme-less URLs.
I would expect uax_url_email to tokenize correctly also scheme-less and relative URL.
