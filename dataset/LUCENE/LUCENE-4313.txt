Summary:
IntelliJ classpath doesn't include phonetic and morfologik resources/ directories
Description:
The .iml files generated by 'ant idea' for the phonetic and morfologik modules don't include src/resources as source paths. This means that the FilterFactory classes defined in these modules are not loaded by the lucene SPILoader, and consequently the example Solr instance used by various tests does not start.
