Summary:
Fix Disjunction*Scorer not to score unless you ask it to
Description:
These things scored implicitly on next()/advance() for historical reasons: but now that minShouldMatch is split apart we should remove this, its unnecessary.
This allows us to remove the horrendous afterNext and clean things up, too.
