Summary:
LRUQueryCache.onDocIdSetEviction should not be called when nothing is evicted
Description:
This method is confusing because it states it will be called "when one or more DocIdSets are removed from this cache" but may actually be called with zero docidsets when evicting a per-segment cache that did not contain any entries.
