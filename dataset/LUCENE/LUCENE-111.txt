Summary:
Too many files open error - when creating indexes for images
Description:
Hi,
We are using lucene search engine 1.2 to search for images in our imaging web
site .
Everytime we add a new image to the database, an index also get created based
on the image name and search keywords using lucene index creator.
We have around 180,000 images in the database, but after creating about 80,000
indexes, the upload program gives the following error:
"Too many files open". Cannot open the file "_yaf.tii"
Pls help us to resolve this matter?
Is there any limitation of files when creating the indexes?
Thanks & Best Regards
Ralani
