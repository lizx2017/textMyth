Summary:
[PATCH] Dutch Analyser
Description:
Dutch analyser for Lucene.
Original version for Lucene.Net by Edwin de Jonge
Analyzer for Dutch language. Supports an external list of
stopwords (words that will not be indexed at all), an external list of
exclusions (word that will not be stemmed, but indexed) and an external
list of word-stem pairs that overrule the algorithm (dictionary
stemming).
A default set of stopwords is used unless an alternative list is specified, the
exclusion list is empty by fault.
