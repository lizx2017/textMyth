Summary:
FunctionQuery.AllScorer.explain overwrites FunctionWeight.queryNorm in trappy fashion
Description:
FunctionQuery.AllScorer.explain is:
    public Explanation explain(int doc, float queryNorm) throws IOException {
      float sc = qWeight * vals.floatVal(doc);

      return Explanation.match(sc, "FunctionQuery(" + func + "), product of:",
          vals.explain(doc),
          Explanation.match(queryNorm, "boost"),
          Explanation.match(weight.queryNorm = 1f, "queryNorm"));
    }
The following line has a subtle assignment that overwrites weight.queryNorm.
          Explanation.match(weight.queryNorm = 1f, "queryNorm"));
Because weights aren't reused between search and explain this doesn't break anything but it's awfully subtle.
Seeing as queryNorm is ALWAYS 1 here, could we just drop this extra line from the explain output and use the following instead?
    public Explanation explain(int doc, float queryNorm) throws IOException {
      float sc = qWeight * vals.floatVal(doc);

      return Explanation.match(sc, "FunctionQuery(" + func + "), product of:",
          vals.explain(doc),
          Explanation.match(queryNorm, "boost"));
    }
