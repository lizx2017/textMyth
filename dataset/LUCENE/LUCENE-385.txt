Summary:
[PATCH] don't delete all files in index directory on index creation
Description:
Many people use Lucene to index a part of their file system. The chance that
you some day mix up index directory and document directory isn't that bad.
Currently Lucene will delete all files in the index directory when the
create paramater passed to IndexWriter is true, thus deleting your documents
if you mixed up the parameters. I'll attach a patch that fixes
this. Any objections?
