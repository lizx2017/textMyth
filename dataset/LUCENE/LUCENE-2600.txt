Summary:
don't try to cache a composite reader's MultiBits deletedDocs
Description:
MultiFields.getDeletedDocs now builds up a MultiBits instance (so that one can check if a top-level docID is deleted), but it now stuffs it into a private cache on IndexReader.
This is invalid when the composite reader is read/write, and can result in a MultiReader falsely claiming a doc was not deleted.
