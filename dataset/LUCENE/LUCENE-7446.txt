Summary:
Fix back-compat version check in addVersion helper script
Description:
As part of the 5.5.3 post-release process, I was trying to bump up the number to 5.5.4 on the release branch but ran into the following error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "dev-tools/scripts/addVersion.py", line 246, in <module>
    main()
  File "dev-tools/scripts/addVersion.py", line 221, in main
    if current_version.is_back_compat_with(c.version):
  File "/Users/anshumgupta/workspace/lucene-solr/dev-tools/scripts/scriptutil.py", line 75, in is_back_compat_with
    raise Exception('Back compat check disallowed for newer version: %s < %s' % (self, other))
Exception: Back compat check disallowed for newer version: 5.5.3 < 5.5.4
I think the check is wrong and should be reversed. I'll post a patch that I used to work around this but would be good to have more eyes on this before I commit this.
Steve Rowe: Can you take a look at the patch as I guess you added this recently.
