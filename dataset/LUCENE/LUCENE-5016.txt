Summary:
Sampling can break FacetResult labeling
Description:
When sampling FacetResults, the TopKInEachNodeHandler is used to get the FacetResults.
This is my case:
A FacetResult is returned (which matches a FacetRequest) from the StandardFacetAccumulator. The facet has 0 results. The labelling of the root-node seems incorrect. I know, from the StandardFacetAccumulator, that the rootnode has a label, so I can use that one.
Currently the recursivelyLabel method uses the taxonomyReader.getPath() to retrieve the label. I think we can skip that for the rootNode when there are no children (and gain a little performance on the way too?)
