Summary:
Expression SortField has crappy toString/bad equals/hashcode
Description:
While doing some unrelated debugging:
I noticed when printing the Sort, the expressions get the inherited toString for a CUSTOM comparator, which is not very good:
<custom:"sqrt(_score) + ln(popularity)": null>!
I think its better if it looks something like this instead:
<expr "sqrt(_score) + ln(popularity)">!
Also equals/hashcode is wrong: it will bogusly report equals(true) if the expression is the same: but bindings could be different!
