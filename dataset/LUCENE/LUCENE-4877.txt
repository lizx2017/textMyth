Summary:
Fix analyzer factories to throw exception when arguments are invalid
Description:
Currently if someone typos an argument "someParamater=xyz" instead of someParameter=xyz, they get no exception and sometimes incorrect behavior.
It would be way better if these factories threw exception on unknown params, e.g. they removed the args they used and checked they were empty at the end.
