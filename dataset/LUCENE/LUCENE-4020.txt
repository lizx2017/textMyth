Summary:
Tests may not be repeatable across different platforms/ JVMs due to different locale/ timezone being picked.
Description:
This is because the source array can be/ is different for each system/ JVM. So this pick is not repeatable for example:
  /** 
   * Return a random Locale from the available locales on the system.
   */
  public static Locale randomLocale(Random random) {
    Locale locales[] = Locale.getAvailableLocales();
    return locales[random.nextInt(locales.length)];
  }
I don't think there is much we can do to make it repeatable (other than maybe enforcing locale using system property).
