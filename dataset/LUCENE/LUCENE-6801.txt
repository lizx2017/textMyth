Summary:
PhraseQuery incorrectly advertises it supports terms at the same position
Description:
The following in PhraseQuery has been here since Sept 15th 2004 (by "goller"):
    /**
     * Adds a term to the end of the query phrase.
     * The relative position of the term within the phrase is specified explicitly.
     * This allows e.g. phrases with more than one term at the same position
     * or phrases with gaps (e.g. in connection with stopwords).
     * 
     */
    public Builder add(Term term, int position) {
Of course this isn't true; it's why we have MultiPhraseQuery. Yet we even allow you to have consecutive terms with the same positions. We shouldn't allow that; we should throw an exception. For my own sanity, I modified a simple MultiPhraseQuery test to use PhraseQuery instead and of course it didn't work.
