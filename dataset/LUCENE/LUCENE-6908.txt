Summary:
TestGeoUtils.testGeoRelations is buggy with irregular rectangles
Description:
The .testGeoRelations method doesn't exactly test the behavior of GeoPoint*Query as its using the BKD split technique (instead of quad cell division) to divide the space on each pass. For "large" distance queries this can create a lot of irregular rectangles producing large radial distortion error when using the cartesian approximation methods provided by GeoUtils. This issue improves the accuracy of GeoUtils cartesian approximation methods on irregular rectangles without having to cut over to an expensive oblate geometry approach.
