Summary:
Deprecate CachingWrapperQuery
Description:
I propose that we deprecate CachingWrapperQuery in favour of LRUQueryCache. I think the latter is much more convenient as
caching will happen automatically when scores are not needed and filters are reused
it allows to configure a maximum ram budget
it doesn't require to insert a Query object in the query tree that might prevent to simplify some queries via rewriting
