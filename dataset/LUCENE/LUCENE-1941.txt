Summary:
MinPayloadFunction returns 0 when only one payload is present
Description:
In some experiments with payload scoring through PayloadTermQuery, I'm seeing 0 returned when using MinPayloadFunction. I believe there is a bug there. No time at the moment to flesh out a unit test, but wanted to report it for tracking.
