Summary:
ant nightly-smoke fails in trunk
Description:
I don't know the last time this was run by jenkins, but:
   [smoker] Verify...
   [smoker]   confirm all releases have coverage in TestBackwardsCompatibility
   [smoker]     find all past Lucene releases...
   [smoker]     run TestBackwardsCompatibility..
   [smoker] Releases that don't seem to be tested:
   [smoker]   4.10.4
And i don't see any unsupported-4.10.4-cfs/nocfs.zip in the backwards-codec/ module (to test we do the right thing), so I think the failure is correct. I will fix this a little bit later if nobody beats me to it.
