Summary:
Search does not return results that it should
Description:
I have a database which I index and it works perfectly fine when indexing.
However, when I search, it doesn't bring up all the results it should.
For instance, there are 10 entries with the word "Dog"
but when I search for "Dog" it returns only 5.
Then, I reindexed, but then it got worse. When I searched it return 4 and it
were 4 that were different then the 5 that were previously returned.
What am I missing? Why doesn't it return the results properly?
