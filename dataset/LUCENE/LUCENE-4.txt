Summary:
QueryParser does not recognized negative numbers...
Description:
The TermQuery allows .setBost to set a float multiplier. The boost is entered
via a '^'<NUMBER> format in the String query, however, while .setBoost will
take a negative number, the parser does not allow negative numbers due to the
limited description of the <NUMBER> token (QueryParser.jj):
<NUMBER: (<_NUM_CHAR>)+ "." (<_NUM_CHAR>)+ >
The solution is to allow + or - as in:
<NUMBER: (["+","-"])? (<_NUM_CHAR>)+ "." (<_NUM_CHAR>)+ >
This works correctly, properly reading negative numbers.
I have done some simple tests, and negative boost seems to work as expected, by
moving the entry to the end of the list.
