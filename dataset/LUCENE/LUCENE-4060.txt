Summary:
DirectoryTaxonomyWriter.addTaxonomies does not work well in a multi-threaded environment
Description:
DirTaxoWriter.addTaxonomies may lead to a corrupt taxonomy index if addCategory is called in parallel. While reviewing the code, the following changes seemed to be required:
Fix the bug
Simplify addTaxonomies code â€“ it's very complicated, seems rather inefficient, and seems to take care of more than is needed.
The intention to support multiple taxonomies is unclear, especially since FacetsPayloadProcessor can handle only one Directory and one OrdinalMap at a time. So I'd like to change the method to addTaxonomy. I anyway don't see the reason to add multiple taxonomies at once, one can call addTaxonomy several times.
I will post a patch soon.
