Summary:
org.apache.lucene.ant.HtmlDocument creates a FileInputStream in its constructor that it doesn't close
Description:
A look through the jtidy source code doesn't show a close that i can find in parse (seems to be standard that you close your own streams anyway), so this looks like a small descriptor leak to me.
