Summary:
[PATCH] HTMLParser doesn't parse hexadecimal character references
Description:
I recently inherited a project from an ex-colleague; it uses Lucene and in
particular the HTML Parser. I've found that she had made an amendment to the
parser to allow it to parse and decode hexadecimal character references, which
we depend on, but had not reported a bug. If she had, someone might have
pointed out that her correction was wrong ...
I don't seem to be able to attach the (fairly trivial) patch to an initial bug
report (and in any case I've failed to find the instructions for generating a
diff file in the right format, even though I'm sure I've seen it somewhere).
