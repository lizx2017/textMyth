Summary:
LRUQueryCache.onQueryCache is always called with null as first parameter
Description:
According to the javadocs, LRUQueryCache.onQueryCache can be used to track usage statistics on cached queries. Unfortunately, due to a bug, the query parameter is always passed as null, making the method practically useless.
