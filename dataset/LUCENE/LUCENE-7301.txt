Summary:
updateNumericDocValue mixed with updateDocument can cause data loss in some randomized testing
Description:
SOLR-5944 has been held up by a while due to some extremely rare randomized test failures.
Ishan and I have been working on whitling those Solr test failures down, trying to create more isolated reproducable test failures, and i think i've tracked it down to a bug in IndexWriter when the client calls to updateDocument intermixed with calls to updateNumericDocValue AND IndexWriterConfig.setMaxBufferedDocs is very low (i suspect "how low" depends on the number of quantity/types of updates â€“ but just got something that reproduced, and haven't tried reproducing with higher values of maxBufferedDocs and larger sequences of updateDocument / updateNumericDocValue calls.
