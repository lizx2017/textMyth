Summary:
sort while using MultiSearcher
Description:
I am using MultiSearcher search multi index directory, want to sort by INDEX
ORDER.
In search() method, scoreDocs has been merged into hq and the doc id changed to
a global value.
But ,when into FieldDocSortedHitQueue.lessThan(): i found in "SortField.DOC"
case, the value used to compare comes from "((Integer)docA.fields[i]).intValue
()" which is not the global value just given (docA.doc).
So, the comparision and the sort combine the results from multi index directory
without gloabl order.
WHY?
i don't found other interfaces to solve it, so the sort result is wrong.
