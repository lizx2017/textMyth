Summary:
CartesianPolyFilterBuilder doesn't handle edge case around the 180 meridian
Description:
Test case:
Points all around the globe, plus two points at 0, 179.9 and 0,-179.9 (on each side of the meridian). Then, do a Cartesian Tier filter on a point right near those two. It will return all the points when it should just return those two.
The flawed logic is in the else clause below:
if (longX2 != 0.0) {
  //We are around the prime meridian
  if (longX == 0.0) {
   longX = longX2;
   longY = 0.0;
         shape = getShapeLoop(shape,ctp,latX,longX,latY,longY);
  } else {//we are around the 180th longitude
   longX = longX2;
   longY = -180.0;
   shape = getShapeLoop(shape,ctp,latY,longY,latX,longX);
 }
Basically, the Y and X values are transposed. This currently says go from longY (-180) all the way around to longX which is the lower left longitude of the box formed. Instead, it should go from the lower left long to -180.
