Summary:
Bring back TFIDFSim.lengthNorm
Description:
We removed this before because of LUCENE-2828,
but the problem there was the delegator (not the lengthNorm method).
TFIDFSim requires byte[] norms today. So its computeNorm should be final,
calling lengthNorm() that returns a byte.
This way there is no possibility for you to do something stupid.
