Summary:
SimpleFSLockFactory ignores error on deleting the lock file
Description:
Spinoff from here:
http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/lucene/java-user/54438
The Lock.release for SimpleFSLockFactory ignores the return value of lockFile.delete(). I plan to throw a new LockReleaseFailedException, subclassing from IOException, when this returns false. This is a very minor change to backwards compatibility because all methods in Lucene that release a lock already throw IOException.
