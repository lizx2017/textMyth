Summary:
add a system property to allow testing of suspicious stuff
Description:
there are times when people want to add assumptions in test to prevent confusing/false failures in certain situations (eg: known bugs in JVM X, known incompatibilities between lucene feature Z and filesystem Y, etc...)
By default we want these situations to be "skiped" in tests with clear messages so that it's clear to end users trying out releases that these tests can't be run for specific sitautions.
But at the same time we need a way for developers to be able to try running these tests anyway so we know if/when the underliyng problem is resolved.
i propose we add a "tests.suspicious.shit" system property, which defaults to "false" in the javacode, but can be set at runtime to "true"
assumptions about things like incompatibilities with OSs, JVM vendors, JVM versions, filesystems, etc.. can all be dependent on this system propery.
