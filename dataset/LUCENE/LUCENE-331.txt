Summary:
MultiFieldQueryParser.parse("foo[", ... ) throws ParseException
Description:
MultiFieldQueryParser.parse(query, searchFields, analyzer)
throws a parse exception when the query string holds a '['; for example 'foo['.
I'm not a Lucene expert but would guess that this is a string Lucene should be
able to search for. Could someone please let me known if this expected behaviour
or a bug?
Thanks,
Nick
