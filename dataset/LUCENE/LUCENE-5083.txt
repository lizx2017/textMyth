Summary:
Wasted work in FuzzySet.getNearestSetSize
Description:
The problem appears in version 4.3.1 and in revision 1498027. I
attached a two-line patch that fixes it.
In method "FuzzySet.getNearestSetSize", the loop over
"usableBitSetSizes" keeps overriding "result" with
"usableBitSetSizes[i]". Therefore, only the last written value is
visible out of the loop and all the other writes and iterations are
not necessary. The patch iterates from the end of "usableBitSetSizes"
and breaks the first time when "result" is set.
