Summary:
2.1 Locking documentation in "Apache Lucene - Index File Formats" section "6.2 Lock File" out dated
Description:
I am in the process to migrate from Lucene 2.0 to Lucene 2.1.
From reading the Changes document I understand that the write locks are now written into the index folder instead of the java.io.tmpdir.
In the "Apache Lucene - Index File Formats" document in section "6.2 Lock File" I read that there is a write lock used to indicate that another process is writing into the index and that this file is stored in the java.io.tempdir.
This is confusing to me. I had the impression all lock files go into the index folder now. And using the the java.io.tempdir is only local and does not support access to shared index folders.
Do I miss something here or is the documentation not updated?
