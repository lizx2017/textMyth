Summary:
CheckIndex prints wrong version number on 3.1 indexes (and posibly also in trunk)
Description:
When you run CheckIndex on an index created/updated with 3.1, it prints about the SegmentInfos:
Segments file=segments_g19 numSegments=5 version=-11 [Lucene 1.3 or prior]
We should fix CheckIndex and also verify other cases where version numbers are printed out. In trunk the issue may be more complicated!
