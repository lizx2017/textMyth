Summary:
IndexWriter#updateDocValues can break index sorting
Description:
IndexWriter#updateDocValues can break index sorting if it is called on a field that is used in the index sorting specification.
TestIndexSorting has a test for this case: #testConcurrentDVUpdates
but only L1 merge are checked. Any LN merge would fail the test because the inner sort of the segment is not re-compute during/after DV updates.
