Spun off of SOLR-4373: as discsused with uwe on IRC, NamedSPILoader.reload is not thread safe: it reads from this.services at the beginging of hte method, makes additions based on the method input, and then overwrites this.services at the end of the method. if the method is called by two threads concurrently, the entries added by threadB could be lost if threadA enters the method before threadB and exists the method after threadB
