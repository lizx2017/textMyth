Summary:
BooleanQuery scores can be diff for same docs+sim when using coord (disagree with Explanation which doesn't change)
Description:
Some of the folks reported that sometimes explain's score can be different than the score requested by fields parameter. Interestingly, Explain's scores would create a different ranking than the original result list. This is something users experience, but it cannot be re-produced deterministically.
