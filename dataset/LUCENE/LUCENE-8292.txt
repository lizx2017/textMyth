Summary:
Fix FilterLeafReader.FilterTermsEnum to delegate all seekExact methods
Description:
FilterLeafReader#FilterTermsEnum wraps another TermsEnum and delegates many methods.
It misses some seekExact() methods, thus it is not possible to the delegate to override these methods to have specific behavior (unlike the TermsEnum API which allows that).
The fix is straightforward: simply override these seekExact() methods and delegate.
