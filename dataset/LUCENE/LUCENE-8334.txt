Summary:
Ensure SR#getSementInfo() returns snapshot
Description:
The SegmentCommitInfo passed to the segment reader is mutated concurrently.
An instance obtained from SR#getSegmentInfo() might return wrong delete counts
or generation ids. This ensures that the SR will use a clone internally while stil
maintaining the original SI since it's needed inside IW for maintainance like
accessing pooled readers etc.
