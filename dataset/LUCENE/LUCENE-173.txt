Summary:
[Patch] Corrected HighFreqTerms
Description:
I had a problem running HighFreqTerms in lucene-sandbox, due to an
arrayoutofboundexception (there was a > where a >= was needed or something).
It also appeared to me that the code could be simplified by using the insert
method of PQ (which is also faster than push/pop).
