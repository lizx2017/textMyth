Summary:
Vector.isNumericallyIdentical() can produce unexpected results
Description:
The method Vector.isNumericallyIdentical() seems to produce wrong results in some cases. For example it considers that vectors (1,0,0) and (-1,0,0) are numerically identical whichI is probably wrong.
This behavior might produce unexpected behaviors down the line.
