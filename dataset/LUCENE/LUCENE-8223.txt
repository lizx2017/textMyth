Summary:
CachingNaiveBayesClassifierTest.testPerformance() fails on slow machines
Description:
The 7.3 Jenkins smoke tester has failed a couple of times due to CachingNaiveBayesClassifierTest.testPerformance() (see https://builds.apache.org/job/Lucene-Solr-SmokeRelease-7.3/9/ for example).
I don't think performance tests like this are very useful as part of the standard test suite, because they depend too much on what else is happening on the machine they're being run on.
