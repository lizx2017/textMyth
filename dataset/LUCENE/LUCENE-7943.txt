Summary:
Plane.findArcDistancePoints() sometimes throws assertion failures even when plane explicitly normalized
Description:
The following assertion sometimes fails even when the plane has been explicitly normalized:
    assert Math.abs(x*x + y*y + z*z - 1.0) < MINIMUM_RESOLUTION_SQUARED : "Plane needs to be normalized";
I can find nothing wrong with the assertion check, but the numerical accuracy is 1e-16, which just isn't high enough to support MINIMUM_RESOLUTION_SQUARED accuracy (1e-24).
