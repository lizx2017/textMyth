Summary:
Wierd behavior when searching plurals
Description:
I have a simple collection containing 6 documents, each document has a field
category. The values for this field are:
Wine
Wines
Grape
Grapes
Cheese
Cheeses
If I search category for wines, I return one hit (wines). If I search for
wine, I return 2 hits (wine, wines). I see the same behavior with grape and
grapes. When I search for cheeses, I return one hit (cheeses). But when I
search for cheese, I also return one hit (cheese). I expected 2 hits (cheese,
cheeses). I can not explain this behavior. Is there an explanation for this
behavior or is this a bug?
I'm using the standard analyzer and query parser. I first saw this behavior
in my application that implements Lucene. So, I used the Luke application to
search my collection and found the same behavior. I used Luke to peek into my
collection, but found what I expected, nothing unusual in the collection.
Any insight greatly appreciated.
