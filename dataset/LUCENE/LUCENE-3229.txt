Summary:
SpanNearQuery: ordered spans should not overlap
Description:
While using Span queries I think I've found a little bug.
With a document like this (from the TestNearSpansOrdered unit test) :
"w1 w2 w3 w4 w5"
If I try to search for this span query :
spanNear([spanNear([field:w3, field:w5], 1, true), field:w4], 0, true)
the above document is returned and I think it should not because 'w4' is not after 'w5'.
The 2 spans are not ordered, because there is an overlap.
I will add a test patch in the TestNearSpansOrdered unit test.
I will add a patch to solve this issue too.
Basicaly it modifies the two docSpansOrdered functions to make sure that the spans does not overlap.
