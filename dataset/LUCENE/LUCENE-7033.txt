Summary:
ant prepare-release-no-sign fails intermittently
Description:
Mike reported this on the mailing list. This is fully reproducible, you just need to run it twice:
cd lucene
# succeeds
ant prepare-release-no-sign
# fails
ant prepare-release-no-sign
The problem is with this target that runs conditionally:
  <target name="-unpack-lucene-tgz" unless="lucene.tgz.unpack.dir.exists">
    <antcall target="-ensure-lucene-tgz-exists" inheritall="false">
      <propertyset refid="uptodate.and.compiled.properties"/>
    </antcall>
    <mkdir dir="${lucene.tgz.unpack.dir}"/>
    <untar compression="gzip" src="${lucene.tgz.file}" dest="${lucene.tgz.unpack.dir}">
      <patternset refid="patternset.lucene.solr.jars"/>
    </untar>
  </target>
I attach a diff from the two runs â€“ you can see the second one skipped this task and then cleaned the output folder, which doesn't make sense.
I don't know how to fix, but I think it's this.
