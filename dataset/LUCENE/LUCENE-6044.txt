Summary:
Add backcompat for TokenFilters with posInc=false before 4.4
Description:
In Lucene 4.4, a number of token filters supporting the enablePositionIncrements=false setting were changed to default to true. However, with Lucene 5.0, the setting was removed altogether. We should have backcompat for this setting, as well as work when used with a TokenFilterFactory and match version < 4.4.
