Summary:
Old segments not deleted on merge
Description:
After a full rebuild with the dataimport handler on a Solr install upgraded to Solr 4.9.0, I ended up with an index that was considerably larger than the one it replaced (built by 4.7.2), 28GB instead of 20GB. I also upgraded a third-party component at the same time, to a version which has been tested with Solr 4.9.0. The config didn't change at all. Optimizing the index did not shrink it.
At first I thought there must have been something different about the way the new version worked, or possibly a change/bug in the third-party component.
After looking deeper, I discovered that the optimization process had created one segment that was 20GB in size, but there were also a number of other segments on the disk, all of which were several hours older than the large segment. Another optimize created a new segment of 20GB, and the previous segment of 20GB was deleted, but the older segments remained.
