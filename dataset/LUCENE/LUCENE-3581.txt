Summary:
IndexReader#isCurrent() should return true on a NRT reader if no deletes are applied and only deletes are present in IW
Description:
I keep forgetting about this, I better open an issue. If you have a NRT reader without deletes applied it should infact return true on IR#isCurrent() if the IW only has deletes in its buffer ie. no documents where updated / added since the NRT reader was opened. Currently if there is a delete coming in we force a reopen which does nothing since deletes are not applied anyway.
