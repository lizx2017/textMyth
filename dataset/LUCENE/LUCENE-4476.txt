Summary:
maven deployment scripts dont work (except from the machine you made the RC from)
Description:
Currently the maven process described in http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/PublishMavenArtifacts does not work (on mac)
It worked fine for the 4.0-alpha and 4.0-beta releases.
NOTE: This appears to be working on linux so I am going with that. But this seems strange it doesnt work on mac.
