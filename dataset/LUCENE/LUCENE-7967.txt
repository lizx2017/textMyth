Summary:
GeoDegeneratePoint in Pole
Description:
Hi Karl Wright,
This a small thing that shows up during the effort of integrating the library with Spatial4J. if we have a degenerated point in the pole and you create a point in the pole, it can happen that the new point is not within the degenerated point.
I attach a test case.
Thanks,
I.
