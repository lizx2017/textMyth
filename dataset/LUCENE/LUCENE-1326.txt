Summary:
Inflater.end() method not always called in FieldsReader
Description:
We've just found an insidious memory leak in our own application as we did not always call Deflater.end() and Inflater.end(). As documented here;
http://bugs.sun.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=4797189
The non-heap memory that the native zlib code uses is not freed in a timely manner.
FieldsWriter appears safe as no exception can be thrown between the Deflater's creation and end() as it uses a ByteArrayOutputStream
FieldsReader, however, is not safe. In the event of a DataFormatException the call to end() will not occur.
