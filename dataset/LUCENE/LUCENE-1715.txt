Summary:
DirectoryIndexReader finalize() holding TermInfosReader longer than necessary
Description:
DirectoryIndexReader has a finalize method, which causes the JDK to keep a reference to the object until it can be finalized. SegmentReader and MultiSegmentReader are subclasses that contain references to, potentially, hundreds of megabytes of cached data in a TermInfosReader.
Some options would be removing finalize() from DirectoryIndexReader (it releases a write lock at the moment) or possibly nulling out references in various close() and doClose() methods throughout the class hierarchy so that the finalizable object doesn't references the Term arrays.
