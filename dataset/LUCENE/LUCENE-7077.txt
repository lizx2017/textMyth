Summary:
fail precommit on useless assignment
Description:
I found LUCENE-7073 because of a compiler warning in my IDE. It slipped all the way through buggy tests too! I think we should fail when "assignment has no effect", rather than just rely on someone to catch it visually.
This is very specific and will not trigger a bunch of false positives: but can indicate a common bug in e.g. constructors for POJO classes and so on.
