Summary:
CheckIndex API changed without backwards compaitibility
Description:
The API of CheckIndex changed. The Check function returns a CheckIndexStatus and not boolean. And JavaDocs notes the boolean return value.
I am not sure if it works, but it would be good to have the check method that returns boolean available @Deprecated, i.e.
@Deprecated public static CheckIndexStatus check(Directory dir, boolean doFix) throws IOException {
final CheckIndexStatus stat=this.check(dir,doFix);
return stat.clean;
}
I am not sure, if it can be done with the same method name, but it prevents drop-in-replacements of Lucene to work.
