Summary:
Deadlock case in IndexWriter on exception just before flush
Description:
If a document hits a non-aborting exception, eg something goes wrong
in tokenStream.next(), and, that document had triggered a flush
(due to RAM or doc count) then DocumentsWriter will deadlock because
that thread marks the flush as pending but fails to clear it on
exception.
I have a simple test case showing this, and a fix fixing it.
