Summary:
Kuromoji fails with UnsupportedOperationException in case of duplicate keys in the user dictionary
Description:
Failing is the right thing to do but the exception could clarify the source of the problem. Today it just throws an UnsupportedOperationException with no error message because of a call to PositiveIntOutputs.merge.
