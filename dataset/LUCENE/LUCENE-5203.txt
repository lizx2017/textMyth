Summary:
WordDelimiterFilter stemEnglishPossessive option does not work for Tokens ending with a digit
Description:
For Token ending with "
{digit}
's" the WordDelimiterFilter ignores the stemEnglishPossessive configuration
e.g. in the text "SD500's poor underwater performance" the "'s" will not be stemmed from SD500 even if stemEnglishPossessive="1".
The reason is that "WordDelimiterIterator#endsWithPossessive(int pos)" checks for
isAlpha(charType(text[pos - 3]))
while it should also allow for isDigits(int type).
