Summary:
SloppyPhraseScorer sometimes misses documents that ExactPhraseScorer finds.
Description:
The general bug is a case where a phrase with no slop is found,
but if you add slop its not.
I committed a test today (TestSloppyPhraseQuery2) that actually triggers this case,
jenkins just hasn't had enough time to chew on it.
ant test -Dtestcase=TestSloppyPhraseQuery2 -Dtests.iter=100 is enough to make it fail on trunk or 3.x
