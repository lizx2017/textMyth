Summary:
HyphenationCompoundWordTokenFilter returns terms shorter than minSubwordSize
Description:
To account for languages which use binding characters ("fogemorphemes") for composing words the HyphenationCompoundWordTokenFilter re-checks the dictionary for a candidate with the last character removed when the original candidate was not found. It currently does not re-check against minSubWordSize in this case. Terms that are one character shorter than minSubWordSize can be returned.
