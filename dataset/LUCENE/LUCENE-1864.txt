Summary:
bogus javadocs for FieldValueHitQuery.fillFields
Description:
FieldValueHitQuery.fillFields has javadocs that seem to be left over from a completely different method...
  /**
   * Given a FieldDoc object, stores the values used to sort the given document.
   * These values are not the raw values out of the index, but the internal
   * representation of them. This is so the given search hit can be collated by
   * a MultiSearcher with other search hits.
   * 
   * @param doc
   *          The FieldDoc to store sort values into.
   * @return The same FieldDoc passed in.
   * @see Searchable#search(Weight,Filter,int,Sort)
   */
  FieldDoc fillFields(final Entry entry) {
    final int n = comparators.length;
    final Comparable[] fields = new Comparable[n];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      fields[i] = comparators[i].value(entry.slot);
    }
    //if (maxscore > 1.0f) doc.score /= maxscore;   // normalize scores
    return new FieldDoc(entry.docID, entry.score, fields);
