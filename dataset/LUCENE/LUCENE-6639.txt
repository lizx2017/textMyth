Summary:
LRUQueryCache.CachingWrapperWeight not calling policy.onUse() if the first scorer is skipped
Description:
The method org.apache.lucene.search.LRUQueryCache.CachingWrapperWeight.scorer(LeafReaderContext) starts with
if (context.ord == 0) {
    policy.onUse(getQuery());
}
which can result in a missed call for queries that return a null scorer for the first segment.
