Summary:
Optimize NumericAttributeFactory
Description:
Followup from LUCENE-5638: NumericTokenStream has its own factory, wrapping AttributeFactory.DEFAULT_ATTRIBUTE_FACTORY.
Currently it gets no speedup from the change, but I think it could (I saw speedups for even StringField from that change)
It has 3 attributes: NumericTermAttribute, posIncr, and type. Maybe the NumericTermAttributeImpl should also implement posIncr and type?
