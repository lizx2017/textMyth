Summary:
Mixed case and keyword fields don't mix?
Description:
Forgive me if this is expected behavior, but I can't find it cited anywhere...
Using Lucene 1.3-rc1, I indexed a document (with StandardAnalyzer) with a
keyword field "member" and a value "testOwner". I then attempted to retrieve
that document via the query "member:testOwner", and I got zero results. I was
able to retrieve the document via another query (against another field) and saw
that Lucene had correctly stored "testOwner" as the value of "member".
So, I puttered around with other queries. The following queries work:
member:test?wner
member:test*
The following queries do not work:
member:testOwner
member:testowner
member:testO*
member:testO?ner
If I switch my index to make the member field be stored instead of keyword,
searching on member:testOwner works fine. So, something about having a
mixed-case value for a keyword field fails on the query. That surprised me,
since keyword fields are untokenized â€“ if anything, I'd've expected keyword to
handle mixed-case better.
In case it matters, this is J2SE build 1.4.0_01-ea-b02 on Windows 2000.
Thanks!
