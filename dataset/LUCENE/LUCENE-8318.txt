Summary:
The dest file might be deleted later by FSDirectory#rename
Description:
When renaming a file, `FSDirectory#rename` tries to delete the dest file if it's in the pending deletes list. If that delete fails, it adds the dest to the pending deletes list again. This causes the dest file to be deleted later by `deletePendingFiles`.
This was introduced by LUCENE-8275.
