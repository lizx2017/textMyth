Summary:
CheckIndex.checkIndex throws IndexNotFoundException: no segments* file found in RAMDirectory@
Description:
I am testing upgrade from Lucene 4.1 to 5.2.1 and found that behavior of CheckIndex.checkIndex() changed. We used the following to create status for empty dir (we use it for some reporting purpose):
CheckIndex.Status status = new CheckIndex(new RAMDirectory()).checkIndex();
At 5.2.1 it throws:
org.apache.lucene.index.IndexNotFoundException: no segments* file found in RAMDirectory@51f090da lockFactory=org.apache.lucene.store.SingleInstanceLockFactory@8b6023d: files: []
at org.apache.lucene.index.CheckIndex.checkIndex(CheckIndex.java:487)
at org.apache.lucene.index.CheckIndex.checkIndex(CheckIndex.java:466)
I expect that it should returns status with cantOpenSegments flag on. https://lucene.apache.org/core/5_2_1/core/org/apache/lucene/index/CheckIndex.Status.html#cantOpenSegments
Is it expected behavior?
If this isn't expected, I am willing to provide a fix (should be minor) that I could figure out on it how to contribute.
