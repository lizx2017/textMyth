Summary:
Spell checker puts a hard 3-letter limit on indexed words which affects suggestions
Description:
SVN r1055285 (committed for LUCENE-2391) introduced a hard limit on the minimum length required before including a word in the spell checker. This not only shows all 2-letter words as misspelled/not existing (unless the caller agrees that 2-letter words should not be checked for spelling) but 2-letter suggestions will never show up in a call to suggestSimilar(). It would be nice to have this limit reduced or, ideally, not hard-coded.
