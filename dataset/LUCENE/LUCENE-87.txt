[PATCH] GermanAnalyzer problems with upper/lower case
Description:
Hello!
If noticed some strange problems of the german analyzer when using field search
for texts consisting of more than one word. For example, I had to documents in
the search index, one had a field set to "Anfrage von mir", the other one had
it set to "Ticket von mir". While the search for "fieldname:anfrage" returned
the expected document, "fieldname:ticket" did not return the document. After
removing the special treatment of upper case words in the GermanStemmer, it
worked properly.
All the best
Philipp
