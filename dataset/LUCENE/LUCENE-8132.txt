Summary:
HyphenationDecompoundTokenFilter does not set position/offset attributes correctly
Description:
HyphenationDecompoundTokenFilter and DictionaryDecompoundTokenFilter set positionIncrement to 0 for all subwords, reuse start/endoffset of the original token and ignore positionLength completly.
In consequence, the QueryBuilder generates a SynonymQuery comprising all subwords, which should rather treated as individual terms.
