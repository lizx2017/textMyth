Summary:
intermittant exceptions in TestConcurrentMergeScheduler
Description:
The TestConcurrentMergeScheduler throws intermittant exceptions that
do not result in a test failure.
The exception happens in the "testNoWaitClose()" test, which repeated
tests closing an IndexWriter with "false", meaning abort any
still-running merges. When a merge is aborted it can hit various
exceptions because the files it is reading and/or writing have been
deleted, so we ignore these exceptions.
The bug was just that we were failing to properly check whether the
running merge was actually aborted because of a scoping issue of the
"merge" variable in ConcurrentMergeScheduler. So the exceptions are
actually "harmless". Thanks to Ning for spotting it!
