Summary:
Documentation is incorrect for org.apache.lucene.misc.SweetSpotSimilarity
Description:
The documentation for SweetSpotSimilarity says that you can configure a global min/max and also a min/max per field, however at looking at the source and just trying to accomplish this it looks as though it's not possible. Is that correct?
I looked into using SchemaSimilarityFactory as a global Similarity and then using SweetSpotSimilarity on a fieldType, but was not able to configure the min and max values. Is there a way to accomplish that without writing my own SweetSpotSimilarityFactory?
Thanks.
