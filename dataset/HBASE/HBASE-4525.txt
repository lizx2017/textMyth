Summary:
HBase always run with default hadoop setting.
Description:
When we build the hbase, we can say which version of hadoop we want to build with.
For example:
mvn -DskipTests=true package
mvn -Dhadoop.profile=22 -DskipTests=true package
However during the runtime, bin/hbase scripts will call add_maven_deps_to_classpath, which will always add the default hadoop version(0.20-append) to classpath (targets/cached_classpath.txt).
