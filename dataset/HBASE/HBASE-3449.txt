Summary:
Server shutdown handlers deadlocked waiting for META
Description:
I have a situation where both of my MASTER_META_SERVER_OPERATIONS handlers are handling server shutdowns, and both of them are waiting on ROOT, which isn't coming up. Unclear exactly how this happened, but I triggered it by doing a rolling restart.
