Summary:
TestHTablePool failing after recent commit of HConnection changes
Description:
TestHTablePool passes a null Configuration to HTablePool causing a new NPE. It should just reuse the TEST_UTIL.conf.
Could also add a check to HTablePool that conf is not null but seems that it should make sense that you can't pass it null?
