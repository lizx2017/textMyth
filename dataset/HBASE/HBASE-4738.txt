Summary:
[89-fb] HBaseAdmin has ambiguous varargs invocations
Description:
Ambiguous invocations of varargs methods with non-varargs arguments relied on the compiler to implicitly cast the arguments to Object[]. Some compilers apparently do not make this implicit cast, but instead wrap the arguments in another Object[] causing them to be interpreted incorrectly.
