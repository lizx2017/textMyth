Summary:
PerformanceEvaluation "--nomapred" may assign duplicate random seed over multiple testing threads
Description:
When you use PerformanceEvaluation with "--nomapred" option, you will end up having the same random seeds assigned over multiple testing threads. So you'll get inaccurate results from "random~~" tests.
PerformanceEvaluation.java
542:  abstract class Test {
543:     protected final Random rand = new Random(System.currentTimeMillis());
Milliseconds won't be sufficient; today's JVM is much faster to create multiple Test objects in one millisecond. You might want to use something like "super.hashCode()" instead.
