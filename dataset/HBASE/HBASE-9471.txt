Summary:
htrace synchronized on getInstance
Description:
When doing tests on cached data, one of the bottleneck is the getInstance() on HTrace, called in RequestContext#set() --> Trace.isTracing()
When it's fixed, we see threads blocked in sendResponse and in the metrics (with hadoop 1).
The difference is not huge (it's in the range 0-5%), but there is no reason to keep this.
I'm sending a pull request to htrace.
