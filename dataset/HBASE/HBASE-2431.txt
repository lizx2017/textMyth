Summary:
ZK settings for initLimit/syncLimit shouldn't have been removed from hbase-default.xml
Description:
The initLimit/syncLimit ZK settings were removed from hbase-default.xml as part of HBASE-2392 (upgrade to ZK 3.3).
But these settings are needed. Without them, if you try to start a ZK quorum of more than 1 server, you'll get the following error:
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: initLimit is not set
at org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.QuorumPeerConfig.parseProperties(QuorumPeerConfig.java:246)
at org.apache.hadoop.hbase.zookeeper.HQuorumPeer.main(HQuorumPeer.java:76)
