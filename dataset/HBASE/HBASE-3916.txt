Summary:
Fix problem with default bind address of ThriftServer
Description:
The command line help states that when no -b bind address is given it uses 0.0.0.0. That is not the case though:
     InetAddress listenAddress = null;
     if (cmd.hasOption("bind")) {
       try {
         listenAddress = InetAddress.getByName(cmd.getOptionValue("bind"));
       } catch (UnknownHostException e) {
         LOG.error("Could not bind to provided ip address", e);
         printUsageAndExit(options, -1);
       }
     } else {
       listenAddress = InetAddress.getLocalHost();
     }
The latter is not 0.0.0.0 but the current IP:
beanshell% InetAddress.getLocalHost()
de1-app-mbp-2/10.0.0.65
So we either need to change the command line help or set the address to 0.0.0.0 instead.
