Summary:
Scanners opened on regions that have multiple uncompacted storefiles and/or memcache do not produce the correct values
Description:
As I was investigating HBASE-532, I became suspicious that scanners suffer from problems similar to those that getFull and getClosest suffered before. Namely, when there are multiple stores per columnfamily for a region (memcache and 1+ stofiles, empty memcache and 2+ storefiles), incorrect answers are produced. I will attach a test case that showcases this problem.
