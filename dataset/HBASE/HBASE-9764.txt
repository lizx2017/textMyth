Summary:
htable AutoFlush is hardcoded as false in PerformanceEvaluation
Description:
In PerformanceEvaluation, htable AutoFlush option is hardcoded as false
PerformanceEvaluation.java
    void testSetup() throws IOException {
      this.admin = new HBaseAdmin(conf);
      this.table = new HTable(conf, tableName);
      this.table.setAutoFlush(false);
      this.table.setScannerCaching(30);
    }
This makes the write performace unreal.
Should we add an autoflush option in PerformanceEvaluation?
