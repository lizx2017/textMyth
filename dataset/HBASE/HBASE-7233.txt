Summary:
Serializing KeyValues over RPC
Description:
Undo KeyValue being a Writable.
This issue wandered and became general discussion of KeyValue serialization, in particular, how to pass lots of KeyValues across rpc. It was noticed that what we were passing over the wire for KeyValues was not protobuf'd KeyValues but the old serialization which assumes the KeyValue version 1 format. After a bunch of good discussion working out rpc formats, was decided to close this issue in favor of more specific issues: see summary at https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-7233?focusedCommentId=13573259&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13573259
