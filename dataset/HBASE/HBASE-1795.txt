Summary:
log recovery doesnt reset the max sequence id, new logfiles can get tossed as 'duplicates'
Description:
during log recovery, we dont reset Store.maxSeqId, thus new log entries are stamped starting off from the old files. This can cause a problem if we fail and recover again, since the new mutations are deemed "old" and shouldnt be applied in a subsequent recovery scenario.
