Summary:
TestAcidGuarantees system test should flush more aggressively
Description:
HBASE-5887 allowed TestAcidGuarantees to be run as a system test by avoiding the call to util.flush().
It would be better to go through the HBaseAdmin interface to force flushes. This would unify the code path between the unit test and the system test, as well as forcing more frequent flushes, which have previously been the source of ACID guarantee problems, e.g. HBASE-2856.
