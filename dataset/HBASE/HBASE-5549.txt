Summary:
Master can fail if ZooKeeper session expires
Description:
There is a retry mechanism in RecoverableZooKeeper, but when the session expires, the whole ZooKeeperWatcher is recreated, hence the retry mechanism does not work in this case. This is why a sleep is needed in TestZooKeeper#testMasterSessionExpired: we need to wait for ZooKeeperWatcher to be recreated before using the connection.
This can happen in real life, it can happen when:
master & zookeeper starts
zookeeper connection is cut
master enters the retry loop
in the meantime the session expires
the network comes back, the session is recreated
the retries continues, but on the wrong object, hence fails.
