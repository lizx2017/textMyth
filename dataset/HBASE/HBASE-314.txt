Summary:
Clean up warnings, visibility and javadoc issues in HBase
Description:
We (Michael Stack and I) have turned on warnings in eclipse for almost everything.
Whenever a class is changed, its visibility, method visibility, internal class visibility, etc. should be examined and javadoc that is incorrect or missing parameters, return values or exceptions thrown should be cleaned up.
