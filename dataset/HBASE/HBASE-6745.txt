Summary:
Always flush region based on memstore size could hold hlog files from archiving
Description:
Currently, memstore flusher always chooses the biggest memstore region to flush.
Suppose I have two tables: one is very actively updated, while the other is periodically updated. The active one has biggest memstore all the time and is flushed all the time. But the in-active one never gets a chance to flush. Since it is not flushed, the hlog file can't be archived, although there are lots of hlog files.
If the active table happens to have big updates all the time, the hlog files could cause huge disk space pressure.
Other than the memstore size, periodically flushing regions based on hlog roll time is helpful in hlog archiving/replication.
