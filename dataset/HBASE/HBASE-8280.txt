Summary:
Add a dummy test to check build env
Description:
trunk seems to be built on machines named ubuntu*
precommit is on machines named hadoop*
Looking at java.home on these machines, we have:
hadoop1: /home/jenkins/tools/java/jdk1.6.0_27/jre
hadoop2: /home/jenkins/tools/java/jdk1.6.0_26/jre
hadoop3: /home/jenkins/tools/java/jdk1.6.0_26/jre
hadoop4: /home/jenkins/tools/java/jdk1.6.0_26/jre
hadoop5: /home/jenkins/tools/java/jdk1.6.0_26/jre
hadoop6: /home/jenkins/tools/java/jdk1.6.0_26/jre
ubuntu1: /home/jenkins/jenkins-slave/jdk/jre version: 1.6.0_16-b01
ubuntu2: no reply
ubuntu3: /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk-amd64/jre version: 1.6.0_27-b27
ubuntu4: /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk-amd64/jre version: 1.6.0_27-b27
ubuntu5: no reply
ubuntu6: /home/jenkins/jenkins-slave/jdk/jre version: 1.6.0_16-b01
The build logs says:
[PreCommit-HBASE-Build] $ /bin/bash /tmp/hudson6507498537145712977.sh
asf002.sp2.ygridcore.net
Linux asf002.sp2.ygridcore.net 2.6.32-33-server #71-Ubuntu SMP Wed Jul 20 17:42:25 UTC 2011 x86_64 GNU/Linux
/tmp/hudson6507498537145712977.sh: line 4: java: command not found
=> We try to get the java version, fails, but the build will continue anyway, and succeeds.
On ubuntu, we have
+ java -version
java version "1.6.0_32"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_32-b05)
=> Seems good. But it's this one that fails.
Now, the fact that the java -version fails on the precommit makes me wonder if we don't use the version installed by default. Hence, we would use a random and often the openjdk one when we build the trunk.
This patch will help us to understand our build env.
