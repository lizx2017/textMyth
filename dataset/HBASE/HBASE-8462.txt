Summary:
Custom timestamps should not be allowed to be negative
Description:
Client supplied timestamps should not be allowed to be negative, otherwise unpredictable results will follow. Especially, since we are encoding the ts using Bytes.Bytes(long), negative timestamps are sorted after positive ones. Plus, the new PB messages define ts' as uint64.
Credit goes to Huned Lokhandwala for reporting this.
