Summary:
Can't start REST/Thrift server if HBASE_JMX_OPTS not set
Description:
By default JMX is enabled for REST server and Thrift server. However, if HBASE_JMX_OPTS is not set, and JMX remote access rule is not set, we can't bring up the REST/Thrift server due to JMX remote access rule errors.
We need to enhance the hbase script not to enable JMX for REST/Thrift server is HBASE_JMX_OPTS is not set.
