Summary:
Admin actions that use MetaReader to iterate regions need to skip offline ones
Description:
If a table has offline regions in META then clients using HBaseAdmin actions like #flush or #compact will get a NSRE and abort. For example the shell. This can happen normally after a split before the old parent is collected.
