Summary:
Holding an HConnection open through an hbase restart doesn't work
Description:
I have a java tools server that uses some hbase client functionality (it is a servlet: in doGet I create a new HTable and call HTable.get). However, if I restart hbase, then subsequent hbase calls take forever. To fix it, I have to restart my java tools server.
I suspect it is caching the old location of .META., and can't deal with the cache being wrong.
