Summary:
The logic used in waiting for region servers during startup is broken
Description:
See the tail of HBASE-4993, which I'll report here:
Me:
I think a bug was introduced here. Here's the new waiting logic in waitForRegionServers:
the 'hbase.master.wait.on.regionservers.mintostart' is reached AND
there have been no new region server in for
'hbase.master.wait.on.regionservers.interval' time
And the code that verifies that:
!(lastCountChange+interval > now && count >= minToStart)
Nic:
It seems that changing the code to
(count < minToStart ||
lastCountChange+interval > now)
would make the code works as documented.
If you have 0 region servers that checked in and you are under the interval, you wait: (true or true) = true.
If you have 0 region servers but you are above the interval, you wait: (true or false) = true.
If you have 1 or more region servers that checked in and you are under the interval, you wait: (false or true) = true.
