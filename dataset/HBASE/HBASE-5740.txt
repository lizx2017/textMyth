Summary:
Compaction interruption may be due to balacing
Description:
Currently, the log shows
Aborting compaction of store LOG in region .... because user requested stop.
But it is actually because of balancing.
Currently, there is no way to figure out who closed the region. So it is better to change the message to say it is because of user, or balancing.
