Summary:
Web UI shows 0 region assigned but they are in the log
Description:
Seen on a 4 node cluster during the reduce phase of a MR job that only deleteAll rows, one of the region server failed after a filesystem not available exception. When restarted, it got assigned some regions but in the web UI none was shown when clicking on the HRS address. Also in the master page 0 region was shown for that HRS so the total number of regions was under the real number.
