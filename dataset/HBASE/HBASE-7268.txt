Summary:
correct local region location cache information can be overwritten (or deleted) w/stale information from an old server
Description:
Discovered via HBASE-7250; related to HBASE-5877.
Test is writing from multiple threads.
Server A has region R; client knows that.
R gets moved from A to server B.
B gets killed.
R gets moved by master to server C.
~15 seconds later, client tries to write to it (on A?).
Multiple client threads report from RegionMoved exception processing logic "R moved from C to B", even though such transition never happened (neither in nor before the sequence described below). Not quite sure how the client learned of the transition to C, I assume it's from meta from some other thread...
Then, put fails (it may fail due to accumulated errors that are not logged, which I am investigating... but the bogus cache update is there nonwithstanding).
I have a patch but not sure if it works, test still fails locally for yet unknown reason.
