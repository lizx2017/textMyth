Summary:
Fix the TestBatchedUpload Test to handle region movements because of load balancer
Description:
The testBatchedUploadWithRegionMoves might fail sometimes if the load
balancer kicks-in during the endBatchedUpload() call. During this call
while fetching the flush times of the regions on the regionservers, if
the region location changes, it throws an exception.
