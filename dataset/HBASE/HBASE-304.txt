Summary:
[hbase] Change abort to finalize; does nothing if commit ran successfully
Description:
From Michael Bieniosek:
I'm trying to do an update row, so I write code like:

long lockid = table.startUpdate(new Text(article.getName())); try {
     for (File articleInfo: article.listFiles(new NonDirectories())) {          articleTable.put(lockid, columnName(articleInfo.getName()), readFile(articleInfo));     }
     table.commit(lockid);
} finally {
    table.abort(lockid);
}

This doesn't work, because in the normal case it calls abort after commit.  But I'm not sure what the code should be, eg.:

long lockid = table.startUpdate(new Text(article.getName())); try {
     for (File articleInfo: article.listFiles(new NonDirectories())) {          articleTable.put(lockid, columnName(articleInfo.getName()), readFile(articleInfo));     }
     table.commit(lockid);
} catch (IOException e) {
    table.abort(lockid);
    throw e;
} catch (RuntimeException e) {
    table.abort(lockid);
    throw e;
}

This gets unwieldy very quickly.  Could you maybe change abort() to finalize() which either aborts or does nothing if a commit was successful?
