Summary:
InterruptedException still swallowed at many places

There was this Bug-Report (HBASE-2791), which was dismissed as 'redone in the master rewrite'. But for the InterruptedException nothing has changed.
InterruptedException is swallowed or wrapped in other Exceptions at many places, which is just not right. Please read this.
