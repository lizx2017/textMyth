Summary:
HFileDataBlockEncoderImpl#diskToCacheFormat uses wrong format
Description:
In this method, we have
    if (block.getBlockType() == BlockType.ENCODED_DATA) {
      if (block.getDataBlockEncodingId() == onDisk.getId()) {
        // The block is already in the desired in-cache encoding.
        return block;
      }
This assumes onDisk encoding is the same as that of inCache. This is not true when we change the encoding of a CF. This could be one of the reasons I got data loss with online encoding change?
If I make sure onDisk == inCache all the time, my ITBLL with online encoding change worked once for me.
