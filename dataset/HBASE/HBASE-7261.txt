Summary:
batchMutate/put release the same lock twice
Description:
Put uses batchMutate to do the actual work. Put calls startRegionOperation/closeRegionOperation. BatchMutate does the same. If the same thread already holds the lock, lock it again doesn't increase the lock count.
However, releasing lock is a little different. If the lock is already released, IllegalMonitorStateException will throw if it is released again.
There could be other calls. I will look into it more.
