Summary:
src assembly does not include hbase-hadoop2-compat module
Description:
The src.xml assembly under hbase-assembly does not include the hbase-hadoop2-compat (more joys of maven â€“ uses default profile which is hadoop1 when making module set so we have to do perverse include of the hbase-hadoop2-compat).
