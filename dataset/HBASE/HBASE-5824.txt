Summary:
HRegion.incrementColumnValue is not used in trunk
Description:
on 0.94 a call to client.HTable#incrementColumnValue will cause HRegion#incrementColumnValue. On trunk all calls to HTable.incrementColumnValue got to HRegion#increment.
My guess is that HTable#incrementColumnValue and HTable#increment serialize to the same thing over the wire so that the remote HRegionServer no longer knows which htable method was called.
To repro I checked out trunk and put a break point in HRegion#incrementColumnValue and then ran TestFromClientSide. The breakpoint wasn't hit.
