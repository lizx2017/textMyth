Summary:
Polish the migration to 0.96
Description:
Currently, migration works but there's still a couple of rough edges:
HBASE-8045 finished the .META. migration but didn't remove ROOT, so it's still on the filesystem.
Data in ZK needs to be removed manually. Either we fix up the data in ZK or we delete it ourselves.
TestMetaMigrationRemovingHTD has a testMetaUpdatedFlagInROOT method, but ROOT is gone now.
Elliott was also mentioning that we could have "hbase migrate" do the HFileV1 checks, clear ZK, remove ROOT, etc.
