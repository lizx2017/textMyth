Summary:
More log pruning
Description:
This issue covers some tightening up of log messages; as is all of the zk noise tends to overwhelm.
For example, zkwatcher logs a generic "This event happened in zk with path X and event type Y" but just after, there will be a log from the handler of this zk event with this subsequent log more descriptive. This change would make zkwatcher log at INFO by default rather than DEBUG cutting down on logging content (re-enabling DEBUG is easy to do if needed).
