Summary:
hbase.hlog.split.skip.errors is false by default but we don't act properly when its true; can make for inconsistent view
Description:
So, by default hbase.hlog.split.skip.error is false so we should not be skipping errors (What should we do, abort?).
Anyways, see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-3674. It has checksum error on near to last log BUT it writes out recovered.edits gotten so far. We then go and assign the regions anyways, applying edits gotten so far, though there are edits behind the checksum error still to be recovered. Not good.
