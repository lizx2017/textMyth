Summary:
Remove some synchronisation points in HConnectionManager
Description:
Change a Map to a concurrentMap
Removed the "cachedServer (introduced in HBASE-4785). I suspect that this function is not needed anymore as we also have a list of dead servers, and accessing the list is not blocking. I will dig into this more however.
The patch gives a 10% improvement with the NoClusterClient.
