Summary:
scanners need to obey row locks, a modest propsal
Description:
15:54 < dj_ryan> - next:
15:54 < dj_ryan> do next on Tree in memstore get rowid
15:55 < dj_ryan> acquire read lock on rowid (wait if necessary)
15:55 < dj_ryan> snapshot the entire row worth of data from memstore into scanner
15:55 < dj_ryan> release read lock on rowid
15:56 < dj_ryan> so if we get an insert on a row after the 'do next' which would call 'next' on the
previous last value grabbed from the tree
15:56 < dj_ryan> we'd skip that one
15:56 < dj_ryan> which is fine
15:57 < dj_ryan> i guess the issue comes in when you have to next a bunch to get to the next row
15:57 < dj_ryan> but that is doable with a simple little while loop
15:57 < dj_ryan> this only applies to memstore
15:57 < dj_ryan> snapshot = hfile
15:57 < dj_ryan> since its immutable
