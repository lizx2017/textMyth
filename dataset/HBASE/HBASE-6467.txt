Summary:
ROOT stuck in assigning forever
Description:
After restart a cluster, all region servers checked into master but the master stuck in assigning forever.
Master log shows it keeps trying connect to one region server for ROOT table, while that region server's log shows it keeps printing out NotServingRegionException.
After restart the master, things are ok now.
