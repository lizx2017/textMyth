Summary:
HRS.multi eats NoSuchColumnFamilyException since HBASE-5021
Description:
I think this is a pretty major usability regression, since HBASE-5021 this is what you get in the client when using a wrong family:
2012-09-11 09:45:29,634 WARN org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.RetriesExhaustedWithDetailsException: Failed 1 action: DoNotRetryIOException: 1 time, servers with issues: sfor3s44:10304, 
 at org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.HConnectionManager$HConnectionImplementation.processBatchCallback(HConnectionManager.java:1601)
 at org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.HConnectionManager$HConnectionImplementation.processBatch(HConnectionManager.java:1377)

 at org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.HTable.doPut(HTable.java:772)
 at org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.HTable.put(HTable.java:747)
Then you have to log on the server to understand what failed.
Since everything is now a multi call, even single puts in the shell fail like this.
This is present since 0.94.0
Assigning to Elliott because he asked.
