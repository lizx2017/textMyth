Summary:
hbase contrib javadoc on apache.org
Description:
Currently javadoc for hbase contrib does not show up anywhere at lucene.apache.org/hadoop.
Below is some discussion from hadoop-dev list on how to do the hbase contrib javadoc build.
From: Doug Cutting <cutting@apache.org>
Subject: Re: javadoc for hbase on apache.org
I'd vote for including it as we have other contrib documentation, as a
separate section in the main javadoc tree.
