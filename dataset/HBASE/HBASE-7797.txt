Summary:
Use consistent package name
Description:
This has been discussed here: http://search-hadoop.com/m/bXxiV1MGsYi2.
We should not release 0.96 with two namespaces. This will cause further pain and confusion in the future (like log4j configuration, greping logs, etc).
As much as I like it, I don't see us going o.a.hbase namespace, so let's move the Cell, and prefix tree classes to o.a.hadoop.hbase.
