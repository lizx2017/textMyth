Summary:
Update o.a.h.h.mapreduce package documentation
Description:
So far I've found two issues:
Listing the tests jar before the conf directory in the CLASSPATH means that the test directory's hbase-site.xml is picked up, which has 21810 as the port for ZK, not 2181 (as in hbase-default.xml)
Guava must be added to the CLASSPATH
