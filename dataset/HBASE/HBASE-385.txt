Summary:
[hbase] lock_id in HTable.startUpdate and commit/abort is misleading and useless
Description:
In the past, the lock id returned by HTable.startUpdate was a real lock id from a remote server. However, that has been superceeded by the BatchUpdate process, so now the lock id is just an arbitrary value. More, it doesn't actually add any value, because while it implies that you could start two updates on the same HTable and commit them separately, this is in fact not the case. Any attempt to do a second startUpdate throws an IllegalStateException.
Since there is no added functionality afforded by the presence of this parameter, I suggest that we overload all methods that use it to ignore it and print a deprecation notice. startUpdate can just return a constant like 1 and eventually turn into a boolean or some other useful value.
