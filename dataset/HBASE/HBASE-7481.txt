Summary:
Allow IOExceptions to be thrown from Filter methods
Description:
Currently there is no way to throw custom IOExceptions from any of the filter methods.
For implementers of custom filters that presents a problem.
For example there are scenarios where the filter would want to indicate to the client that there it should not retry. Currently there is no way of doing that.
