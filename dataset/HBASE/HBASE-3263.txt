Summary:
Stack overflow in AssignmentManager
Description:
My test cluster experienced a switch outage earlier this week which threw the master into a really bad state. In the catch clause of AssignmentManager.assign, we recurse, and if all of the region servers are inaccessible, we do so until we get a stack overflow.
