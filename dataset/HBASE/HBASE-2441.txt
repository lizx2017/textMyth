Summary:
ZK failures early in RS startup sequence cause infinite busy loop
Description:
If the RS loses its ZK session before it reports for duty, the abort() call will trigger an NPE, and then the stop boolean doesn't get toggled. The RS will then loop forever trying to register itself in the expired ZK session, and fill up the logs.
