Summary:
Client is not getting UnknownScannerExceptions; they are being eaten
Description:
This was reported by mudphone on IRC and confirmed by myself in quick test. If the client takes too long going back to the RS, the RS will throw an UnknownScannerException but it doesn't get back to the client. Instead, the client scan silently ends. Marking this blocker. Its actually in 0.20.4. Thats what I was testing. Mayhaps an RC sinker?
