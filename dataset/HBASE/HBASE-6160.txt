Summary:
META entries from daughters can be deleted before parent entries
Description:
HBASE-5986 fixed and issue, where the client sees the META entry for the parent, but not the children. However, after the fix, we have seen the following issue in tests:
Region A is split to -> B, C
Region B is split to -> D, E
After some time, META entry for B is deleted since it is not needed anymore, but META entry for Region A stays in META (C still refers it). In this case, the client throws RegionOfflineException for B.
