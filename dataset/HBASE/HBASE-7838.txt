Summary:
HBase regionserver never stops when running `hbase-daemon.sh stop regionserver`
Description:
Currently running full stack (Hadoop + Hbase + zookeeper) on a VM I want to reboot, every services stopped but HBase regionserver. For 2 days now, it's aligning dots on the console ...
I propose a timeout (default 600 overidable by $HBASE_STOP_TIMEOUT) to force kill -9 on the process.
