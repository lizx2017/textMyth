Summary:
[IHBASE] Idx Expression functionality is incompatible with SingleColumnValueFilter
Description:
Idx comparison expressions should have 1:1 mapping to SingleColumnValueFilter.
Without this mapping users can't fully use the index expressions to optimize their scan performance.
Currently there are two main features lacking:
Support for a != (NEQ) operator
Support for the 'filterIfMissing' modifier
