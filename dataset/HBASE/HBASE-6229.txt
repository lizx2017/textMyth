Summary:
AM.assign() should not set table state to ENABLED directly.
Description:
In case of assign from EnableTableHandler table state is ENABLING. Any how EnableTableHandler will set ENABLED after assigning all the the table regions. If we try to set to ENABLED directly then client api may think ENABLE table is completed. When we have a case like all the regions are added directly into META and we call assignRegion then we need to make the table ENABLED. Hence in such case the table will not be in ENABLING or ENABLED state.
