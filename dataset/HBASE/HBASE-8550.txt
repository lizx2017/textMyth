Summary:
0.94 ChaosMonkey grep for master is too broad
Description:
As a true anarchist, ChaosMonkey in 0.94 knows no masters, so it tries to kill all of them ("grep master"). If HBase user doesn't have enough permissions, some of the kills fail (in one case, Postfix master), and the entire command throws an exception; thus HBASE-7844 happens and the entire restart-master action fails, with master already killed, and not restarted.
In trunk, "proc_" was added to process and the grep filter, but in 94 it was deemed to break compat. We need to add something like "grep hbase" there.
