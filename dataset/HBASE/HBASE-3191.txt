Summary:
FilterList with MUST_PASS_ONE and SCVF isn't working
Description:
In a special case the FilterList with MUST_PASS_ONE operator doesn't work correctly:
a filter in the list is a SingleColumValueFilter with filterIfMissing=true
FilterList.filterKeyValue(KeyValue) is called
SingleColumValueFilter.filterKeyValue(KeyValue) is called
SingleColumValueFilter.filterKeyValue(KeyValue) returns ReturnCode.INCLUDE if the KeyValue doesn't match a column (to support filterIfMissing)
FilterList.filterKeyValue(KeyValue) immediately returns ReturnCode.INCLUDE, remaining filters in the list aren't evaluated.
However it is required to evaluate remaining filters, otherwise filterRow() filters out rows in case the filter's filterKeyValue() saves state that is used by filterRow(). (SingleColumValueFilter, SkipFilter, WhileMatchFilter do so)
