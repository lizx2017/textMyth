Summary:
SplitLogManager should reassign tasks even on a clean RS shutdown.
Description:
SplitLogManager does not reassign tasks if the regionserver does a clean
shutdown. We should reassign the task even if there is a clean shutdown.
This is a problem if the shutting down RS is the 3rd splitlog worker. Master
just sits there in a loop waiting for the task to finish, as the timeout
will not reassign the task any further.
