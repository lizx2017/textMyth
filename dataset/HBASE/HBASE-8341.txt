Summary:
RestoreSnapshotHandler.prepare() is not called by SnapshotManager and TakeSnapshotHandler should first acquire the table lock
Description:
In HBASE-7848, we added table lock to enabled/disabled snapshot handlers, and fixed SnapshotManager to call CloneSnapshotHandler.prepare() in HBASE-7957. It seems that we overlooked the RestoreSnapshotHandler.prepare(). In this issue we should fix that so that we acquire the table lock in restore snapshot.
There is also a slightly related issue where TakeSnapshotHandler first loads the HTD, then acquires the table lock. The order should be swapped to guard against concurrent alter table statements.
