Summary:
REST client (RemoteHTable) doesn't support binary row keys
Description:
The REST server doesn't seem to support using binary (MD5 for example) row keys. I believe the root cause of this is the use of Bytes.toBytes() in the RowSpec.parseRowKeys() method. Based on the use of Bytes.toStringBinary() within RemoteHTable.buildRowSpec(), I believe the converse function Bytes.toBytesBinary() should be used for row key parsing in RowSpec.parseRowKeys().
I also noticed that the RemoteHTable.buildRowSpec() method isn't URL encoding the row key, which is a mismatch to the logic in RowSpec.parseRowKeys() which performs URL decoding for both the start and stop row keys.
