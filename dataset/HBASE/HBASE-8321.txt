Summary:
Log split worker should heartbeat to avoid timeout when the hlog is under recovery
Description:
Currently, hlog splitter could spend quite sometime to split a log in case any HDFS issue and recoverLease/retry opening is needed. If distributed log split manager times out the log worker, other log worker to take over will run into the same issue.
Ideally, we should not need a timeout monitor. Since we have a timeout monitor for DSL now, the worker should heartbeat to avoid wrong/unneeded timeouts.
