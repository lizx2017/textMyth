Summary:
tautology in HRegionInfo.readFields
Description:
In HRegionInfo.readFields() the following looks wrong to me
} else if (getVersion() == VERSION)
{ it is always true. Should it have been }
else if (getVersion() == version) {
version is a local variable where the deserialized-version is stored.
(I am struggling with another issue where after applying some patches - including "HBASE-4388 Second start after migration from 90 to trunk crashes" my version of hbase-92 HRegionInfo.readFields() tries to find HTD in HRegionInfo and fails)
