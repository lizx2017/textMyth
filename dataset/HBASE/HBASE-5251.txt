Summary:
Some commands return "0 rows" when > 0 rows were processed successfully
Description:
From the hbase shell, I see this:
hbase(main):049:0> scan 't1'
ROW COLUMN+CELL
r1 column=f1:c1, timestamp=1327104295560, value=value
r1 column=f1:c2, timestamp=1327104330625, value=value
1 row(s) in 0.0300 seconds
hbase(main):050:0> deleteall 't1', 'r1'
0 row(s) in 0.0080 seconds <====== I expected this to read "2 row(s)"
hbase(main):051:0> scan 't1'
ROW COLUMN+CELL
0 row(s) in 0.0090 seconds
I expected the deleteall command to return "1 row(s)" instead of 0, because 1 row was deleted. Similar behavior for delete and some other commands. Some commands such as "put" work fine.
Looking at the ruby shell code, it seems that formatter.footer() is called even for commands that will not actually increment the number of rows reported, such as deletes. Perhaps there should be another similar function to formatter.footer(), but that will not print out @row_count.
