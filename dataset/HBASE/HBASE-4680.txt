Summary:
FSUtils.isInSafeMode() checks should operate on HBase root dir, where we have permissions
Description:
The HDFS safe mode check workaround introduced by HBASE-4510 performs a FileSystem.setPermission() operation on the root directory ("/") when attempting to trigger a SafeModeException. As a result, it requires superuser privileges when running with DFS permission checking enabled. Changing the operations to act on the HBase root directory should be safe, since the master process must have write access to it.
