Summary:
Migration to 0.20 looses index information from HTableDescriptor
Description:
In 0.19 index info was stored as a private field, and written specially in the Writable impl of HTD. In 0.20 it is stored in the general values map under the key "INDEXES". So migration needs to read in the old HTD format, and store the indexes in the values map. I wrote a quick standalone thing to do this. Can someone point me where to plug this into general migration process?
