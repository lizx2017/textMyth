Summary:
disable and drop of table is flakey still
Description:
Just now, cheddar up on IRC had table of 2k regions. A disable and drop gave him 2k rows in meta of historian info. He couldn't progress. Had to make below script for him:
meta = HTable.new(".META.")
historian = "historian:"
scanner = meta.getScanner([historian].to_java(java.lang.String))
while (result = scanner.next())
      meta.deleteAll(result.getRow())
end
exit 0
This flakey disable/enable/drop is frustrating users. Need to fix.
