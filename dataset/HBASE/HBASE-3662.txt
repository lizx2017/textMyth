Summary:
REST server does not respect client supplied max versions when creating scanner
Description:
In org.apache.hadoop.hbase.rest.ScannerResource.update(), where a new scanner is created on the server, we don't seem to respect the max versions value sent by the client:
    RowSpec spec = new RowSpec(model.getStartRow(), endRow,
      model.getColumns(), model.getStartTime(), model.getEndTime(), 1);
Looks to me like the last argument of "1" should instead be model.getMaxVersions().
