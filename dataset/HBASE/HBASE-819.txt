Summary:
Remove DOS-style ^M carriage returns from all code where found
Description:
There are a few files that contain DOS-style carriage returns. This is leading to issues when applying patches.
The presence of these may also be causing a snowball effect as some IDEs/editors may see one and attempt to apply that LF/CR format to all lines or files.
