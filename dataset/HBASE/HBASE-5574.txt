Summary:
DEFAULT_MAX_FILE_SIZE defaults to a negative value
Description:
HBASE-4365 changed the value of DEFAULT_MAX_FILE_SIZE from 256MB to 10G. Here is the line of code:
public static final long DEFAULT_MAX_FILE_SIZE = 10 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024;
The problem is that java evaluates the constant as an int which wraps and gets assigned to a long. I verified this with a test. The quick fix is to change the end to 1024L;
