Summary:
Fix improper master znode deserialization
Description:
In ActiveMasterManager#blockUntilBecomingActiveMaster the master znode is created as a versioned serialized version of ServerName
     if (ZKUtil.createEphemeralNodeAndWatch(this.watcher,
          this.watcher.masterAddressZNode, sn.getVersionedBytes())) {
There are a few user visible places where it is used but not deserialized properly.
