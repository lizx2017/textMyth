Summary:
Coprocessor classloader is replicated for all regions in the HRegionServer
Description:
HBASE-6308 introduced a new custom CoprocessorClassLoader to load the coprocessor classes and a new instance of this CL is created for each single HRegion opened. This leads to OOME-PermGen when the number of regions go above hundres / region server.
Having the table coprocessor jailed in a separate classloader is good however we should create only one for all regions of a table in each HRS.
