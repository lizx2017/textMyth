Summary:
getRowWithColumnsTs changed behavior
Description:
The method getRowWithTimestampTs of the thrift interface changed behavior from version 0.19 to 0.20:
In 0.19, it returned only cells with exactly the given timestamp, 0.20 it to returns cells with a timestamp before (not including) the given timestamp.
It needs to be clearified, which one is the desired behavior.
I attach a patch to make 0.20 conform with 0.19 (only return cells with exactly the given timestamp), if this is what is wanted.
