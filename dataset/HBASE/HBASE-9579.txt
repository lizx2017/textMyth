Summary:
Sanity check visiblity and audience for server-side modules.
Description:
Similar to HBASE-9495 we should audit the hbase-hadoop*-compat, hbase-prefix-tree, hbase-protocol and hbase server-modules.
I'll go through each module first making most things private, and then do a second pass using some sort of LimitedPrivate marking for apis that we'd expect coprocs or advanced tests to use.
This is less urgent that the work for the client facing apis.
