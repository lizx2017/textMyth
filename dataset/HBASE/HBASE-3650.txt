Summary:
HBA.delete can return too fast
Description:
One of our engineers got a weird TableExistsException in his code and I see that the client-side logging says the table was deleted in less than a second while it took the master 5 seconds to do it. Doing code inspection, the .META. scanner in HBA.delete can set found to true and then set it back to false in the case where the deleted table isn't the last one. We should just do a scan that would get the rows specific to the table instead of scanning all the rows.
