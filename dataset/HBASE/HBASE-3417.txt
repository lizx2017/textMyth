Summary:
CacheOnWrite is using the temporary output path for block names, need to use a more consistent block naming scheme
Description:
Currently the block names used in the block cache are built using the filesystem path. However, for cache on write, the path is a temporary output file.
The original COW patch actually made some modifications to block naming stuff to make it more consistent but did not do enough. Should add a separate method somewhere for generating block names using some more easily mocked scheme (rather than just raw path as we generate a random unique file name twice, once for tmp and then again when moved into place).
