Summary:
HBASE-1822 removed not-deprecated APIs
Description:
The scope of HBASE-1822 was to remove deprecated APIs but some methods removed weren't even deprecated in the first place. For example from Scan:
-
-  /**
-   * Parses a combined family and qualifier and adds either both or just the 
-   * family in case there is not qualifier. This assumes the older colon 
-   * divided notation, e.g. "data:contents" or "meta:".
-   * <p>
-   * Note: It will through an error when the colon is missing.
-   * 
-   * @param familyAndQualifier
-   * @return A reference to this instance.
-   * @throws IllegalArgumentException When the colon is missing.
-   */
-  public Scan addColumn(byte[] familyAndQualifier) {
-    byte [][] fq = KeyValue.parseColumn(familyAndQualifier);
-    if (fq.length > 1 && fq[1] != null && fq[1].length > 0) {
-      addColumn(fq[0], fq[1]);  
-    } else {
-      addFamily(fq[0]);
-    }
-    return this;
-  }
There's more than 1 method and the same applies for Get. Also o.a.h.h.io.Cell was cleaned but not removed.
