Summary:
Backport some region splitting fixes into 0.90.7
Description:
Issue tracking backport of some relatively small region splitting fixes into 0.90.7:
HBASE-4816: Regionserver wouldn't go down because split happened exactly at same time we issued bulk user region close call on our way out - fixed in 0.92
HBASE-4881: Unhealthy region is on service caused by rollback of region splitting - fixed in 0.92
HBASE-5189: Add metrics to keep track of region-splits in RS - fixed in 0.94
HBASE-6158: Data loss if the words 'merges' or 'splits' are used as Column Family name - fixed in 0.92 and 0.94
