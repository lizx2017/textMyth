Summary:
Nit-pick about hbase-2279 shell fixup, if you do get with non-existant column family, throws lots of exceptions
Description:
I believe the old shell would complain once only.. .or at least, it didn't print out so many fat exceptions. New fixedup shell will retry a bunch of times with a fat stack trace each time. Assigning Alexey 'cos he asked for it.
