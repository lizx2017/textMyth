Summary:
./hbase shell would not launch due to missing jruby dependency
Description:
./hbase shell - gave some error due to missing org/jruby/.. etc.
Add the following to ivy.xml -
<dependency org="org.jruby" name="jruby-complete"
rev="${jruby.version}" conf="common->default" />
Also - in HBASE-2114 - there is an issue about missing log4j configuration as well. ( due to the fact that build/ivy/lib/common did not contain log4j , but build/ivy/lib/test did ).
This patch addresses either of them.
