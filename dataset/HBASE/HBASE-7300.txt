Summary:
HbckTestingUtil needs to keep a static executor to lower the number of threads used
Description:
I can't run TestHBaseFsck on my machine without running out of threads, that's because each new HBaseFsck creates 50 threads. It has a constructor that takes an executor and HbckTestingUtil could keep a static one to pass in. I was able to cut thousands of threads with this.
