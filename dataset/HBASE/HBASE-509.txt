Summary:
Our hlog writing 'corrupts' hdfs
Description:
A couple of times during an upload, hdfs complains it is corrupt. Complaint is as following:
/hbase/XX.XX.XX-2.u.powerset.com/log_XX.XX.XX.92_1205384328364_60020/hlog.dat.025:  Replica placement policy is violated for blk_2712323855504360379. Block should be additionally replicated on 2 more rack(s).
/hbase/XX.XX.XX-2.u.powerset.com/log_XX.XX.XX.92_1205384328364_60020/hlog.dat.025: MISSING 1 blocks of total size 0 B.
Now the odd thing is that the next time I do a fsck, I see that log number its complaining about for the above server has increased inline with a new file just rolled as in:
......92_1205384328364_60020/hlog.dat.026:  Replica placement policy is violated for blk_4062204433046618058. Block should be additionally replicated on 2 more rack(s).
/hbase/aa0-005-2.u.powerset.com/log_XX.XX.XX.92_1205384328364_60020/hlog.dat.026: MISSING 1 blocks of total size 0 B.
Its no longer complaining about hlog.dat.025. If I do an fsck on the file hlog.dat.020, it says its healthy, replicated 7M file.
Likely an hdfs issue. Or its the way we're doing our logging? Restart reports cluster HEALTHY (didn't run fsck with remove 'bad' blocks or files).
