Summary:
If sidekick datanode goes down, regionserver is hosed
Description:
On the jgray cluster, datanodes died. Subsequently, could read from the table fine but attempts at writing into regions hosted by regionservers that sat beside dead datanodes fail â€“ connection refused.
This issue should be easy to replicate, just kill adjacent datanode.
