Summary:
Hlog recovery takes too much time
Description:
Currently HBase uses append to trigger the close of HLog during Hlog split. Append is a very expensive operation, which involves not only NameNode operations but creating a writing pipeline. If one of datanodes on the pipeline has a problem, this recovery may takes minutes. I'd like implement a lightweight NameNode operation to trigger lease recovery and make HBase to use this instead.
