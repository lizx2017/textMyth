Summary:
MetaServerShutdownHandler may potentially keep bumping up DeadServer.numProcessing
Description:
    } catch (IOException ioe) {
      this.services.getExecutorService().submit(this);
      this.deadServers.add(serverName);
      throw new IOException("failed log splitting for " +
          serverName + ", will retry", ioe);
    }
this.deadServers.add(serverName); will keep incrementing DeadServer.numProcessing
We can't get rid of numProcessing by just checking deadServers.size() because deadServers is also used to report some historically failed RSs.
