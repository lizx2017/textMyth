Summary:
offlining of table does not run reliably
Description:
I have a table of 4 regions made w/ PE. I cannot reliably offline it. I'm using 'disable TestTable' and have traced it to ensure its not a problem in hql. What I see is that one region will get the offlined mark or maybe two.. but never all.
Jim in IRC suggested that if we did the .TABLE. catalog table, offlining the entry there might be more reliable than trying to offline all regions in a table.
