Summary:
integration tests STILL won't run from tar.gz in trunk
Description:
The problem is that the class used to find test classes sits in common test jar, which is not included in the package.
However, if we move the class to the common jar itself, we'll have a JUnit dependency.
And if we cannot just move it to integration tests, because a test that verifies test categories makes use of it too.
This is all very sad.
I will see if there's any way to not have junit dependency (we already seem to deploy junit so it might not be such a big deal).
