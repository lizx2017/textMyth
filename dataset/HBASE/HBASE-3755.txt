Summary:
Catch zk's ConnectionLossException and augment error message with more help
Description:
0.90 has a different behavior regarding ZK connections, it tends to create too many of them and it's not obvious to users what they should do to fix. I think I've helped at least 5 different users this week with this error.
By catching ConnectionLossException and augmenting its message, we could say something like "it's possible that the ZooKeeper server has too many connections from this IP, see doc at blah" since the ZK server isn't nice enough to let us know what's going on.
