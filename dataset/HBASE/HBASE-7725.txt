Summary:
Add ability to create custom compaction request
Description:
You can request that a compaction be started, but you can't be sure when that compaction request completes. This is a simple update to the CompactionRequest interface and the compact-split thread on the RS that doesn't actually impact the RS exposed interface.
This is particularly useful for CPs so they can control starting/running a compaction.
Update - Better description (3/20/13):
Enable coprocessors to submit custom compaction requests.
This compaction request is used (if not null) through the entire compaction process. If no custom compaction request is submitted (its null - the normal case) then we we build a new compaction request via the usual mechanisms in the Store.
Adding this mechanism is particularly useful when 'special' compactions are desired and you want to do things like: only change certain files for a particularly requested compaction or follow a single compaction through the queue.
