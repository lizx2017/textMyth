Summary:
[hbase] Updated Implementation of RowFilterSet, RowFilterInterface
Description:
Unit tests on RowFilterSet revealed a problem with it's handling of nested state-maintaining filters. RowFilterSet returned as soon as possible for its implementations of filter and filterNotNull. This came at the cost of it not always calling every one of it's filters. Skipping these filters was problematic, particularly when a filter changes it's state when called to filter. As a result, later calls to filterAllRemaining() were non-deterministic (with an unordered set) or dependent on set ordering at best.
With much input from Michael Stack and James Kennedy, the problem has been resolved as follows: the RowFilterInterface has been updated to contain a boolean processAlways() method that states whether or not this filter MUST be called in any call to the filter hierarchy. Filters that require their state to be updated immediately upon every filter call (via a call to their filter methods), such as WhileMatchRowFilter (see HADOOP-1579), will return true for processAlways(). RowFilterSet will ensure that these filters always have their filtering methods called, whether or not they affect the final decision.
The patch proposed by this issue will make the necessary changes to RowFilterSet and RowFilterInterface, in addition to adding the tests for RowFilterSet.
