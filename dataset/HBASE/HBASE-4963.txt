Summary:
[89-fb] Per-table getsize metrics are broken
Description:
We need to make sure we get per-(table, CF) get size metrics in 0.89-fb, similarly to what was done in https://reviews.facebook.net/D483 for the trunk. Currently we only get metrics such as
hadoop.regionserver_cf.<cf>.getsize
even with per-table metrics turned on.
