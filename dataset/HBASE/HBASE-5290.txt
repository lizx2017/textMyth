Summary:
[FindBugs] Synchronization on boxed primitive
Description:
This bug is reported by the findBugs tool, which is a static analysis tool.
Bug: Synchronization on Integer in org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.compactions.CompactSelection.emptyFileList()
The code synchronizes on a boxed primitive constant, such as an Integer.
private static Integer count = 0;
...
  synchronized(count) {
     count++;
     }
...
Since Integer objects can be cached and shared, this code could be synchronizing on the same object as other, unrelated code, leading to unresponsiveness and possible deadlock
See CERT CON08-J. Do not synchronize on objects that may be reused for more information.
