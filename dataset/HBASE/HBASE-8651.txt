Summary:
Result of integer multiplication cast to long in HRegionFileSystem#sleepBeforeRetry()
Description:
    Threads.sleep(baseSleepBeforeRetries * sleepMultiplier);
Both baseSleepBeforeRetries and sleepMultiplier are integers. Without proper casting, their product may be negative.
Here is an example:
  static int i = Integer.MAX_VALUE-1;
  static long j = i * 2;
value of j above is -4 while 4294967292 was the expected value.
