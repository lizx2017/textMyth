Summary:
'ant clean' should not remove build directory.
Description:
It would be better if 'ant clean' does not remove build directory. Many projects do not remove this dir. One advantage of not removing is that, I can symlink the build to another place (e.g. /mnt/scratch/) and keep the source code in more reliable place. I will submit a patch if this sounds ok.
