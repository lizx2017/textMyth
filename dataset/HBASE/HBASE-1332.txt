Summary:
regionserver carrying .META. starts sucking all cpu, drives load up - infinite loop?
Description:
the symptom is the cluster comes to a dead halt. Lookups on meta don't seem to work, and the regionserver carrying .META. goes hot - using 800% CPU or more, driving system LA up really really high (I've seen it as high as 26). Thread dumps seem to indicate every IPC handler is stuck in Bytes.binarySearch().
