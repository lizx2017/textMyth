Summary:
check to see if we exceeded hbase.regionserver.maxlogs limit is incorrect
Description:
In HLog.java:cleanOldLogs(), the number of logs left after archiving of old logs is computed as:
    int logCount = this.outputfiles.size() - logsToRemove;
However, the archival itself already removes the files that were archived from the "this.outputfiles" map.
So shouldn't the above logic simply be the following?
  int logCount = this.outputfiles.size();
