Summary:
A region's state is kept in several places in the master opening the possibility for race conditions
Description:
A region's state exists in multiple maps in the RegionManager: unassignedRegions, pendingRegions, regionsToClose, closingRegions, regionsToDelete, etc.
One of these race conditions was found in HBASE-534.
For HBase-0.1.x, we should just patch the holes we find.
The ultimate solution (which requires a lot of changes in HMaster) should be applied to HBase trunk.
Proposed solution:
Create a class that encapsulates a region's state and provide synchronized access to the class that validates state changes.
There should be a single structure that holds regions in these transitional states and it should be a synchronized collection of some kind.
