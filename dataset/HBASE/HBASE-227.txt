Summary:
[hbase] Add tools for going from hregion name on disk to region name in logs
Description:
HADOOP-2056 encoded region names so they could be used safely as names of directories on the filesystem. Needs to be a means of going from actual region name to its encoded on-disk representation; currently its missing. At a minimum, have logs list both the region name and its hashed representation when iterating .META. table content: i.e. add hash representation to HRegionInfo.
