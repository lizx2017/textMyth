Summary:
TestSplitLogManager.testUnassignedTimeout is flaky
Description:
This is the most frequently failing test in the recent 0.94 jenkins builds.
Looking at the code it seem the timeouts are a bit too aggressive (there's only a 500ms window for the test to detect that a ZK was removed). I think we should just double the timeouts.
