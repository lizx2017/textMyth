Summary:
HBase RPC should allow protocol extension with common interfaces.
Description:
HBase RPC fails if MyProtocol extends an interface, which is not a VersionedProtocol even if MyProtocol also directly extends VersionedProtocol. The reason is that rpc Invocation uses Method.getDeclaringClass(), which returns the interface class rather than the class of MyProtocol.
