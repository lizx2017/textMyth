Summary:
Cluster Wide Pauses
Description:
Under heavy write load the entire cluster seems to pause with all nodes pausing writes/reads for several seconds at a time. This seems to be worse with larger region sizes. One possible explanation is that a single node gets caught/paused/stuck during a split and that all other nodes are waiting on that one node so it looks like a cluster wide pause.
