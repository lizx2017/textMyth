Summary:
hbck -fix clearInMaster is commented out
Description:
In 0.90 rc the actual guts of the clearInMaster function are commented out, but it logs that it's doing something. We should either make the function do something, or log something like: "hbck currently unable to fix region stuck in transition", rather than indicate we're doing something when in fact it's a noop.
