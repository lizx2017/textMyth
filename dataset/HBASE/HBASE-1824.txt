Summary:
[stargate] default timestamp should be LATEST_TIMESTAMP
Description:
From Greg Cottman up on hbase-user@
f I don't put the optional "timestamp" attribute in a Cell when I'm inserting data, the timestamp ends up as zero, which caused much confusion because it pre-dates the value I thought I was replacing. I assumed that not specifying this attribute would cause the timestamp to default to the current HBase server time. Instead I found I had to specify the timestamp as "-1" to get this behaviour. Is this a bug or an intentional semantic?
