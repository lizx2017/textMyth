Description:
See the following logs first:
2013-01-23 18:58:38,801 INFO org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.Store: Flushed , sequenceid=9746535080, memsize=101.8m, into tmp file hdfs://dw77.kgb.sqa.cm4:9900/hbase-test3/writetest1/8dc14e35b4d7c0e481e0bb30849cff7d/.tmp/bebeeecc56364b6c8126cf1dc6782a25

2013-01-23 18:58:41,982 WARN org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.MemStore: Snapshot called again without clearing previous. Doing nothing. Another ongoing flush or did we fail last attempt?


2013-01-23 18:58:43,274 INFO org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.Store: Flushed , sequenceid=9746599334, memsize=101.8m, into tmp file hdfs://dw77.kgb.sqa.cm4:9900/hbase-test3/writetest1/8dc14e35b4d7c0e481e0bb30849cff7d/.tmp/4eede32dc469480bb3d469aaff332313
The first time memstore flush is failed when commitFile()(Logged the first edit above), then trigger server abort, but another flush is coming immediately(could caused by move/split,Logged the third edit above) and successful.
For the same memstore's snapshot, we get different sequenceid, it causes data loss when replaying log edits
