Summary:
[hbase] Parameters for TestDFSAbort too aggressive
Description:
The parameter settings for client retries both at the Hadoop IPC level and at the HBase client level seem to aggressive. Even though lucene.zones.apache.org is a quad CPU machine, it routinely displays a load average of ~8. It runs much slower than any of our test machines: Core 2 duo MacBook Pro (running Linux or MacOs), Dual dual-core opterons (Linux), Core 2 (Windows) and even a PentiumM (Windows).
Consequently, tests that run just fine in the environments listed above sometimes fail on lucene.zones.
It is unclear if this is due to thread scheduling differences between Solaris and Linux/Windows or in the respective JVM's.
To make some tests run reliably in the Hudson build environment, we sometimes have to increase retries and timeouts, which we set aggressively so that the tests will run faster.
If that is what it takes to prevent Hudson build failures, then so be it. The tests may take longer to run, but if that is the tradeoff to achieve reliability, then so be it.
