Summary:
ZKConfig defaults clientPort improperly
Description:
ZKConfig#makeZKProps() should use "clientPort" as the client port key in its output when defaulting instead of "hbase.zookeeper.property.clientPort". This method strips the "hbase.zookeeper.property." prefix from all of the properties it returns, so the client port key should not have it. The result is that the default is not properly picked up.
