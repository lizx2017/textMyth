Summary:
[hbase] backport fix for sporadic testtables failure (hadoop-1616) to hadoop 0.14 branch
Description:
HADOOP-1616 did not make it into 0.14 branch. Should help make hbase unit tests run more reliably.
Will backport as soon as I can make the branch tests all pass. Currently fails on TestSymLink (doesn't seem to be same as hadoop-1596):
Testcase: testSymLink took 5.512 sec
