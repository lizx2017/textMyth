Summary:
hbase table filename problem
Description:
running ver 0.15.0
I store web pages in hbase and use the urls as row keys like google does with bigtable but it seams that with foward slashes ( / ) as the row key breaks the path for the hbase filenames example
starting off one of my tables has this file name
hregion_webdata,,-3862545529986602998
but when it trys to split it will have these file names
hregion_webdata,,-3862545529986602998
hregion_webdata,com.tripod.beifaust/robots.txt:http,837745221057372860
The / in the row key from the url is breaking the path name to the hregion file. This causes the region server to exit. I assume it would kill all region servers in a pool by assigning each one the table and each would die on trying the split the table.
Easy solution for this would be the key/filename need to be escaped but I am not sure how thats done in java.
