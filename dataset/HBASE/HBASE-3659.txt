Summary:
TestHLog fails on newer Hadoop
Description:
There are some subtle changes in IPC in the newer Hadoop trees that cause TestHLog to fail. The issue is that when it restarts the minicluster, the new DNs pick up a cached IPC connection to the old NN, which has closed its end of the IPC pipe. This causes the new DNs to fail to start and the test fails. Adding a strategic sleep fixes it.
