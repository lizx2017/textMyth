Summary:
RegionHistorian.getRegionHistory was changed to take String instead of byte[]
Description:
There are 2 ways of transporting byte[] as strings:
Bytes.toString()/toBytes() - utf-8 encode
Bytes.toStringBinary()/toBytesBinary() - hex escaping for bytes that arent A-Za-z0-9_-,.
By changing this function to String and calling Bytes.toString() it prevents the caller from making the transport decision. Specifically my fixes for binary keys in the JSP rely on the JSP doing the Bytes.toStringBinary instead of Bytes.toString().
