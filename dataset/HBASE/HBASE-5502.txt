Summary:
region_mover.rb fails to load regions back to original server for regions only containing empty tables.
Description:
The region_mover loadRegion function incorrectly uses 'isSuccessfulScan':
 
  for r in regions
    exists = false
    begin
      exists = isSuccessfulScan(admin, r)
    rescue org.apache.hadoop.hbase.NotServingRegionException => e
      $LOG.info("Failed scan of " + e.message)
    end
isSuccessfulScan throws an exception when it fails rather than returning status.
As a result empty regions don't get restored - this is the case in a fresh install (which is how I discovered this) with no user table.
Modifying the code to set exists IF isSuccessfulScan does not throw an exception worked for me:
  for r in regions
    exists = false
    begin
      isSuccessfulScan(admin, r)
      exists = true
    rescue org.apache.hadoop.hbase.NotServingRegionException => e
      $LOG.info("Failed scan of " + e.message)
    end
