Summary:
Trunk/0.95 cannot simply compile against Hadoop 1.0
Description:
Currently we can't simply compile against Hadoop 1.0 in 0.95 and newer, we are missing a dependency in common for Apache's commons-io. Easy fix, we could just add that dependency for all the profiles there. But doing it correctly requires adding a new profile.
