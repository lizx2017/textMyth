Summary:
Maven HBase build broken on cygwin with copynativelib.sh call.
Description:
This is broken in both 0.92 as well as trunk pom.xml
Here's a sample maven log snippet from trunk (from Mayuresh on user mailing list)
[INFO] [antrun:run
{execution: package}
]
[INFO] Executing tasks
main:
[mkdir] Created dir: D:\workspace\mkshirsa\hbase-trunk\target\hbase-0.93-SNAPSHOT\hbase-0.93-SNAPSHOT\lib\native\${build.platform}
[exec] ls: cannot access D:workspacemkshirsahbase-trunktarget/nativelib: No such file or directory
[exec] tar (child): Cannot connect to D: resolve failed
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[ERROR] BUILD ERROR
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] An Ant BuildException has occured: exec returned: 3328
There are two issues:
1) The ant run task below doesn't resolve the windows file separator returned by the project.build.directory - this causes the above resolve failed.
<!-- Using Unix cp to preserve symlinks, using script to handle wildcards -->
<echo file="${project.build.directory}/copynativelibs.sh">
if [ `ls ${project.build.directory}/nativelib | wc -l` -ne 0]; then
2) The tar argument value below also has a similar issue in that the path arg doesn't resolve right.
<!-- Using Unix tar to preserve symlinks -->
<exec executable="tar" failonerror="yes" dir="${project.build.directory}/${project.artifactId}-${project.version}">
<arg value="czf"/>
<arg value="/cygdrive/c/workspaces/hbase-0.92-svn/target/${project.artifactId}-${project.version}.tar.gz"/>
<arg value="."/>
</exec>
In both cases, the fix would probably be to use a cross-platform way to handle the directory locations.
