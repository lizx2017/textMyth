Summary:
HMaster.getProtocolVersion() ignores HMasterRegionInterface.VERSION
Description:
The recent split of RPC protocol version numbers doesn't work quite as expected with HMasterRegionInterface. Since HMaster implements both HMasterInterface and HMasterRegionInterface, its getProtocolVersion() implementation needs to check the requested protocol name and return either the HMasterInterface.VERSION value or HMasterRegionInterface.VERSION value as appropriate.
