Summary:
No need to retry scan operation on the same server in case of RegionServerStoppedException
Description:
ScannerCallable.java doesn't retry on the same server in case of NotServingRegionException.
if (ioe instanceof NotServingRegionException) {
// Throw a DNRE so that we break out of cycle of calling NSRE
// when what we need is to open scanner against new location.
// Attach NSRE to signal client that it needs to resetup scanner.
throw new DoNotRetryIOException("Reset scanner", ioe);
In the scenario when region server is in shutdown process, RegionServerStoppedException will be thrown. ScannerCallable still retry. It isn't necessary.
