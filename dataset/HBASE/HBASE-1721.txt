Summary:
IOException: Cannot append; log is closed
Description:
JGray RS was stuck doing the below:
IOException: Cannot append; log is closed
Just kept going on and on.
Was after a zk session timeout. Regionserver had restarted itself and had been taking on new regions just fine. I saw this entry from HLog:
2009-07-29 08:13:13,493 INFO org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.HLog: HLog configuration: blocksize=67108864, rollsize=63753420, enabled=true, flushlogentries=100, optionallogflushinternal=10000ms
2009-07-29 08:13:13,495 INFO org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.HLog: New hlog /hbase/.logs/hb2,60020,1248880393481/hlog.dat.1248880393493
Then two minutes later I saw the 'Cannot append'.
I do not see any close nor on a cursory glance, how this situation might arise â€“ somethign to do with the restart?
