Summary:
HBASE-8469 added a hdfs-site.xml file for tests but it gets included in the test jar
Description:
Aleksandr Shulman found in his tests that HBase recently started ignoring hdfs-site.xml when it's on the classpath. I found that HBASE-8469 added an hdfs-site.xml for the unit tests but it's not excluded when building the jar.
