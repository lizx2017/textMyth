Summary:
ZK based Read/Write locks for table operations
Description:
This has started as forward porting of HBASE-5494 and HBASE-5991 from the 89-fb branch to trunk, but diverged enough to have it's own issue.
The idea is to implement a zk based read/write lock per table. Master initiated operations should get the write lock, and region operations (region split, moving, balance?, etc) acquire a shared read lock.
