Summary:
We can get an order to open a region while shutting down and it'll hold up regionserver shutdown
Description:
Starting and stopping clusters I see that an open directive can come in while we are shutting down all the user space regions on a particular regionserver. Regionservers will only shut themselves down after all user space regions have closed. We queue up all the closes at a particular time. If an open comes in while we are in the closing condition, then the regionserver won't go down. The region open needs to be blocked.
