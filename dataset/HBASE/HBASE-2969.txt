Summary:
missing sync in HTablePool.getTable()
Description:
Considering that the method getTable(String) in org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.HTablePool is invoked by multiple threads, it may happen that while 'queue == null' is true, it is possible to have a queue mapped to that name into the tables map when 'tables.put(tableName, queue)' is executed.
However, I don't think it will cause any harm because the overwritten queue will eventually be garbage-collected.
