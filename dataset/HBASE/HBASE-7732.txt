Summary:
[89-fb] Make HFileWriter use the bytesPerChecksum obtained from config
Description:
we found a bug in the latest HBase code which "hfile.io.bytes.per.checksum" does not take effect. Because we have never call HFile.getBytesPerChecksum() when creating a HFile.
Fix this issue by calling the correct bytes/checksum (from HFile.getBytesPerChecksum) for HFile creating ?
