Problems with getFull
Description:
There are some issues with the implementation of getFull in HStore.
If the loop encounters a deleted cell, it stops iterating. This correctly handles deletes, but then accidentally masks away any cells of different qualifiers that would come afterward
Since the mapfiles are search oldest to newest, and the results map is only updated when there isn't already a value in the results map for for the cell we're currently looking at, older values actually take precedence over newer ones. This may be fixed by simply reversing the order of mapfiles traversed to newest to oldest.
