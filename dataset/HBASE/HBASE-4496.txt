Summary:
HFile V2 does not honor setCacheBlocks when scanning.
Description:
While testing the LRU cache during the scanning I noticed quite some churn in the cache even when Scan.cacheBlocks is set to false. After debugging this, I found that HFile V2 always caches blocks in the LRU cache regardless of the cacheBlocks setting.
Here's a trace (from Eclipse) showing the problem:
HFileReaderV2.readBlock(long, int, boolean, boolean, boolean) line: 279
HFileReaderV2.readBlockData(long, long, int, boolean) line: 219
HFileBlockIndex$BlockIndexReader.seekToDataBlock(byte[], int, int, HFileBlock) line: 191
HFileReaderV2$ScannerV2.seekTo(byte[], int, int, boolean) line: 502
HFileReaderV2$ScannerV2.reseekTo(byte[], int, int) line: 539
StoreFileScanner.reseekAtOrAfter(HFileScanner, KeyValue) line: 151
StoreFileScanner.reseek(KeyValue) line: 110
KeyValueHeap.reseek(KeyValue) line: 255
StoreScanner.reseek(KeyValue) line: 409
StoreScanner.next(List<KeyValue>, int) line: 304
KeyValueHeap.next(List<KeyValue>, int) line: 114
KeyValueHeap.next(List<KeyValue>) line: 143
HRegion$RegionScannerImpl.nextRow(byte[]) line: 2774
HRegion$RegionScannerImpl.nextInternal(int) line: 2722
HRegion$RegionScannerImpl.next(List<KeyValue>, int) line: 2682
HRegion$RegionScannerImpl.next(List<KeyValue>) line: 2699
HRegionServer.next(long, int) line: 2092
Every scanner.next causes a reseek, which eventually causes a call to HFileBlockIndex$BlockIndexReader.seekToDataBlock(...) at which point the cacheBlocks information is lost. HFileReaderV2.readBlockData calls HFileReaderV2.readBlock with cacheBlocks set unconditionally to true.
The fix is not immediately clear, unless we want to pass cacheBlocks to HFileBlockIndex$BlockIndexReader.seekToDataBlock and then on to HFileBlock.BasicReader.readBlockData and all its implementers, which is ugly as readBlockData should not care about caching.
Avoiding caching during scans is somewhat important for us.
