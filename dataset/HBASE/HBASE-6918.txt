Summary:
Debugging to help figure what is different up on jenkins when TestHeapSize runs
Description:
TestHeapSize will pass locally then fail up on jenkins. Add debugging to the test that prints detail on environment and jvm in particular to can figure what is different between two environments (it used to be that the d32 flag was needed to mimic jenkins but now we are jdk7, the d32 flag doesn't work w/ my oracle jvm... let me see what jenkins has).
