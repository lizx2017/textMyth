Summary:
A successful write to client write-buffer may be lost or not visible
Description:
A client can do a write to a client side 'write buffer' if enabled via hTable.setAutoFlush(false). Now, assume a client puts value v under key k. Two wrongs things can happen, violating the ACID semantics of Hbase given at: http://hbase.apache.org/acid-semantics.html
1) Say the client fails immediately after the put succeeds. In this case, the put will be lost, violating the durability property:
<quote> Any operation that returns a "success" code (eg does not throw an exception) will be made durable. </quote>
2) Say the client issues a read for k immediately after writing k. The put will be stored in the client side write buffer, while the read will go to the region server, returning an older value, instead of v, violating the visibility property:
<quote>
When a client receives a "success" response for any mutation, that mutation
is immediately visible to both that client and any client with whom it later
communicates through side channels.
