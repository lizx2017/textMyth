Summary:
Replacing thread notification-based queue with java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue in HMaster
Description:
In HMaster, there is a msgQueue typed as an ArrayList<PendingOperations>. PendingOperations are added to the queue and notify() is called on msgQueue. I think using a BlockingQueue<PendingOperations> makes the intent of the code more clear and removes potentially problematic synchronization issues. BlockingQueues are thread-safe and allow multiple producers and consumers. I have written a patch for this and will attach it.
