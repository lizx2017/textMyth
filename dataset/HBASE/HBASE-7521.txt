Summary:
fix HBASE-6060 (regions stuck in opening state) in 0.94
Description:
Discussion in HBASE-6060 implies that the fix there does not work on 0.94. Still, we may want to fix the issue in 0.94 (via some different fix) because the regions stuck in opening for ridiculous amounts of time is not a good thing to have.
