Summary:
checkAndPut implementation doesnt verify row param and writable row are the same
Description:
the API checkAndPut, and on the server side checkAndMutate doesn't enforce that the row in the API call and the row in the passed writable that should be executed if the check passes, are the same row! Looking at the code, if someone were to 'fool' us, we'd probably end up with rows in the wrong region in the worst case. Or we'd end up with non-locked puts/deletes to different rows since the checkAndMutate grabs the row lock and calls put/delete methods that do not grab row locks.
