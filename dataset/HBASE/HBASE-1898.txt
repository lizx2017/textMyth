Summary:
Each Store replays WAL split. Should be replayed at Region level (it used to be done here)
Description:
Looking at Store constructor, each Store in a Region picks up the split output log and replays it in turn. Seems like we should be reading the file of edits once up at the Region level and per edit figuring which store to insert into?
