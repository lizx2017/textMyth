Summary:
Metrics for scan object are overwritten when restart() is called
Description:
From HBASE-4145:
There's an issue in TableRecordReaderImpl. Calling restart() does this:
public void restart(byte[] firstRow) throws IOException {
  currentScan = new Scan(scan);
Which by itself is fine since the metrics will be copied from scan to currentScan, except that it's currentScan that has the updated metrics not scan.
In other words, currentScan is the object that is used for scanning so it contains the metrics. If restart() is called, that object is overwritten by the original definition of the Scan. I think to fix this we could grab the metrics from currentScan first then set them back on the new object.
