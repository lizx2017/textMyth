Summary:
MR example job to count table rows
Description:
The Lars' import is a little messy; he's not sure how many records were imported. Running a select takes a couple of hours. He happens to have an idle MR cluster standing by. An example MR job that just did a count of records would be generally useful. Could even output row keys so you'd have a list of what made it in. Later, if this tool becomes popular with derivatives and similiars, we can bundle a jar of MR jobs to run against your tables that can answer common queries and that are amenable to subclassing/modification.
