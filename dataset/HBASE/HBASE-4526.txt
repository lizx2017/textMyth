Summary:
special case for stopping master in hbase-daemon.sh is no longer required
Description:
Now that HBASE-4209 is finally done (many thanks to stack for help and encouragement!) I don't think there's any reason to keep this bit of code in hbase-daemon.sh:
        if [ "$command" = "master" ]; then
          echo "`date` Killing $command" >> $loglog
          kill -9 `cat $pid` > /dev/null 2>&1
        else
          echo "`date` Killing $command" >> $loglog
          kill `cat $pid` > /dev/null 2>&1
        fi
I suggest we remove the special case completely, since I don't think it serves any useful purpose (patch attached).
Now, as an additional precautionary measure. We can try to follow up with a SIGKILL once a certain timeout expires.
Let me know if you think it is necessary to do so and I'll update the patch.
