Summary:
getsize per-CF metric incorrectly counts compaction related reads as well
Description:
The per-CF "getsize" metric's intent was to track bytes returned (to HBase clients) per-CF. Note: We already have metrics to track # of HFileBlock's read for compaction vs. non-compaction cases -- e.g., compactionblockreadcnt vs. fsblockreadcnt.
Currently, the "getsize" metric gets updated for both client initiated Get/Scan operations as well for compaction related reads. The metric is updated in StoreScanner.java:next() when the Scan query matcher returns an INCLUDE* code via a:
HRegion.incrNumericMetric(this.metricNameGetsize, copyKv.getLength());
We should not do the above in case of compactions.
