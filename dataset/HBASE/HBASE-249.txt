Summary:
[hbase] address regression
Description:
HADOOP-2274 introduced race conditions that cause a regression which was the reason for Hadoop-Nightly build #314's failure.
Symptoms of this regression are:
Assigning a single region to multiple region servers.
Thread starvation resulting in server lease expiration when, in fact, the region server had reported in but the main processing thread in the master did not renew the server's lease soon enough.
