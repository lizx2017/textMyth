Summary:
Fix KeyOnlyFilter + Add Value Length
Description:
HBASE-3211 altered filter code to mutate KeyValues. What could go wrong? Well, your scan could mess up because the KVHeap compare functions don't work properly. If we're going to soft mutate KVs in filter code, we also need to soft copy the KV before filtering. This was found while adding the ability to have KeyOnlyFilter have the option to return the Value's length. This is useful for grouping your reduce tasks into equal-sized blocks.
