Summary:
rolling-restart.sh script hangs when attempting to detect expiration of /hbase/master znode.
Description:
Due to bugfix ZOOKEEPER-1059 (ZK 3.4.0+), the rolling-restart.sh script will hang when attempting to make sure the /hbase/master znode is deleted.
Here's the code
# make sure the master znode has been deleted before continuing
    zparent=`$bin/hbase org.apache.hadoop.hbase.util.HBaseConfTool zookeeper.znode.parent`
    if [ "$zparent" == "null" ]; then zparent="/hbase"; fi
    zmaster=`$bin/hbase org.apache.hadoop.hbase.util.HBaseConfTool zookeeper.znode.master`
    if [ "$zmaster" == "null" ]; then zmaster="master"; fi
    zmaster=$zparent/$zmaster
    echo -n "Waiting for Master ZNode ${zmaster} to expire"
    while bin/hbase zkcli stat $zmaster >/dev/null 2>&1; do
      echo -n "."
      sleep 1
    done
    echo #force a newline
Prior to ZOOKEEPER-1059, stat on a null znode would NPE and cause zkcli to exit with retcode 1. Afterwards, the null is caught, zkcli will exit with 0 in the case where the znode is present and in the case where it does not exist.
