Summary:
hbck merges .META. regions if there's an old leftover
Description:
Trying to see what caused HBASE-6310, one of the things I figured is that the bad .META. row is actually one from the time that we were permitting meta splitting and that folder had just been staying there for a while.
So I tried to recreate the issue with -repair and it merged my good .META. region with the one that's 3 years old that also has the same start key. I ended up with a brand new .META. region!
I'll be attaching the full log in a separate file.
