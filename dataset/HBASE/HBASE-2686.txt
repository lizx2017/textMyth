Summary:
LogRollListener is not a Listener, rename
Description:
J-D just pointed out the fact that LogRollListener Interface cannot listen. It has a single method named logRollRequested. Lets fix. Rename the interface LogRoll (and the method name while we're at it... its past tense but returns a void?)
Lets fix this stuff. It makes the code base hard to grok.
