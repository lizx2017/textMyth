Summary:
Deadlock between HRegion.ICV and HRegion.close
Description:
HRegion.ICV gets a row lock then gets a newScanner lock.
HRegion.close gets a newScanner lock, slitCloseLock and finally waits for all row locks to finish.
If the ICV got the row lock and then close got the newScannerLock, both end up waiting on the other. This was introduced when Get became a Scan.
Stack thinks we can get rid of the newScannerLock in close since we setClosing to true.
