Summary:
Ensure that we flush/close Regions before the RS stops answering client requests.
Description:
Currently, the RS stops responding as soon as the stop is requested. We then go in and close all regions in a 2-flush mechanism.
Ensure that RS will first close the regions, and then stop taking client requests. This will reduce the number of errors seen by the client.
