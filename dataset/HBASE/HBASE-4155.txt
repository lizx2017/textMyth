Summary:
the problem in hbase thrift client when scan/get rows by timestamp
Description:
I want to scan rows by specified timestamp. I use following hbase shell command :
scan 'testcrawl',
{TIMESTAMP=>1312268202071}

ROW COLUMN+CELL
put1.com column=crawl:data, timestamp=1312268202071, value=<html>put1</html>
put1.com column=crawl:type, timestamp=1312268202071, value=html
put1.com column=links:outlinks, timestamp=1312268202071, value=www.163.com;www.sina.com
As I expected, I can get the rows which timestamp is 1312268202071.
But when I use thift client to do the same thing ,the return data is the rows which time before specified timestamp , not the same as hbase shell.following is timestamp of return data:
1312179170000
1312268202059
I look up the source in hbase/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/thrift/ThriftServer.java, it use following code to set time parameter .
scan.setTimeRange(Long.MIN_VALUE, timestamp);
This cause thrift client return rows before specified row ,not the rows timestamp specified.
But in hbase client and avro client ï¼Œit use following code to set time parameter.
scan.setTimeStamp(timestamp);
this will return rows timestamp specified.
Is this a feature or a bug in thrift client ?
if this is a feature, which method in thrift client can get the rows by specified timestamp?
