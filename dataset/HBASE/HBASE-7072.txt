Summary:
HBase-5256 breaks 0.92-0.94 compatibility
Description:
HBase-5286 changes RegionLoad writable in 94.0, making it incompatible with 92. A fix was made in HBase-5795 where a 94 client can read response from a 92 server, but not vice versa. Currently, if a 92 client tries to do read RegionLoad (HBase shell "status" command, or, 92 master and 94 regionserver), it just hangs.
