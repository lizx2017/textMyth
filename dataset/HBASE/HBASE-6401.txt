Summary:
HBase may lose edits after a crash if used with HDFS 1.0.3 or older
Description:
This comes from a hdfs bug, fixed in some hdfs versions. I haven't found the hdfs jira for this.
Context: HBase Write Ahead Log features. This is using hdfs append. If the node crashes, the file that was written is read by other processes to replay the action.
So we have in hdfs one (dead) process writing with another process reading.
But, despite the call to syncFs, we don't always see the data when we have a dead node. It seems to be because the call in DFSClient#updateBlockInfo ignores the ipc errors and set the length to 0.
So we may miss all the writes to the last block if we try to connect to the dead DN.
hdfs 1.0.3, branch-1 or branch-1-win: we have the issue
http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/hadoop/common/branches/branch-1/src/hdfs/org/apache/hadoop/hdfs/DFSClient.java?revision=1359853&view=markup
hdfs branch-2 or trunk: we should not have the issue (but not tested)
http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/hadoop/common/branches/branch-2/hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/hdfs/DFSInputStream.java?view=markup
The attached test will fail ~50 of the time.
