Summary:
documentation/javadoc error in SingleColumnValueFilter constructor
Description:
The behaviour when the column is not found is documented differently in the constructor and in the setter. The constructor is actually wrong: by default, when the column is not found, the row is emitted (may be the opposite would be better, but it's another question)
SingleColumnValueFilter
public SingleColumnValueFilter(byte[] family,
byte[] qualifier,
CompareFilter.CompareOp compareOp,
byte[] value)
Constructor for binary compare of the value of a single column. If the column is found and the condition passes, all columns of the row will be emitted. If the column is not found or the condition fails, the row will not be emitted.
setFilterIfMissing
public void setFilterIfMissing(boolean filterIfMissing)
Set whether entire row should be filtered if column is not found.
If true, the entire row will be skipped if the column is not found.
If false, the row will pass if the column is not found. This is default.
Possible correction for the constructor documentation:
If the column is found and the condition passes, all columns of the row will be emitted. If the condition fails, the row will not be emitted. The behavior when the column is not found is defined by setFilterIfMissing.
