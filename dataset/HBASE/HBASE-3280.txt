Summary:
YouAreDeadException being swallowed in HRS getMaster()
Description:
In the HRS, when we lose our connection to the master, we enter into a loop where we keep trying to get the new master location in ZK and attempt to send our heartbeat. Within tryRegionServerReport() we could get a YouAreDeadException, but we won't let it out. This leads to the RS continuously heartbeating in to the master although the master keeps telling it to kill itself.
