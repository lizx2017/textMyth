Summary:
HBaseClusterManager shell code breaks hadoop-2.0 build
Description:
I get the following error:
HBaseClusterManager.java:[73,23] getExecString() in org.apache.hadoop.hbase.HBaseClusterManager.RemoteShell cannot override getExecString() in org.apache.hadoop.util.Shell.ShellCommandExecutor; attempting to assign weaker access privileges; was public
the issue is that getExecString() is declared public in hadoop-2.0, but protected in hadoop-1.0. In HBase, it is declared protected, and you can't downgrade from public to protected.
We can just declare the function public and that seems to work, but given that in hadoop the class is declared
@InterfaceAudience.LimitedPrivate({"HDFS", "MapReduce"})
perhaps we should just copy the class into hbase source.
