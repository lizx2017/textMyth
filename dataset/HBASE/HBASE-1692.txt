Summary:
Web UI is extremely slow / freezes up if you have many tables
Description:
I have 40 tables and every time the web ui loads (or i refresh it) the browser locks up and it takes 5-10 seconds to render the page.
In a dev cluster I had 3 tables and it was fast.
I thought there was a jira for this already but I couldn't find it... please correct me if there is.
