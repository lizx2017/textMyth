Summary:
Scanner threads are interrupted without acquiring lock properly
Description:
There are a few places where scanner threads are interrupted with .interrupt() instead of .interruptIfAlive(). This means that if they're in the midst of the checkFileSystem operation, it'll end up catching the interruption there, determine that the filesystem is down, and shut down the whole server. Other nasties can also result.
