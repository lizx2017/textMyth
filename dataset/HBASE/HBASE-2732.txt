Summary:
TestZooKeeper was broken, HBASE-2691 showed it
Description:
Since I committed HBASE-2691, TestZooKeeper began failing. Looking at it, it's because it's setup with only 1 region server and we kill it... and it's not restarting. IIRC we were relying on that feature before but looks like we're not anymore.
