Summary:
Backup master not starting up due to Bind Exception while starting HttpServer
Description:
Backup master tries to bind to the info port 60010.
This is done once the back up master becomes active. Even before that the Data Xceviers threads (IPC handlers) are started and they are started at random port. If already 60010 is used then when standby master comes up then it fails due to bind exception.
