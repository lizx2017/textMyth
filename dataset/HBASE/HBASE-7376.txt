Summary:
Acquiring readLock does not apply timeout in HRegion#flushcache
Description:
HRegion
  public boolean flushcache() throws IOException {
       lock(lock.readLock());
  }
The HRegion.flushcache is called by the normal flush cache, so if we use a timeout, the MemStoreFlusher may be get a RegionTooBusyException, it is safe to do not use a timeout.
