Summary:
Integrate RWCC with Append and Increment operations
Description:
Currently Increment and Append operations do not work with RWCC and hence a client could see the results of multiple such operation mixed in the same Get/Scan.
The semantics might be a bit more interesting here as upsert adds and removes to and from the memstore.
