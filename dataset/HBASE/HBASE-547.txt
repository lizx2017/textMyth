Summary:
UI shows hadoop version, not hbase version
Description:
Running a 0.1.0 hbase, I see this as version in UI:
Version 0.16.0, r618351 Hbase version and svn revision
Looks like the version is properly updated but the jsp needs to be regenerated for it to show.
Fix by integrating jsp build into general build.
