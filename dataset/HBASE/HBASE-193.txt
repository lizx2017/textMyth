Summary:
[hbase] End key is incorrectly assigned in many region splits
Description:
When a region is split, the new child region for the upper half of the key range is always assigned as null (meaning end of table). If splits only happen at the end of the table, this is harmless. However under a random write load, an inner region is just as likely to split.
This would explain why we have seen cases where after a split, there are multiple regions whose end key is the end of the table (null)
