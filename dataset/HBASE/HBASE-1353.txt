Summary:
hbase-1234 made the regex filter tests untenable; they've been deprecated till redone/cleaned-up
Description:
The regex filters are odd in a world of byte arrays. This is brought home in the world of KeyValue – hbase-1234 – where we are going out of our way to avoid Object creations. The regex fitlers are extremely expensive to run. The regex filters should be redone otherwise or at least get some attention to clean them up.
