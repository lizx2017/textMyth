Summary:
[hbase] TestRegionServerAbort failure in patch build #903 and nightly #266
Description:
In patch build #903, the metascanner keeps trying to go to the downed server even though onlineMetaRegions has been updated w/ new location and then the metascanner just goes away (or hangs).
In nightly build #266, its a similar scenario only the remaining region servers decide to shut down because they haven't been able to reach the master in 7 seconds.
