Summary:
useTableNameGlobally is not initialized for ReaderV2
Description:
SchemaMetrics.useTableNameGlobally is a Boolean object that is not initialized. It depends on public static method configureGlobally() to initialize it based on the configuration file. But this is only done for writer, not for reader. So when invoking hfile tool,
hbase/bin/hbase org.apache.hadoop.hbase.io.hfile.HFile -v -f YourFile
where HFileReaderV2 is invoked, it throws exception complaining the flag is null.
