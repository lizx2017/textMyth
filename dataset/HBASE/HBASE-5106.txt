Summary:
HBASE-3065 recoverable ZooKeeper, the new metadata introduced setData call breaks old hbase client.
Description:
Old hbase client which talks to the new hbase server could not understand the new metadata. We should re-think how to check setData BADVERSION error.
How about we check the full actual data? If the actual data in ZK is what we want to set, then we are good. Of course, this data could be set actually by someone else, in this case, is it safe not to throw a KeeperException?
