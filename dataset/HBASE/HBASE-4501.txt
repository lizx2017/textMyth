Summary:
[replication] Shutting down a stream leaves recovered sources running
Description:
When removing a peer it will call ReplicationSourceManager.removePeer which calls closeRecoveredQueue which does this:
LOG.info("Done with the recovered queue " + src.getPeerClusterZnode());
this.oldsources.remove(src);
this.zkHelper.deleteSource(src.getPeerClusterZnode(), false);
This works in the case where the recovered source is done and is calling this method, but when removing a peer it never calls terminate on thus it leaving it running.
