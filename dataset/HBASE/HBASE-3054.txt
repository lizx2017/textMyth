Summary:
Remore TestEmptyMetaInfo; it doesn't make sense any more.
Description:
At the head of the TestEmptyMetaInfo it says "TODO: Does this test make sense any more?"
Its a test that checks that the basescanner when it runs cleans up weirdly incomplete rows in .META.
We don't really have a scanner any more and the thing we have, does not do this kinda cleaning anyways so this test is testing something removed.
i'm removing the test. Its a mess anyways based on TestEmptyMetaInfo. It just started failing too.
