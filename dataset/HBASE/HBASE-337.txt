Summary:
[hbase] Performance: HStore.getRowKeyAtOrBefore should use MapFile.Reader#getClosest (before)
Description:
Once HADOOP-2532 is committed, we should make use of the new MapFile method to improve the performance of getClosestRow. This is an important improvement, because this method is used to look up region locations, a very critical part of HBase. Currently, the needed behavior is simulated by doing a linear scan of the MapFile. I think that 2532 will allow us to replace this with an index based lookup, which should make it much faster.
