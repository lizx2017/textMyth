Summary:
[IHBASE] Idx memory allocation fix
Description:
Idx memory allocation fix
Includes a modification to core - MemStore was added with a numKeyValues query
It optimizes the number of memory allocation required to rebuild the index. This is a major fix - it reduces the heap fragmentation and helped postpone/fix (not yet sure which of those) the region server crashing due to those long GC periods on a write-intensive setup
