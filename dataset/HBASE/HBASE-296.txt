Summary:
When a region server dies, its log must be distributed to all the new servers that have been assigned its regions
Description:
When a region server dies, the master reallocates all the regions it was serving to other region servers. In order for the regions to be recovered properly, the log from the old region server must be split up into chunks that contain only the commits for a single region.
Ideally, if a region server is assigned more than one of the old servers regions, the log for that server would contain all the commits for all the regions it has been assigned.
