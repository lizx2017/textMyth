Summary:
[0.92 UNIT TESTS] TestMasterZKSessionRecovery.testRegionAssignmentAfterMasterRecoveryDueToZKExpiry failed in 0.92 #513 and #496
Description:
The test class TestMasterZKSessionRecovery has been removed in trunk. Its master tests were moved elsewhere or removed because useless (See nkeywal reasoning over in HBASE-5572 "KeeperException.SessionExpiredException management could be improved in Master"; it was actually removed by HBASE-5549 "Master can fail if ZooKeeper session expires").
TestMasterZKSessionRecovery in 0.92 and 0.94 has an extra test that was not in trunk, the sporadically failing testRegionAssignmentAfterMasterRecoveryDueToZKExpiry. This was added by "HBASE-6046
Master retry on ZK session expiry causes inconsistent region assignments".
