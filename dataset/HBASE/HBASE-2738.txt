Summary:
Fix TestTimeRangeMapRed verification now that we store multiple versions with same TS
Description:
We recently introduced "memstore timestamps" which are internal, and allow a cell to exist twice with the same timestamp, from different puts. TestTimeRangeMapred now fails since it sees both the old and new version of the cells during verification. Setting the max versions of the verification scanner to 1 fixes it.
