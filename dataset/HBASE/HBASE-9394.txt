Summary:
[replication] size accounting is completely off in the source
Description:
I was under the impression that I was sending way more data than I was expecting, so adding some more tracing I can see how much data I read VS how I much I think I'm sending:
Seeking at position 163771687
Replicating 2 entries of total size 2790
Seeking at position 166723643
That's about 2MB of data, not 2KB.
