Summary:
Retaining locality after restart broken
Description:
In DefaultLoadBalancer, we implement the "retain assignment" function like so:
      if (sn != null && servers.contains(sn)) {
        assignments.get(sn).add(region.getKey());
but this will never work since after a cluster restart, all servers have a new ServerName with a new startcode.
