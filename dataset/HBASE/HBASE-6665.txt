Summary:
ROOT region should not be splitted even with META row as explicit split key
Description:
split operation on ROOT table by specifying explicit split key as .META.
closing the ROOT region and taking long time to fail the split before rollback.
I think we can skip split for ROOT table as how we are doing for META region.
