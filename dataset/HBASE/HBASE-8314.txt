Summary:
HLogSplitter can retry to open a 0-length hlog file
Description:
In case a HLog file is of size 0, and it is under recovery, HLogSplitter will fail to open it since it can get the file length, therefore, master can't start.
java.io.IOException: Cannot obtain block length for LocatedBlock{...; getBlockSize()=0; corrupt=false; offset=0; locs=[...]}
