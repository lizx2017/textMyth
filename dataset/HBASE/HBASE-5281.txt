Summary:
Should a failure in creating an unassigned node abort the master?
Description:
In AssignmentManager's CreateUnassignedAsyncCallback, we have the following condition:
if (rc != 0) {
        // Thisis resultcode.  If non-zero, need to resubmit.
        LOG.warn("rc != 0 for " + path + " -- retryable connectionloss -- " +
          "FIX see http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/ZooKeeper/FAQ#A2");
        this.zkw.abort("Connectionloss writing unassigned at " + path +
          ", rc=" + rc, null);
        return;
}
While a similar structure inside ExistsUnassignedAsyncCallback (which the above is linked to), does not have such a force abort.
Do we really require the abort statement here, or can we make do without?
