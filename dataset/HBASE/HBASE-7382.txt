Summary:
Port ZK.multi support from HBASE-6775 to 0.96
Description:
HBASE-6775 adds support for ZK.multi ZKUtil and uses it for the 0.92/0.94 compatibility fix implemented in HBASE-6710.
ZK.multi support is most likely useful in 0.96, but since HBASE-6710 is not relevant for 0.96, perhaps we should find another use case first before we port.
