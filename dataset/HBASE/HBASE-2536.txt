Summary:
blocking store files count should be per-store, not per-region
Description:
The hbase.hstore.blockingStoreFiles threshold is currently across the entire region, which means that if the number of column families multiplied by hbase.hstore.compactionThreshold is greater than the threshold, writes will freeze up, since we neither flush nor compact.
We should set this threshold per store, not per region, probably.
