Summary:
ensure replication_scope's value is either local(0) or global(1)
Description:
For replication_scope, only two values are meaningful:
 
  public static final int REPLICATION_SCOPE_LOCAL = 0;
  public static final int REPLICATION_SCOPE_GLOBAL = 1;
However, there is no checking for that, so currently user can set it to any integer value. And all non-zero value will be treated as 1(GLOBAL).
This jira is to add a checking in HColumnDescriptor#setScope() so that only 0 and 1 will be accept during create_table or alter_table.
In the future, we can leverage replication_scope to store for info. For example:
-1: A columnfam is replicated from another cluster in MASTER_SLAVE setup (i.e readonly)
2 : A columnfam is set MASTER_MASTER
Probably a major improve JIRA is needed for the future usage. It will be good to ensure the scope value at this moment.
