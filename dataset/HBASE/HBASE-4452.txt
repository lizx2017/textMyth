Summary:
Possibility of RS opening a region though tickleOpening fails due to znode version mismatch
Description:
Consider the following code
    long period = Math.max(1, assignmentTimeout/ 3);
    long lastUpdate = now;
    while (!signaller.get() && t.isAlive() && !this.server.isStopped() &&
        !this.rsServices.isStopping() && (endTime > now)) {
      long elapsed = now - lastUpdate;
      if (elapsed > period) {
        // Only tickle OPENING if postOpenDeployTasks is taking some time.
        lastUpdate = now;
        tickleOpening("post_open_deploy");
      }
Whenever the postopenDeploy tasks takes considerable time we try to tickleOpening so that there is no timeout deducted. But before it could do this if the TimeoutMonitor tries to assign the node to another RS then the other RS will move the node from OFFLINE to OPENING. Hence when the first RS tries to do tickleOpening the operation will fail. Now here lies the problem,
    String encodedName = this.regionInfo.getEncodedName();
    try {
      this.version =
        ZKAssign.retransitionNodeOpening(server.getZooKeeper(),
          this.regionInfo, this.server.getServerName(), this.version);
    } catch (KeeperException e) {
Now this.version becomes -1 as the operation failed.
Now as in the first code snippet as the return type is not captured after tickleOpening() fails we go on with moving the node to OPENED. Here again we dont have any check for this condition as already the version has been changed to -1. Hence the OPENING to OPENED becomes successful. Chances of double assignment.

Correct me if this analysis is wrong.
