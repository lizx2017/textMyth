Summary:
Region stuck in OPENED state
Description:
I don't 100% understand how this happened, but the following was observed:
META is in OPENED state in ZK, for a server which no longer exists
Handler sees that server is dead, and figures that the RIT timeout will handle it
RIT timeout sees that it's already in OPENED state, and assumes that the OPENED handler will handle it
loops in timeout state forever, never actually getting reassigned
