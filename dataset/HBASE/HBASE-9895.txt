Summary:
0.96 Import utility can't import an exported file from 0.94
Description:
Basically we PBed org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.Result so a 0.96 cluster cannot import 0.94 exported files. This issue is annoying because a user can't import his old archive files after upgrade or archives from others who are using 0.94.
The ideal way is to catch deserialization error and then fall back to 0.94 format for importing.
