Summary:
Implement a cancel for in-progress compactions
Description:
Depending on current server load, it can be extremely expensive to run periodic minor / major compactions. It would be helpful to have a feature where a user could use the shell or a client tool to explicitly cancel an in-progress compactions. This would allow a system to recover when too many regions became eligible for compactions at once
