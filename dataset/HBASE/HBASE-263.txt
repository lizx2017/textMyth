Summary:
[hbase] Scanning, a region can let out a row that its not supposed to have
Description:
Bryan's lazy cache patch was provoking a strange issue in TestTableIndex when flush size was small – 64k instead of 1MB – where a scan was returning random rows twice, w/ the second incidence coming out of a region whose range shouldn't even contain the row.
After study, HalfMapFiles serving the top half of a parent region down in the daughter, can have rows in excess of the region endkey; scanning, the call to next will just return these rows w/ consideration of whether beyond region endkey.
