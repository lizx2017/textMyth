Summary:
HRegion runs HStore memcache snapshotting -- fix it so only HStore knows about workings of memcache
Description:
HRegion needs to keep count of memcache sizes. Currently its trying to run the memcaches snapshots so it can keep up this number. HRegion should know nothing about no memcache snapshotting â€“ should be internal to flushing ... especially since HBASE-532 fix. HRegion can ask for store sizes.... Add that.
