Summary:
[tools] Tool to kick region out of inTransistion
Description:
It seems fairly easy getting a region stuck "inTransitions" (See recent filings of mine). Also, with addition to ClusterStatus of intransitions content, you can see this state now when you do analysis. I want to roll RC2. 0.20.0 still has issues and we even know now what the worst of them are but the fixes can wait till 0.20.1. Meantime, I need a means of bumping stuff that is stuck from the intransistions.... for 0.20.0 release in case we trip over this scenario for then we can effect a repair at least. Otherwise, requires restart of cluster.
