Summary:
Default hbase.dynamic.jars.dir to hbase.rootdir/jars
Description:
A reasonable default for hbase.dynamic.jars.dir would be hbase.rootdir/jars so that folks aren't forced to edit their hbase-sites.xml to take advantage of the new, cool feature to load coprocessor/custom filter jars out of HDFS.
