Summary:
Hbase should use a HADOOP_HOME environment variable if available.
Description:
I have been burned a few times lately while developing code by having the make sure that the hadoop jar in hbase/lib is exactly correct. In my own deployment, there are actually 3 jars and a native library to keep in sync that hbase shouldn't have to know about explicitly. A similar problem arises when using stock hbase with CDH3 because of the security patches changing the wire protocol.
All of these problems could be avoided by not assuming that the hadoop library is in the local directory. Moreover, I think it might be possible to assemble the distribution such that the compile time hadoop dependency is in a cognate directory to lib and is referenced using a default value for HADOOP_HOME.
Does anybody have any violent antipathies to such a change?
