Summary:
Odd interaction between HRegion.get, HRegion.deleteAll and compactions
Description:
If you apply the patch for HBASE-483 to the 0.1 branch and comment out lines 309 and 315 of MetaUtils.java (which force compactions of the root and meta regions respectively), TestMergeTool fails. Why forcing compactions makes the test succeed is a mystery to me.
