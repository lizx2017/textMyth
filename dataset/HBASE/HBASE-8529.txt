Summary:
checkOpen is missing from multi, mutate, get and multiGet etc.
Description:
I saw we have checkOpen in all those functions in 0.94 while they're missing from trunk. Does anyone know why?
For multi and mutate, if we don't call checkOpen we could flood our logs with bunch of "DFSOutputStream is closed" errors when we sync WAL.
