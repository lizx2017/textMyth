Summary:
Fix source files missing licenses in 0.92 and trunk
Description:
running 'mvn rat:check' shows that a few files have snuck in that do not have proper apache licenses. Ideally we should fix these before we cut another release/release candidate.
This is a blocker for 0.94, and probably should be for the other branches as well.
