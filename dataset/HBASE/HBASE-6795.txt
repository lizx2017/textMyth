Summary:
mvn compile fails on a fresh checkout with empty ~/.m2/repo
Description:
I have noticed that mvn compile fails if your ~/m2/repository/ does not contain hbase test jars, however mvn test-compile, mvn install, etc works as expected.
The patch for HBASE-6706 introduced test-jar dependency from hbase-server and hbase-hadoop1-compat to hbase-hadoop-compat test jar in the test scope. But stupid maven still tries to resolve the test jar when you do maven compile (notice that we are not even in the test scope).
mvn test-compile, etc works b/c the test-jar for hbase-hadoop-compat is build before hbase-hadoop1-compat.
One way to solve this is to push SNAPSHOT test-jars for hbase-hadoop-compat to the snapshot repository, so next time, they are referenced from there.
Other alternative is to move classes under hbase-hadoop
{|1|2}
-compat/src/test to src/main, and remove the test-jar intra-module dependency. Still, it seems we might need intra-module test-jar dependency in the future.
Any other suggestions are welcome.
