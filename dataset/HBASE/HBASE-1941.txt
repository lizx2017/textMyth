Summary:
Put's copy feature has a bug.
Description:
Put's copy feature has a bug. The copy does not consider the timestamp value.
In the following example, a put and its copied put prints out different timestamps.
Put put = new Put("abc".getBytes());
put.setTimeStamp(1);
System.out.println(put.getTimeStamp());
Put put2 = new Put(put);
System.out.println(put2.getTimeStamp());
