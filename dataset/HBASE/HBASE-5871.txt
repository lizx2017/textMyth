Summary:
Usability regression, we don't parse compression algos anymore
Description:
It seems that string with 0.92.0 we can't create tables in the shell by specifying "lzo" anymore. I remember we used to do better parsing than that, but right now if you follow the wiki doing this:
create 'mytable', {NAME=>'colfam:', COMPRESSION=>'lzo'}
You'll get:
ERROR: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: No enum const class org.apache.hadoop.hbase.io.hfile.Compression$Algorithm.lzo
Bad for usability.
