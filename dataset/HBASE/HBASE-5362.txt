Summary:
ZK connection leak
Description:
I have an application like a scheduler that starts periodically some MR jobs that reads from one HBase table and write in more tables, changing the row key and the columns list.
I have encounted a problem with this: after each MR job, I have +1 connections open to ZK and after a period of time, I have received IOException. I saw that I am not the first that had had this problem, but I didn't see any fix. No in HBase 0.90.4, nor in HBase 0.92.
To fix this issue I wrote a custom TableInputFormat that forces to close the connection to ZK after each getSplits call.
Also, the initTableMapperJob was overwritten.
I found an open JIRA issue here: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-3792

Ionut I.
