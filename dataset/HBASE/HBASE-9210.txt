Summary:
"hbase shell -d" doesn't print out exception stack trace
Description:
when starting shell with "-d" specified, the following line doesn't print anything because debug isn't set when shell is constructed.
"Backtrace: #{e.backtrace.join("\n           ")}" if debug
In addition, the existing code prints the outer most exception while we normally need the root cause exception.
