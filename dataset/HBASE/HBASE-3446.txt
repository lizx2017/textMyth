Summary:
ProcessServerShutdown fails if META moves, orphaning lots of regions
Description:
I ran a rolling restart on a 5 node cluster with lots of regions, and afterwards had LOTS of regions left orphaned. The issue appears to be that ProcessServerShutdown failed because the server hosting META was restarted around the same time as another server was being processed
