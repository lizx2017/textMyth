Summary:
we will lose data if the table name happens to be the logs' dir name
Description:
If the tablename happens to equal with the logs' dir name of a certain regionserver, the table will store table's data into the same dir in HDFS shared with the regionserver's log dir. If the specified region server fails, the dir may be removed after the logs are replayed. And here, we lose the data.
I suggest that a special char like '_' could be added before the logdir's name, just as what root region and meta region have done. So we can prevent the user table's data from being stored in a log dir. for example, 'log_10.132.15.1_1231465024534_60020' will be changed to '_log_10.132.15.1_1231465024534_60020'.
