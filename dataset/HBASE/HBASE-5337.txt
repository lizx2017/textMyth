Summary:
AM.updateTimers() delays the timeout monitor from assigning regions.
Description:
AM.updateTimers() is necessary when the new RS has joined the cluster and there are more regions to be assigned to it. The updateTimer will help the TM from not picking up these regions because they are still in the process of assignment.
But if in 0.90 we have 30min as TM period then this step of updating the timers further delays the assignment.
I think we can remove the call for updateTimer in 0.90 till we decide to change the TM period.
