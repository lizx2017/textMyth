Summary:
MiniHBaseCluster.shutdown() doesn't work if no active master
Description:
Running tests over in HBASE-4014 brought up this issue. If the active master in a MiniHBaseCluster has aborted, then calling MiniHBaseCluster.shutdown() will just hang in JVMClusterUtil.shutdown(), waiting to join each of the region server threads.
Seems like we should explicitly stop each region server instead of just relying on an active master instance deleting the cluster status znode?
