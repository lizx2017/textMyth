Summary:
hbase-policy.xml is improperly set thus all rules in it can be by-passed
Description:
This should be a code error.
In HBasePolicyProvider.java, hbase-policy.xml file was set as,
conf.set("hadoop.policy.file", "hbase-policy.xml");
But in Hadoop ServiceAuthorizationManager.java, policy file was get as,
String policyFile =
System.getProperty("hadoop.policy.file", HADOOP_POLICY_FILE);
The result is, the mentioned hbase-policy.xml file won't be used, and
default hadoop-policy.xml file can be used, which is unexpected.
