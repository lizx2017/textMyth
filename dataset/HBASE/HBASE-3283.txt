Summary:
NPE in AssignmentManager if processing shutdown of RS who doesn't have any regions assigned to it
Description:
When doing server shutdown, we do the following:
deadRegions = new TreeSet<HRegionInfo>(this.servers.remove(hsi));
This removes the list of regions currently assigned to the specified server from the master in-memory state. But it's possible that the remove returns null (have seen it in running production cluster).
We should check if this is null and just return if so.
