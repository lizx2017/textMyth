Summary:
RS does not abort if the initialization of RS fails
Description:
If any exception occurs while initialization of RS the RS doesnot get
aborted whereas only the RPC server gets stopped.
private void preRegistrationInitialization()
throws IOException, InterruptedException {
try {
initializeZooKeeper();
initializeThreads();
int nbBlocks = conf.getInt("hbase.regionserver.nbreservationblocks",4);
for (int i = 0; i < nbBlocks; i++)
{ reservedSpace.add(new byte[HConstants.DEFAULT_SIZE_RESERVATION_BLOCK]); }
} catch (Throwable t)
{ // Call stop if error or process will stick around for ever since server // puts up non-daemon threads. LOG.error("Stopping HRS because failed initialize", t); this.rpcServer.stop(); }
}
So if any exception occurs while initilization the RPC server gets stopped
but RS process is still running. But the log says stopping HRegionServer.
So in the below code the catch() block will be executed when the RPCServer
stop fails?
In all other cases it doesnt handle any initialization failure.
try
{ // Do pre-registration initializations; zookeeper, lease threads,tc. preRegistrationInitialization(); }
catch (Exception e)
{ abort("Fatal exception during initialization", e); }
