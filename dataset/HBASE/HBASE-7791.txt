Summary:
Compaction USER_PRIORITY is slightly broken
Description:
The code to get compaction priority is as such:
   public int getCompactPriority(int priority) {
     // If this is a user-requested compaction, leave this at the highest priority
     if(priority == Store.PRIORITY_USER) {
       return Store.PRIORITY_USER;
     } else {
       return this.blockingStoreFileCount - this.storefiles.size();
     }
   }
.
PRIORITY_USER is 1.
The priorities are compared as numbers in HRegion, so compactions of blocking stores will override user priority (probably intended); also, if you have blockingFiles minus one, your priority is suddenly PRIORITY_USER, which may cause at least this:
LOG.debug("Warning, compacting more than " + comConf.getMaxFilesToCompact() +
" files because of a user-requested major compaction");
as well as some misleading logging.
