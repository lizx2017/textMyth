Summary:
Master clean start up and Partially enabled tables make region assignment inconsistent.
Description:
If we have a table in partially enabled state (ENABLING) then on HMaster restart we treat it as a clean cluster start up and do a bulk assign. Currently in 0.94 bulk assign will not handle ALREADY_OPENED scenarios and it leads to region assignment problems. Analysing more on this we found that we have better way to handle these scenarios.
if (false == checkIfRegionBelongsToDisabled(regionInfo)
            && false == checkIfRegionsBelongsToEnabling(regionInfo)) {
          synchronized (this.regions) {
            regions.put(regionInfo, regionLocation);
            addToServers(regionLocation, regionInfo);
          }
We dont add to regions map so that enable table handler can handle it. But as nothing is added to regions map we think it as a clean cluster start up.
Will come up with a patch tomorrow.
