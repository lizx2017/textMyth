Summary:
[0.94] Backport HBASE-8449,HBASE-8204 and HBASE-8699 to 0.94 (Refactor recoverLease retries and pauses)
Description:
Some history:
Up until 0.94.8, Hbase did not check the result of recoverLease() call, but things kind of worked since we are checking for 0-length files in distributed log split tasks from region servers. If lease recovery is not finished, the log file will report 0 length, and the task will fail, and master will then re-call recoverLease() and reassign the task. This scheme might fail for log files that are larger than 1 hdfs block though.
In 0.94.8, we committed (HBASE-8354, which is backport of HBASE-7878) and later increased the sleep time to 4 secs in HBASE-8389.
However, the proper solution arrived in trunk in HBASE-8449 which uses a backoff sleep policy + isFileClosed() api. We should backport this patch to 0.94 as well.
isFileClosed() is released in Hadoop 1.2.0 (HDFS-4774) and 2.0.5(HDFS-4525).
