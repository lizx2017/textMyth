Summary:
[hbase] Separate MapFile benchmark from PerformanceEvaluation
Description:
Although related to Hbase the MapFile benchmark in PerformanceEvaluation does not use Hbase to run, and sits awkwardly in the PerformanceEvaluation class. It should be broken out into its own class. This would also make it easier in the future to run the MapFile performance tests independently of one another (as PerformanceEvaluation does).
