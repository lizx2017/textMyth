Summary:
Incorrect dependency on Log class from Jetty
Description:
There are a few dependencies on the class org.mortbay.log.Log which is a bug:
21:05 < dj_ryan> we should not depend on that logging framework
21:05 < dj_ryan> at all
21:05 < dj_ryan> ever
I could find it in use in these classes:
org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.ScannerCallable
org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.TestHCM
org.apache.hadoop.hbase.mapreduce.Export
org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.wal.SequenceFileLogReader
