Summary:
TableOperation doesnt format keys for meta scan properly
Description:
to scan the meta table, the start row must be in the format 'table_name,,' - the commas are not optional.
I found another place in TableOperation which was missing this, causing hbase to close too many regions from unrelated tables (ouch!)
