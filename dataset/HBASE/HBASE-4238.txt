Summary:
CatalogJanitor can clear a daughter that split before processing its parent
Description:
I didn't dig a lot into this issue, but by splitting a table twice in a row I was able to trigger a situation where a daughter of the first split was deleted by the CatalogJanitor before it processed its parent. Will post log in a comment.
