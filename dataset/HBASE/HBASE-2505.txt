Summary:
Master doesn't handle IOEs well when splitting logs at startup
Description:
Was just testing the 0.20.4rc5 on a cluster that had a newer format of log files and noticed this:
If an IOE occurs splitting one log, it will not continue trying to split other logs
the IOEs are logged to stdout, not to log4j
