Summary:
HBase shell assign and unassign unusable if region name includes binary-encoded data
Description:
When using the hbase shell assign and unassign commands, we should be able to copy region names from the hbck utility or the web page hosted by the HMaster process. But if these names have encoded binary data, they region name won't match and the command will fail.
This is easily fixed by using Bytes.toBytesBinary on the region name in these commands rather than the raw Bytes.ToBytes.
