Summary:
Client should not look on HDFS to list tables
Description:
In HBASE-4377, Jon noticed that HConnectionManager.listTable now looks on HDFS for the table list. This seems incorrect, since the client may not have access to the hbase directory on HDFS (eg in a secure cluster). At the least, it should RPC to the master to find a table list, and have the master do the list on HDFS.
