Summary:
List of dependency jars for MR jobs is hard-coded and does not include netty, breaking MRv1 jobs
Description:
Observed behavior:
Against trunk, using MRv1 with hadoop 1.0.4, r1393290, I am able to run MRv1 jobs (e.g. pi 2 4).
However, when I use it to run MR over HBase jobs, they fail with the stack trace below.
From the trace, the issue seems to be that it cannot find a class that the netty jar contains. This would make sense, given that the dependency jars that we use for the MapReduce job are hard-coded, and that the netty jar is not one of them.
https://github.com/apache/hbase/blob/trunk/hbase-server/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/mapreduce/TableMapReduceUtil.java#L519
Strangely, this is only an issue in trunk, not 0.95, even though the code hasn't changed.
Command:
/bin/hbase org.apache.hadoop.hbase.mapreduce.RowCounter sampletable

Expected behavior:
As a stopgap, the netty jar should be included in that list. More generally, there should be a more elegant way to include the jars that are needed.
