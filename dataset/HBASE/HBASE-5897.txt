Summary:
prePut coprocessor hook causing substantial CPU usage
Description:
I was running an insert workload against trunk under oprofile and saw that a significant portion of CPU usage was going to calling the "prePut" coprocessor hook inside doMiniBatchPut, even though I don't have any coprocessors installed. I ran a million-row insert and collected CPU time spent in the RS after commenting out the preput hook, and found CPU usage reduced by 33%.
