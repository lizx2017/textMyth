Summary:
Avoid local results copy in StoreScanner
Description:
In StoreScanner the number of results is limited to avoid OOMs.
However, this is done by first adding the KV into a local ArrayList and then copying the entries in this list to the final result list.
In turns out the this temporary list is only used to keep track of the size of the result set in this loop. Can use a simple int instead.
