Summary:
PerformanceEvaluation generates 10x the number of expected mappers
Description:
With a command line like 'hbase org.apache.hadoop.hbase.PerformanceEvaluation randomWrite 10' there are 100 mappers spawned, rather than the expected 10. The culprit appears to be the outer loop in writeInputFile which sets up 10 splits for every "asked-for client". I think the fix is just to remove that outer loop.
