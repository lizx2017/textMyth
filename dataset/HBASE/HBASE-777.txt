Summary:
Tables created from 0.2.0 shell aren't loadably by using the HTable "Text" constructor
Description:
Using the old shell I was able to use CREATE TABLE to create a table named 'RelatedAlbums' and then access it from Java using new HTable(conf, new Text("RelatedAlbums")).
Using the new shell, trying to use 'create' from the irb shell and then that same constructor results in the table not being found.
