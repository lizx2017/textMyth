Summary:
Action should not store or serialize regionName
Description:
Action stores the regionName, BUT an action comes from a MultiAction, which contains:
public Map<byte[], List<Action<R>>> actions
Which means we are storing the regionName multiple times. In fact, no one even calls the accessor getRegionName!
It changes the serialization of Action and MultiAction, but reduces the byte overhead.
