Summary:
mvn site fails without install first
Description:
mvn site fails on hadoopqa runs, and also on fresh checkouts. The problem seems to be that mvn site somehow does not trigger a correct reactor ordering. hbase-server is built before other components, and thus throws dependency errors because the other modules are not build yet.
An example from https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HBASE-Build/7491//consoleFull:
/home/jenkins/tools/maven/latest/bin/mvn compile site -DskipTests -DHBasePatchProcess > /home/jenkins/jenkins-slave/workspace/PreCommit-HBASE-Build/patchprocess/patchSiteOutput.txt 2>&1
