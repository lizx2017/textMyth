Summary:
HRI.getRegionName/AsString are inconsistent for regions with the old encoding scheme
Description:
HRI.getRegionName and getRegionNameAsString don't give consistent results for regions created with the old encoding scheme. See Aravind's comment in HBASE-5929 on how a region was appended with ".1290583321" when its HRI was queried with getRegionNameAsString and, once passed to HBA, wasn't able to compact it (I checked .META. and it doesn't have that last part so it must come from getRegionName).
This one might be a little hard to fix if we're already dependent on the broken behavior of getRegionName.
