Summary:
getRowsWithColumnsTs() in Thrift service handles timestamps incorrectly
Description:
The getRowsWithColumnsTs() method in the Thrift interface only applies the timestamp if columns are explicitly specified. However, this method also allows for columns to be unspecified (this is even used internally to implement e.g. getRows()). The cause of the bug is a minor scoping issue: the time range is set inside a wrong if statement.
