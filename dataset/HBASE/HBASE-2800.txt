Summary:
TestMergeMeta fails in hudson, not so on local workstations (trunk)
Description:
TestMergeMeta and TestMergeTool both fail in hudson yet pass on local workstations. Looking at the error for TestMergeMeta, the test complains '.META.' is online and thus cannot merge, but according to the code, these regions are being closed after they were created, and the mini HBase cluster is not started.
