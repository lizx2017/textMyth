Summary:
hbase-3872 added a warn message 'CatalogJanitor: Daughter regiondir does not exist' that is triggered though its often legit that daughter is not present
Description:
If a daughter region is split before the catalog janitor runs, we'll see:
2011-07-22 16:10:26,398 WARN org.apache.hadoop.hbase.master.CatalogJanitor: Daughter regiondir does not exist: hdfs://sv4borg227:10000/hbase/TestTable/a1023b2b00fe44c86bd8ae3633f531fa
Its legit that the daughter region does not exist in this case (it was just cleaned up by the catalogjanitor).
