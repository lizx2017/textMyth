Summary:
Provide new non-copy mechanism to assure atomic reads in get and scan
Description:
HBASE-2037 introduced a new MemStoreScanner which triggers a ConcurrentSkipListMap.buildFromSorted clone of the memstore and snapshot when starting a scan.
After upgrading to 0.20.3, we noticed a big slowdown in our use of short scans. Some of our data repesent a time series. The data is stored in time series order, MR jobs often insert/update new data at the end of the series, and queries usually have to pick up some or all of the series. These are often scans of 0-100 rows at a time. To load one page, we'll observe about 20 such scans being triggered concurrently, and they take 2 seconds to complete. Doing a thread dump of a region server shows many threads in ConcurrentSkipListMap.biuldFromSorted which traverses the entire map of key values to copy it.
