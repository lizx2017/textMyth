Summary:
UI listing regions should be sorted by address and show additional region state
Description:
Currently, looking at a cluster under load, you'll often trip over the disorientating listing of more than one region with a null end key (Was seen by Billy yesterday and psaab today). UI should list out all of its attributes.
Also sort region listings by server address so easier finding servers.
