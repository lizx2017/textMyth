Summary:
[WINDOWS] MiniZookeeperCluster should ensure that ZKDatabase is closed upon shutdown()
Description:
MiniZookeeperCluster.shutdown() shuts down the ZookeeperServer and NIOServerCnxnFactory. However, MiniZookeeperCluster uses a deprecated ZookeeperServer constructor, which in turn constructs its own FileTxnSnapLog, and ZKDatabase. Since ZookeeperServer.shutdown() does not close() the ZKDatabase, we have to explicitly close it in MiniZookeeperCluster.shutdown().
