Summary:
Master failing when node disconnects or dies
Description:
We've got our servers running on Amazon EC2 and nodes will go through some shutdown scripts if/when we want to take them out of the mix. Ended up shutting down one of the nodes, in this case Node98, which cased the immediate crash of the master server. Upon restarting the master, it would attempt to contact the missing node, and then stop it's startup process. I believe the node removed itself from the DNS server first, then ran a stop on the datanode, and regionserver. The missing node was also removed from any slave/regionserver list on the master server. I finally put in a bogus entry in the /etc/hosts file for the missing node, pointing it back to 127.0.0.1, and the master server finally marked it as a dead node, ignored it, and finished the startup process.
Going to try and replicate it again and save some more logs, the following log is the only thing I saved from the first occurrence; It's the master failing to start up while checking for the missing node: http://pastebin.com/ZyQMQm91
