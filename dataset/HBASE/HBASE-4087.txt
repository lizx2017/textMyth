Summary:
HBaseAdmin should perform validation of connection it holds
Description:
Through HBASE-3777, HConnectionManager reuses the connection to HBase servers.
One challenge, discovered in troubleshooting HBASE-4052, is how we invalidate connection(s) to server which gets restarted.
There're at least two ways.
1. HConnectionManager utilizes background thread(s) to periodically perform validation of connections in HBASE_INSTANCES and remove stale connection(s).
2. Allow HBaseClient (including HBaseAdmin) to provide feedback to HConnectionManager.
The solution can be a combination of both of the above.
