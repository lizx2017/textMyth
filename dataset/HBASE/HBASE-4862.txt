Summary:
Splitting hlog and opening region concurrently may cause data loss
Description:
Case Description:
1.Split hlog thread creat writer for the file region A/recoverd.edits/123456 and is appending log entry
2.Regionserver is opening region A now, and in the process replayRecoveredEditsIfAny() ,it will delete the file region A/recoverd.edits/123456
3.Split hlog thread catches the io exception, and stop parse this log file
and if skipError = true , add it to the corrupt logs....However, data in other regions in this log file will loss
4.Or if skipError = false, it will check filesystem.Of course, the file system is ok , and it only prints a error log, continue assigning regions. Therefore, data in other log files will also loss!!
The case may happen in the following:
1.Move region from server A to server B
2.kill server A and Server B
3.restart server A and Server B
We could prevent this exception throuth forbiding deleting recover.edits file
which is appending by split hlog thread
