Summary:
[Hbase] Caching for read performance
Description:
Use two level of caching to improve read performance
Scan cache
Higher-level cache
Caches the K,V pairs returned by the SSTable(HStore?) interface to the region server code
Most useful for applications that tend to read the same data repeatedly
Block cache
Lower-level cache
Caches SSTables blocks that were read from HDFS
Useful for applications that read data close to the data that they recently read
E.g. Sequential read or random read of different column in same locality group within a hot row
