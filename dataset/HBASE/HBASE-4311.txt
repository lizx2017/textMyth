Summary:
HBaseTestingUtility.createMultiRegions generates table that fails in hbck.
Description:
When refactoring TestHBaseFsckRepair to add more hbck test cases, I noticed that HBaseTestingUtility.createMultiRegions uses an existing table with empty region, adds more regions, and then attempts to remove the region. The region remains in meta and is causes hbck to report at inconsistency. Ideally these test table generation utility functions should generate clean tables.
