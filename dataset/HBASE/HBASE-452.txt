Summary:
"region offline" should throw IOException, not IllegalStateException
Description:
It would be nice if I could wrap my HTable.get calls in try {} catch (IOException e). But that doesn't work, since I also need to catch IllegalStateException. I think that any time there is something wrong with hbase, hbase calls should throw an IOException (or subclass thereof). Things like IllegalStateException should be reserved for programmer error.
