Summary:
After migrating from one cluster to another, new hmaster dies when reaching out to old nodes
Description:
I am migrating from cluster (movetest-a.domain.com to another (movetest-b.domain.com), both at the same version of hdfs/hbase. I am using mozilla's Backup tool to copy the /hbase files, but I imagine any copy tool would have this issue. Each cluster has its own zookeeper & HDFS.
After copying the files, I try to start the new hmaster (movetest-b), and it dies because it cannot resolve the data nodes from the source cluster (eg data01.movetest-a.domain.com).
Log: http://pastie.org/4212244
Things I tried that did not work:
delete ROOT from the copied data
delete .META. from the copied data
cleanly shutdown the source before copying (to flush to disk)
Things I tried that did work:
add the source nodes to /etc/hosts, pointing at 127.0.0.2 (which give connection refused):
127.0.0.2 data01.movetest-a.domain.com data02.movetest-a.domain.com data03.movetest-a.domain.com
After bringing up the new cluster (with /etc/hosts in place), I was able to delete the /etc/hosts entries, and bounce hbase without error.
