Summary:
RegionServers fail to report to backup HMaster after primary goes down.
Description:
Setup cluster with two HMasters
Observe that HM1 is up and that all RS's are in the RegionServer list on web page.
Kill (not even -9) the active HMaster
Wait for ZK to time out (default 3 minutes).
Observe that HM2 is now active. Tables may show up but RegionServers never report on web page. Existing connections are fine. New connections cannot find regionservers.
Note:
If we replace a new HM1 in the same place and kill HM2, the cluster functions normally again after recovery. This sees to indicate that regionservers are stuck trying to talk to the old HM1.
