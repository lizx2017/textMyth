Summary:
[replication] Break out TestReplication into manageable classes
Description:
This has been discussed before but after trying to debug the last failure on Jenkins where I saw the time go back and forth (if you don't care about your own sanity do checkout https://builds.apache.org/job/HBase-TRUNK/3726/testReport/junit/org.apache.hadoop.hbase.replication/TestReplicationWithCompression/testDeleteTypes/) I think it is time to break out TestReplication.
The difficulty is that the setup for the 2 clusters is a lot of code I don't want to duplicate. I'm thinking that we can keep setUpBeforeClass there and have the other classes extend TestReplication (which should also change name). I'm thinking of the following new classes:
TestReplicationSmallTests, contains the easy methods that don't mess around too much.
TestReplicationQueueFailover, contains one test of the same name
TestReplicationDisableInactivePeer, contains one test of the same name
Rename TestReplicationWithCompression TestReplicationQueueFailoverWithCompression and make it extends TestReplicationQueueFailover.
