Summary:
Race between balancer and disable table can lead to inconsistent cluster
Description:
Appear in 94. trunk is ok for the issue
Balancer will collect the regionplans to move(unassign and then assign).
before unassign, disable table appears,
after close the region in rs, master will delete the znode, romove region from RIT,
and then clean the region from the online regions.
During romoving region from RIT and cleaning out the region from the online regions.
balancer begins to unassign, it will get a NotServingRegionException and if the table is disabling, it will deal with the state in master and delete the znode . However the table is disabled now, so the RIT and znode will remain. TimeoutMonitor draws a blank on it.
It will hold back enabling the table or balancer unless restart
