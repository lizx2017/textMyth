Summary:
Cache uses only 2G of heap no matter how much allocated?
Description:
Here is a question from Adam Silberstein who is having trouble writing this list:
"I'm running on a particular cluster of machines and seeing worse than expected performance. I've run on a different, but identical, cluster of machines and gotten about 2-4x better throughput and latency. I've checked all of the configuration settings and they are all the same. The only thing I observe that looks odd is the memory usage by each region server. I've allocated 6 GB heap space to each. There is a total of 20GB of records on each. When I use "top" to observe memory usage, I see that the region server process does have 6GB of virtual memory. When I start running a workload, I can see the amount of resident memory climbing. However, it always stops at 2GB. Since I have 20 GB on each region server, I'd expect the process to use all the memory allocated it
"Is there a reasonable explanation for why it stops at 2GB, and/or has anyone seen this happen"
I took a look at the cache code and I see that it has an int for maximum size in the constructor argument though internally its using a long for maximum size. I wonder if this is the issue?
