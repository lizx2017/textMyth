Summary:
NSRE in lockRow is thrown as an ERROR
Description:
HRS.lockRow doesn't manage exceptions like all the other methods:
    try {
      HRegion region = getRegion(regionName);
      Integer r = region.obtainRowLock(row);
      long lockId = addRowLock(r,region);
      LOG.debug("Row lock " + lockId + " explicitly acquired by client");
      return lockId;
    } catch (Throwable t) {
      throw convertThrowableToIOE(cleanup(t,
        "Error obtaining row lock (fsOk: " + this.fsOk + ")"));
    }
Also it throws a special message and shows if fs is ok, although it already calls checkOpen() at the beginning of that method.
Fix by making it behaving like all the other calls.
