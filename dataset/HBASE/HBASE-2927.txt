Summary:
BaseScanner gets stale HRegionInfo in some race cases
Description:
This issue is a branch of HBASE-2812, as it is a specific fix for disabling tables in some situations. The issue is that the BaseScanner can get a stale HRI by the time it checks if the region is OFFLINE, and even in trunk where we do a double checkAssigned there is no way for us to tell if the region was offlined in the mean time.
