Summary:
HTable unnecessarily coupled with HMaster
Description:
HTable constructor calls "getCurrentNrHRS()" to get the region server count for thread pool creation. This code calls HBaseAdmin.getClusterStatus() [aka: the HMaster] to get the server count. This information can be scraped from counting the ZooKeeper /hbase/rs/--- ZNodes. Need to remove unnecessary master queries when ZooKeeper can do the same job.
