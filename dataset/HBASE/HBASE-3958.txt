Summary:
use Scan with setCaching() and PageFilter have a problem
Description:
I have a table with 3 ranges,then I scan the table cross all 3 ranges.
Scan scan = new Scan();
scan.setCaching(10);
scan.setFilter(new PageFilter(21));
[result rows count = 63]
the Result has 63 rows, each range has scaned,and locally limit to page_szie.That is expect result.
Then if the page_size = N * caching_size, then result has only page_size rows,only the first range has scanned.
If page_size is Multiple of caching_size,one range rsult just align fill the caching,then client NOT trrige next range scan.
Example:
Scan scan = new Scan();
scan.setCaching(10);
scan.setFilter(new PageFilter(20));
[result rows count = 20]
