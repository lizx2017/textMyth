Summary:
CopyTable: Cannot have ZK source to destination
Description:
During a Copy Table, involving --peer.adr, we found the following block of code:
if (address != null)
{ ZKUtil.applyClusterKeyToConf(this.conf, address); }
When we set ZK conf in setConf method, that also gets called in frontend when MR initializes TOF, so there's no way now to have two ZK points for a single job, cause source gets reset before job is submitted.
