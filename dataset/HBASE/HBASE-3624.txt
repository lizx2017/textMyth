Summary:
Only one coprocessor of each priority type can be loaded for a table
Description:
Coprocessors are added to HBase using a TreeSet that is initialized with an EnvironmentPriorityComparator. The net effect is that only one coprocessor of a given priority can be loaded at a time for a given table. This appears to be due to how the TreeSet uses the EnvironmentPriorityComparator to determine whether there are duplicate entries - if the coprocessors have the same priority (e.g., User), they are considered the same and won't be added to the Set.
