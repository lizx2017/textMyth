Summary:
Minor cleanup and fixes for POM
Description:
hbase-client only compiles due to transitive dependencies. It has a lot of undeclared but used dependencies. This patch cleans all those up and formats the pom using the same guidelines as the main one. Without this it won't compile properly in IntelliJ.
hbase-server (and probably the other modules) has similar problems but I'll try to get to those another time.
