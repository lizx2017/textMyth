Summary:
Store doReconstructionLog will fail if oldlogfile.log is empty and won't load region
Description:
doReconstructionLog doesn't handle empty files correctly:
    FileStatus stat = this.fs.getFileStatus(reconstructionLog);
    if (stat.getLen() <= 0) {
      LOG.warn("Passed reconstruction log " + reconstructionLog +
        " is zero-length. Deleting existing file");
       fs.delete(reconstructionLog, false);
      return -1;
    }
Notice it actually compares the length of the array instead of the file length.
It should call getLen() and delete the file afterwards
   FileStatus stat = this.fs.getFileStatus(reconstructionLog);
    if (stat.getLen() <= 0) {
      LOG.warn("Passed reconstruction log " + reconstructionLog +
        " is zero-length. Deleting existing file");
       fs.delete(reconstructionLog, false);
      return -1;
    }
Also. This is a situation that shouldn't happen as an empty oldlogfile.log should be deleted when HMaster does the split in HLog.splitLog().
I couldn't figure what would make it leave it there as I also see in the logs that other empty logs are deleted. This might expose a thornier situation.
