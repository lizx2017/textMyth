Summary:
Tool to look at HLogs -- parse and tail -f
Description:
We need a tool for looking at wals. A tail -f would be sweet though it might be ugly having to open each time it wants to dump next lot of edits out wal log.
From Kannan:
20:45 <kannan> WALEdit already has a toString().
20:46 <kannan> And append/sync support allows you to read concurrently a file that is being written too... (like JDs replication).
20:46 <kannan> So it would be good if I could do a bin/hbase hlogprint -f hdfs://...../.logs/<filename> -v -p
20:46 <kannan> much like the HFile pretty printer... except the HLog one is effectively a tail -f.
