Summary:
[WINDOWS] Tests should not rely on local temp dir to be available in DFS
Description:
Some of the tests resolve the local temp directory for temporary test data, but use this directory path in dfs. Since on windows, local temp dir is resolved to something like: c:
<path_to_local_dir>, DistributedFileSystem.getPathName() throws an IllegalArgumentException complaining that it is not a valid path name.
Instead of relying on a local temp dir name, we should create a temp dir on dfs, and use this as a basis dir for test data.
At least the following test cases are affected by this:
TestHFileOutputFormat
TestHRegionServerBulkLoad
