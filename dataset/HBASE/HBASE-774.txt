Summary:
Optional flush provokes periodic large spike in cluster traffic
Description:
Looking at our 70-node cluster, whose current state is mostly read-only but for a service that is trickling in pages at about 5/600 an hour, network traffic goes through the roof every 30 minutes. This is 0.1.3. Regionserver logs are silent but for the optional flush that runs every 30 minutes. The optional flush will put a few small files out on the filesystem tripping compactions of small files.
