Summary:
CompactionRequest should not be based on regionId, but the encoded name instead
Description:
The compaction state check call of HRegionServer#getCompactionState extracts out the regionId (timestamp) of a region to store/check the compaction state. In usual runtime this is fine, as the timestamp is granular and varied for each region, making it practically unique but in no way should a timestamp be considered unique. A bug that comes out of this semi-bad assumption is that when a user pre-splits their table, the regionId is all the same across all regions created, leading to this check call returning improper values.
The ideal identifier could be the table name + encoded region name, if not the whole HRegionInfo identifier string itself.
Given that the user API just sends a normal identifier which is reevaluated, such a change shouldn't break anything.
