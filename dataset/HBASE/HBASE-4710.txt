Summary:
HBaseRPC$UnknownProtocolException should abort any client retries in HConnectionManager
Description:
While HBaseRPC$UnknownProtocolException currently extends DoNotRetryIOException, it's still allowing retries of client RPCs when encountered in HConnectionManager.getRegionServerWithRetries(). It turns out that UnknownProtocolException is missing a public constructor taking a single String argument, which is required when unwrapping an IOException from a RemoteException in RemoteExceptionHandler.decodeRemoteException().
