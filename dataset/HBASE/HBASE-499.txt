Summary:
TestTableIndex hung on hudson for 3 days
Description:
I'm afraid to touch the thing (No mention of the test in process listing). Asking nigel how to kill the test.
It looks like the old problem where test was over but we'd hang on shutdown.... as though TTI is no longer doing the shutdown in the ordained sequence.
