Summary:
Standalone HBase-0.92.1 fails to start master when coexisting with Hadoop-1.0.1, unnecessarily trying connecting to namenode.
Description:
I want to run a standalone HBase instance for development test purpose, which requires no HDFS. It works well on my server. However, when I add a hadoop directory into my server, HBase seems to notice that change and try to connect to Hadoop's namenode. The failures of HBase's connecting to Hadoop NameNode cause MHBase fail to start.
I extracted HBase-0.92.1 to my home directory:
~/hbase -> ~/hbase-0.92.1
In configuration file ~/hbase/config/hbase-site.xml, I set HBase to standalone mode and specify the data directory it uses.
<configuration>
<property>
<name>hbase.rootdir</name>
<value>file:///home/jianwen/.hbase.data</value>
</property>
</configuration>
Then I start HBase service with start-hbase.sh, enter HBase shell. Tests go well.
But things change when I install Hadoop into the same server. Hadoop-1.0.1 lies in my home directory too.
~/hadoop -> ~/hadoop-1.0.1
In configuration file ~/hadoop/config/core-site.xml, I set Hadoop to run in a pseudo distributed environment and specify the data directory for HDFS.
<configuration>
<property>
<name>hadoop.tmp.dir</name>
<value>/home/jianwen/.hdfs.data</value>
<description>A base for other temporary directories.</description>
</property>
<property>
<name>fs.default.name</name>
<value>hdfs://localhost:9000</value>
</property>
</configuration>
Then I format namenode, start hadoop service, run some MapReduce test programs, such as Pi, grep, et al. Hadoop works on my pesudo distributed environment. Then I stop hadoop service.
Since I add hadoop in my home directory, HBase fails to start. HBase log shows that HBase tries to connect to Hadoop NameNode when starting up, then fails. That's ridiculous because HBase in standalone mode should have NOTHING about NameNode and HDFS.
In summary, there may be two problems:
Standalone HBase attempts to connect to Hadoop NameNode at starting up when hadoop directory is co-located in home.
Not stating in HBase's configuration files, HBase seems to implicitly search hadoop directory around it and read the configuration information, such as NameNode in file core-site.xml. This unclear behavior confuses me a lot.
Log for standalone HBase starting up:
