Summary:
[hbase] restructure how HBase lays out files in the file system
Description:
Currently HBase has a pretty flat directory structure. For example:
 /hbase/hregion_70236052/info
/hbase/hregion_70236052/info/info/4328260619704027575
/hbase/hregion_70236052/info/mapfiles/4328260619704027575
/hbase/hregion_70236052/info/mapfiles/4328260619704027575/data
/hbase/hregion_70236052/info/mapfiles/4328260619704027575/index
All the region directories are under the root directory, and with encoded region names, it is impossible to determine what table a region belongs to. This should be restructured to:
/root-directory/table-name/encoded-region-name/column-family/{info,mapfiles}
It will be necessary to provide a migration script from current trunk to the new structure.
