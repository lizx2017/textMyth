Summary:
RS holding META when restarted in a single node setup may hang infinitely without META assignment
Description:
This bug may be minor as it likely to happen in a single node setup.
I restarted the RS holding META. The master tried assigning META using MetaSSH. But tried this before the new RS came up.
So as not region plan is found
 if (plan == null) {
        LOG.warn("Unable to determine a plan to assign " + region);
        if (tomActivated){
          this.timeoutMonitor.setAllRegionServersOffline(true);
        } else {
          regionStates.updateRegionState(region, RegionState.State.FAILED_OPEN);
        }
        return;
      }
we just return without assigment. And this being the META the small cluster just hangs.
