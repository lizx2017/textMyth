Summary:
Append HBASE_CLASSPATH to end of Java classpath and use another env var for prefix
Description:
HBASE-9097 changed the behavior to prefix HBASE_CLASSPATH to end of Java classpath instead of appending it. This break existing behavior (read more on HBASE-9097).
We should revert to existing behavior and provide another way to prefix certain jars to the classpath.
