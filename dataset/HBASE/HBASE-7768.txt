Summary:
zkcluster in local mode not seeing configurations in hbase-{site|default}.xml
Description:
in case of local mode we are creating mini zk cluster with default constructor
      if (LocalHBaseCluster.isLocal(conf)) {
        final MiniZooKeeperCluster zooKeeperCluster =
          new MiniZooKeeperCluster();
  public MiniZooKeeperCluster() {
    this(new Configuration());
  }
which is not reading any configurations in hbase-site|default.xml
I think we can pass configuration object to MiniZooKeeperCluster
