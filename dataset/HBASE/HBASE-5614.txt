Summary:
createTableAsync gets blocked and it is not an asynchronous operation
Description:
I have created table A using HBaseAdmin.createTableAsync() with 2000 pre-split regions, the expectation was client RPC call does not get blocked and i had only used 5 minutes as RPC socket timeout value.
It appears from logs/code that clients gets blocked (honoring the hbase.rpc.timeout value), times out after 5 minutes, master nio channel gets closed (related to client which invoked the createAsyncTable operation), put region entries in inconsistent state in META, meaning info:server is marked as null and AssignmentManager gets null server value (which causes NPE) and causes to table creation fail, i could not succeed until changing the hbase.rpc.timeout value to 15 minutes and created tables one at a time (each table has more than 2K pre-split regions in it)
Please refer the logs.
