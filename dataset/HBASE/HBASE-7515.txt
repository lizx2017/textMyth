Summary:
Store.loadStoreFiles should close opened files if there's an exception
Description:
Related to HBASE-7513. If a RS is able to open a few store files in Store.loadStoreFiles but one of them fails like in 7513, the opened files won't be closed and file descriptors will remain in a CLOSED_WAIT state.
The situation we encountered is that over the weekend one region was bounced between >100 region servers and eventually they all started dying on "Too many open files".
