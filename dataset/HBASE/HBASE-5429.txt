Summary:
remove deprecated HCatStorageHandler
Description:
HCatStorageHandler was moved for the "storageHandler" package to "mapreduce". For some reason it wasn't move but copied. I need to remove this as well as the HCatStorageHandlerImpl which I believe is no longer used. There is one class which depends on this instead of the mapreduce one. I need to fix that as well.
