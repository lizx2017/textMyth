Summary:
TextSequence does not obey ISA Text semantics
Description:
Before HADOOP-2738, it was impossible to subclass Text and have it obey the ISA semantics because Text instances would directly access other instances private members. Now that this has been fixed, fix TextSequence so it really can be used wherever a Text can be used.
