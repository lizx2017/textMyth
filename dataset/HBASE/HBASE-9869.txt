Summary:
Optimize HConnectionManager#getCachedLocation
Description:
It javadoc says: "TODO: This method during writing consumes 15% of CPU doing lookup". This is still true, says Yourkit. With 0.96, we also spend more time in these methods. We retry more, and the AsyncProcess calls it in parallel.
I don't have the patch for this yet, but I will spend some time on it.
