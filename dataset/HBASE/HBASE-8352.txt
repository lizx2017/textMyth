Summary:
Rename '.snapshot' directory
Description:
Testing HBase Snapshot on top of Hadoop's Snapshot branch (http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/hadoop/common/branches/HDFS-2802/), we found that both features used '.snapshot' directory to store metadata.
HDFS (built from HDFS-2802 branch) doesn't allow paths with .snapshot as a component
From discussion on dev@hbase.apache.org, (see http://search-hadoop.com/m/kY6C3cXMs51), consensus was to rename '.snapshot' directory in HBase so that both features can co-exist smoothly.
