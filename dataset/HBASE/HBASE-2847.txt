Summary:
Put added after a delete is overshadowed if its timestamp is older than than that of the tombstone
Description:
If we delete a row and then at a later time add to the row a cell that has a timestamp that is older than the delete, the addition will not be seen; the tombstone will prevent the newer addition being returned.
IMO, this is non-intuitive. We should fix.
