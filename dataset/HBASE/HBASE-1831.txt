Summary:
Scanning API must be reworked to allow for fully functional Filters client-side
Description:
Right now, a client replays part of the Filter locally by calling filterRowKey() and filterAllRemaining() to determine whether it should continue to the next region.
A number of new filters rely on filterKeyValue() and other calls to alter state. It's also a false assumption that all rows/keys affecting a filter returning true for FAR will be seen client-side (what about those that failed the filter).
This issue is about dealing with Filters properly from the client-side.
