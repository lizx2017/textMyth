Summary:
HBase startup should be with MALLOC_MAX_ARENA set
Description:
I think we should do the same as what HADOOP-7154 has done in terms of starting up daemons with MALLOC_MAX_ARENA set. I recently noticed that there were RS crashes on RHEL6 due to memory (could be avoided by setting MALLOC_MAX_ARENA).
