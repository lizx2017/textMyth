Summary:
application/x-www-form-urlencoded is incorrectly handled in the REST interface
Description:
currently if application/x-www-form-urlencoded form data is posted to the REST interface it does not appear in the query map. Attached to this issue is a patch that fixes this and allows data posted with a form as application/x-www-form-urlencoded data to be read into the query map and used to complete the request.
I first noticed this while trying to create a scanner and I was unable to specify the start date/end date/columns if the query parameters were passed in as application/x-www-form-urlencoded.
