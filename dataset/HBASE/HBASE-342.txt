Summary:
Add 'package' target to contrib/build-contrib.xml
Description:
Currently, contribs each build a jar file that is deployed to the contrib directory when hadoop is packaged. Here is a listing:
ls build/hadoop-0.16.0-dev/contrib/
hadoop-0.16.0-dev-abacus-examples.jar
hadoop-0.16.0-dev-abacus.jar
hadoop-0.16.0-dev-datajoin-examples.jar hadoop-0.16.0-dev-datajoin.jar
hadoop-0.16.0-dev-hbase.jar
hadoop-0.16.0-dev-streaming.jar
This works when the contrib product is a jar only.
The hbase contrib needs to add scripts, configurations and its own jar dependencies. HADOOP-1648 proposed amending the general cluster CLASSPATH to add contrib jars (contrib dependencies would be added to lib/contrib). HADOOP-2196 was proposing that hbase scripts be installed into the bin directory beside the hadoop core scripts.
Discussion up on #hadoop IRC channel this morning came up w/ a solution that better keeps the separation between whats core and whats contrib. In synopsis, responsibility for the contrib packaging is passed down to contribs as a new target in build-contrib.xml. The default would build the jar as is done now only rather than package the jar under the contrib directory, instead, the contrib jar would be put into a subdirectory named for the contrib. So for hbase, instead of packaging the hbase jar at contrib/hadoop-X.X.X-hbase.jar, instead it would sit at contrib/hbase/hadoop-X.X.X-hbase.jar . Those contribs that comprise of more than just a jar product – e.g. hbase with its start/stop scripts, dependent libraries and configurations – on invocation of the 'package' target, would create a bin, lib, and conf directory inside contrib/hbase/.
