Summary:
Improve AssignmentManager.handleRegion so that it can process certain ZK state in the case of RS offline
Description:
Currently AssignmentManager.handleRegion skips processing of ZK event change if the RS is offline. It relies on TimeoutMonitor and ServerShutdownHandler to process RIT.
// Verify this is a known server
if (!serverManager.isServerOnline(sn) &&
!this.master.getServerName().equals(sn))
{ LOG.warn("Attempted to handle region transition for server but " + "server is not online: " + Bytes.toString(data.getRegionName())); return; }
For certain states like OPENED, OPENING, FAILED_OPEN, CLOSED, it can continue the progressing even if the RS is offline.
