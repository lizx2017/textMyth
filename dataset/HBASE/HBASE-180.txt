Summary:
[hbase] REST servlet does not properly base64 row keys and column names
Description:
At the moment, the REST servlet treats row keys and column names as though they are all printable, when in fact they can definitely be arbitrary binary strings. When returning these items, they should be base64 encoded like cell values are.
