Summary:
If split happens while regionserver is going down, we can stick open.
Description:
J-D found this one testing. He found that if a split comes in during shutdown of a regionserver, then the regionserver can stick open... and won't go down.
We fixed a similar problem in the past where if balancer cut in during shutdown and assigned a regionserver an region during shutdown, we'd open it and it'd cause us again to stick open. We fixed that by introducing the 'closing' state.
Fix for the issue j-d found is to do closing check when onlining daughters.
