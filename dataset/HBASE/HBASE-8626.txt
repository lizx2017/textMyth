Summary:
RowMutations fail when Delete and Put on same columnFamily/column/row
Description:
When RowMutations have a Delete followed by Put to same column family or columns or rows, only the Delete is happening while the Put is ignored so atomicity of RowMutations is broken for such cases.
Attached is a unit test where the following tests are failing:
testDeleteCFThenPutInSameCF: Delete a column family and then Put to same column family.
testDeleteColumnThenPutSameColumn: Delete a column and then Put to same column.
testDeleteRowThenPutSameRow: Delete a row and then Put to same row
