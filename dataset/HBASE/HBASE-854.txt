Summary:
hbase-841 broke build on hudson?
Description:
Jim, you want to take a look at it?
841 changed interfaces. Changed interfaces can make for odd issues like the hangs exhibited up on hudson (stuff is failing for me on my laptop since about the commit 841... timeouts. I don't have same issue on branch).
