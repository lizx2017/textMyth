Summary:
bin/hbase zkcli cannot take arguments anymore
Description:
It used to be possible to do stuff like
bin/hbase zkcli stat
And we have this kind of stuff in the standard hbase scripts.
This has been broken by HBASE-8766 (reverting is an easy way to fix, it's unlikely to be the right thing to do. Pinging Enis Soztutar)
