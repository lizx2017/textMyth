Summary:
HFile performance regression between 0.92 and 0.94
Description:
By HFilePerformanceEvaluation seems that 0.94 is slower then 0.92
Looking at the profiler for the Scan path, seems that most of the time, compared to 92, is spent in the metrics dictionary lookup. Elliott Clark pointed out the new per family/block metrics.
By commenting the metrics call in HFileReaderV2, the performance seems to get better, but maybe metrics is not the only problem.
