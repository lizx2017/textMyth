Summary:
[Webui] Bootstrap based webui compatibility for IE and also fix some page format issues.
Description:
HBASE-7425 brings bootstrap based webui to hbase. While trying on trunk version, Firefox works well, but IE 8/9 layout and style look strange due to compatibility issue. Add "<!DOCTYPE html ...>" at the beginning of all jamon html/jsp templates to fix it.
Seems HBase-2110 had a work to comment out the DOCTYPE for all .jsp to make the browser run the pages in Quirks mode (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quirks_mode) due to jetty issue at that time?
To support the compatibility of webui across browsers (IE/Firefox/Chrome, etc.), there are some guidelines for choosing rendering the page under standard mode or quirk mode:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quirks_mode
http://hsivonen.iki.fi/doctype/
According to document, "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/DTD/xhtml11.dtd">" has the most extensive compatibility even for HTML 5. According to my test, add this could make webui works in IE (standard mode), while Firefox could not work well with styles. Looks like if in Firefox, we still need the quirk mode (no DOCTYPE declaration).
So just adding conditional DOCTYPE declaration for IE,
<!--[if IE]>
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/DTD/xhtml11.dtd">
<![endif]-->
this could make webui works for both IE and Firefox, also for Chrome and other browsers.
