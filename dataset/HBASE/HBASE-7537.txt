Summary:
.regioninfo not created by createHRegion()
Description:
After HBASE-5683 we have no longer the .regioninfo written on disk during the table creation.
so, if we fail before adding entries to .META. we end up with regions on disk that has no information, and hbck is not able to recover this situation.
The .regioninfo is written in checkRegioninfoOnFilesystem() that was called by initialize(), during the table creation and region opening. With HBASE-5683 we skip the call to initialize(), in during the region creation, to avoid to initialize the memstore & co.
