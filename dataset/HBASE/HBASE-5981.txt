Summary:
Change the log level from FATAL to WARN when failed syncing or appending
Description:
LOG.fatal("Could not append. Requesting close of hlog", e);
LOG.fatal("Could not sync. Requesting close of hlog", e);
Since we don't abort regionserver here, should we change the log level from FATAL to WARN?
