Summary:
LogRoller not added as a WAL listener when replication is enabled
Description:
Another thing I broke when porting to the new master, LogRoller is started but never added to HLog meaning that only hourly rolls work. Easy fix in HRS:
     this.hlogRoller = new LogRoller(this, this);
     listeners.add(this.hlogRoller);
     if (this.replicationHandler != null) {
-      listeners = new ArrayList<WALObserver>();
       // Replication handler is an implementation of WALActionsListener.
       listeners.add(this.replicationHandler);
