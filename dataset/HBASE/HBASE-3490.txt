Summary:
BatchUpdate Not available in the Hbase-0.89
Description:
I am trying to run the Map Reduce job to upload the text file into the Hbase-0.89 from the HDFS file system by using the Sample code in the Hbase-0.20.6 API document. But it seems, BatchUpdate has been completely removed. Does any one have the sample code to upload the Bulk of data into Hbase using Map reduce Program.
Thanks in advance
