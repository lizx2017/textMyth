Summary:
Timestamp-anchored scanning fails to find all records
Description:
If I add 3 versions of a cell and then scan across the first set of added cells using a timestamp that should only get values from the first upload, a bunch are missing (I added 100k on each of the three uploads). I thought it the fact that we set the number of cells found back to 1 in HStore when we move off current row/column but that doesn't seem to be it. I also tried upping the MAX_VERSIONs on my table and that seemed to have no effect. Need to look closer.
Build a unit test because replicating on cluster takes too much time.
