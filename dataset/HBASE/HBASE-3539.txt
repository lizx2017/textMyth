Summary:
Improve shell help to reflect all possible options
Description:
The shell is not consistent in its help texts. For example:
Scan a table; pass table name and optionally a dictionary of scanner
specifications.  Scanner specifications may include one or more of
the following: LIMIT, STARTROW, STOPROW, TIMESTAMP, or COLUMNS.  If
no columns are specified, all columns will be scanned.
but in the code you have
 filter = args["FILTER"]
 startrow = args["STARTROW"] || ''
 stoprow = args["STOPROW"]
 timestamp = args["TIMESTAMP"]
 columns = args["COLUMNS"] || args["COLUMN"] || get_all_columns
 cache = args["CACHE_BLOCKS"] || true
 versions = args["VERSIONS"] || 1
VERSIONS is missing from the help.
Check all commands and make sure all options are stated and examples given.
