Summary:
Opening a table also opens the metatable and never closes it.
Description:
Having upgraded to CDH3U3 version of hbase we found we had a zookeeper connection leak, tracking it down we found that closing the connection will only close the zookeeper connection if all calls to get the connection have been closed, there is incCount and decCount in the HConnection class,
When a table is opened it makes a call to the metascanner class which opens a connection to the meta table, this table never gets closed.
This caused the count in the HConnection class to never return to zero meaning that the zookeeper connection will not close when we close all the tables or calling
HConnectionManager.deleteConnection(config, true);
