Summary:
Compaction property at the server level are not propagated at the table level.
Description:
In case you do not override compaction parameter on the table/cf level, the values returned by the table descriptor will not reflect the value configured in the cluster.
For example - let assume you disabled major compaction by setting "hbase.hregion.majorcompaction" in the config to "0", prior starting the cluster. Let also assume that you have a table that in which you didn't set at all this parameter.
Then invoking
HTableDescriptor hTableDescriptor = conn.getHTableDescriptor(Bytes.toBytes("my table"));
hTableDescriptor.getValue("hbase.hregion.majorcompaction")
should return the cluster property (currently returns the default, ignoring the cluster prop.)
