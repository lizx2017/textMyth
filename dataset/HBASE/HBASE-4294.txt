Summary:
HLogSplitter sleeps with 1-second granularity
Description:
The HLogSplitter writer threads wait in 1-second intervals for data. When data arrives, notify() is called and they wake up. But when the main thread needs to notify the writers to shut down, it doesn't notify. Hence, the writers always wait up to a full extra second for each log split.
