Summary:
stop-hbase.sh clean up: backup master
Description:
In stop-hbase.sh:
  # TODO: store backup masters in ZooKeeper and have the primary send them a shutdown message
  # stop any backup masters
  "$bin"/hbase-daemons.sh --config "${HBASE_CONF_DIR}" \
    --hosts "${HBASE_BACKUP_MASTERS}" stop master-backup
After HBASE-5213, stop-hbase.sh -> hbase master stop will bring down the backup master too via the cluster status znode.
We should not need the above code anymore.
Another issue happens when the current master died and the backup master became the active master.
nohup nice -n ${HBASE_NICENESS:-0} "$HBASE_HOME"/bin/hbase \
   --config "${HBASE_CONF_DIR}" \
   master stop "$@" > "$logout" 2>&1 < /dev/null &

waitForProcessEnd `cat $pid` 'stop-master-command'
We can still issue 'hbase-stop.sh' from the old master.
stop-hbase.sh -> hbase master stop -> look for active master -> request shutdown
This process still works.
But the waitForProcessEnd statement will not work since the local master pid is not relevant anymore.
What is the best way in the this case?
