Summary:
StoreScanner not being closed?
Description:
In StoreScanner::next(List<KeyValue> outResult, int limit)
case SEEK_NEXT_ROW:
// This is just a relatively simple end of scan fix, to short-cut end us if there is a
// endKey in the scan.
if (!matcher.moreRowsMayExistAfter(kv))
{ outResult.addAll(results); return false; }
close() is not being called before returning false. In all other cases close is called before returning false. May be this is a problem.
