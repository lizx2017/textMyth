Summary:
--presplit option creates a first split with rowkey-end=0
Description:
HBASE-4440 adds a 'presplit' option to PerformanceEvaluation utility.
when the splits are generated, the first split has row-end-key=0 (zero). Hence this split doesn't get any data.
For example,
if total keyspace is 100, and splits requested are 5,
generated splits => [0, 20, 40, 60, 80]
it should be => [20, 40, 60, 80, 100]
