Summary:
Setting CACHE_BLOCKS to false in an hbase shell scan doesn't work
Description:
I was attempting to prevent blocks from being cached by setting CACHE_BLOCKS => false in the hbase shell when doing a scan but I kept seeing tons of evictions when I ran it. After inspecting "table.rb" I found this line:
cache = args["CACHE_BLOCKS"] || true
The problem then is that if CACHE_BLOCKS is false then this expression will always return true. Therefore, it's impossible to turn off block caching.
