Summary:
Region balancer not balancing
Description:
Despite regions being unbalanced, the load balancer takes no action. On my cluster the least-loaded regionserver has 33 regions and the most-loaded regionserver has 44 regions. My cluster has 1084 regions and 29 servers. It might be relevant that a 30th server used to belong to the cluster but was removed.
The master log has some strange entries when the balancer runs. The attached log file was generated by restarting the master, then running "balancer" in the shell.
