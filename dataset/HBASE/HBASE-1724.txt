Summary:
Data loss after `kill -9` region server
Description:
I have a 3 node cluster setup each running hadoop and hbase. I have created 'accounts' table and loaded some data into it (about 3000 rows).
Some days later one of the region servers died and after i restarted it there were no records in the table at all. I saw HLOG file with my records
in HDFS but as I understand the file was not used by HBase to recover the table.
I tried to emulate the situation and uploaded another 2000 records into my table and killed the region server holding 'accounts' table region.
In the HDFS I found file with my records but some time later it was replaced by another empty directory. As i suspected after killed region
server startup the data was not recovered.
Everything is lost again and there is no any exceptions in the logs...
