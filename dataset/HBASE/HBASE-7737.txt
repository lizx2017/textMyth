Summary:
[89-fb] Force to generate the hostAddress:port as stringValue in HServerAddress
Description:
There is a serious bug in HServerAddress, who depends on the stringValue [class variable] for comparison. This variable is supposed to be host_ip_address:port.
However, there is one constructor which allows user to pass a string as host_ip_address directly. This constructor is buggy because some caller may pass the host name instead of host ip address. And we found out one case in the HBase client.
The fix is to normalize the stringValue generation by calling the existing function getHostAddressWithPort.
For example:
this.stringValue = getHostAddressWithPort();
