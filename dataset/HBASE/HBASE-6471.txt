Summary:
Performance regression caused by HBASE-4054
Description:
The patch in HBASE-4054 switches the PooledHTable to extend HTable as opposed to implement HTableInterface.
Since HTable does not have an empty constructor, the patch added a call to the super() constructor, which though does trigger the ZooKeeper and META scan, causing a considerable delay.
With multiple threads using the pool in parallel, the first thread is holding up all the subsequent ones, in effect it negates the whole reason we have a HTable pool.
We should complete HBASE-5728, or alternatively add a protected, empty constructor the HTable. I am +1 for the former.
