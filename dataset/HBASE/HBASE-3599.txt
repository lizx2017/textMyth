Summary:
Result constructor assumes input is already sorted
Description:
The Result(List<KeyValue>) and Result(KeyValue[]) constructor assume that the input is already sorted (HBASE-3073, HBASE-2753). This works for normal use cases, but not for hand constructed Result objects (e.g. unit tests).
I encountered this when upgrading to 0.90 that some unit tests now failed due to this. One fix is to add some documentation on the constructors that says the input MUST be sorted. The other would be to explicitly sort the items (not so desirable).
