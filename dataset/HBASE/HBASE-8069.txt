Summary:
TestHLog is dependent on the execution order
Description:
Changing the execution order of the tests, TestHLog show up as failing
<runOrder>alphabetical</runOrder>
testAppendClose() changes the DFS cluster of the test (set globally) so the tests executed after has the new DFS. Trying to start a new mini cluster for every test @Before seems to solve the problem.
testSplit(org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.wal.TestHLog): 3 exceptions [org.apache.hadoop.ipc.RemoteException(org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.namenode.LeaseExpiredException): No lease on /user/th30z/hbase/TestHLog/21985ea121a1d65fa82d90d521be7313/recovered.edits/0000000000000000001.temp File is not open for writing. Holder DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1044150136_583 does not have any open files.
Looking at testSplit() the failure seems to be in logSplitter.splitLog(), OutputSink.finishWritingAndClose() is not able to close the files and rethrow the exception.
