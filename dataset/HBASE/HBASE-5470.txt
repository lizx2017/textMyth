Summary:
Make DataBlockEncodingTool work correctly with no native compression codecs loaded
Description:
DataBlockEncodingTool was fixed as part of porting data block encoding (HBASE-4218) to 89-fb (https://reviews.facebook.net/rHBASEEIGHTNINEFBBRANCH1245291, https://reviews.facebook.net/D1659). The bug appeared when using GZ as baseline compression codec but not loading native Hadoop libraries, in which case the compressor instance would be null. The purpose of this JIRA is to bring the trunk version of DataBlockEncodingTool to parity with the 89-fb version, and further improvements to the tool will be made separately.
