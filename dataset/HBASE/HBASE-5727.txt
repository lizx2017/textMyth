Summary:
secure hbase build broke because of 'HBASE-5451 Switch RPC call envelope/headers to PBs'
Description:
If you build with the security profile – i.e. add '-P security' on the command line – you'll see that the secure build is broke since we messed in rpc.
Assigning Deveraj to take a look. If you can't work on this now DD, just give it back to me and I'll have a go at it. Thanks.
