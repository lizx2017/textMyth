Summary:
HRegion.get never validates row
Description:
If a client gets confused (possibly by a hole in .META., see HBASE-4333), it may send a request to the wrong region. Paths through put, delete, incrementColumnValue, and checkAndMutate all call checkRow either directly or indirectly (through getLock). But get apparently does not. This can result in returning an incorrect empty result instead of a WrongRegionException.
