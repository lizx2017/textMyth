Summary:
[rest/stargate] URI decoding in RowResource
Description:
Currently the RowResource constructor URI-decodes the rowspec string before passing it to the RowSpec constructor, which breaks rowspecs whose row, column etc identifiers contain slashes.
When addressing a row and/or column whose identifier contains a slash, the client must URI-encode the values, so for example a row whose identifier is 'http://hbase.apache.org/' would be addressed as:
/tablename/http%3a%2f%2fhbase.apache.org%2f/column:qualifier
Currently RowResource() decodes this before passing to RowSpec(), so RowSpec() recieves:
/tablename/http://hbase.apache.org//column:qualifier
which cannot be correctly parsed because of the extra slashes.
RowResource() should pass the string on to RowSpec() undecoded, and RowSpec() should decode the components individually after piecing apart the path.
