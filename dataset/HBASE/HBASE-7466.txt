Summary:
Fix junit dependency typo in 0.94
Description:
Its specified as
<type>test,runtime</type>
but maven only takes one type parameter. This is the cause for the message
[WARNING] Some problems were encountered while building the effective model for org.apache.hbase:hbase:jar:0.94.4
[WARNING] 'dependencies.dependency.scope' for junit:junit:jar must be one of [provided, compile, runtime, test, system] but is 'test,runtime'. @ line 1327, column 14
Interestingly, the build still works, but we should still cleanup this warning.
