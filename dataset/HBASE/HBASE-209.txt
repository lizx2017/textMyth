Summary:
[hbase] HLog generates incorrect file name when splitting a log, race condition also contributes
Description:
In Hadoop-Nightly #277 TestRegionServerExit failed with a timeout.
The reason for this was a race in the Master in which checkAssigned (run from either the root or meta scanner) will immediately try to split the log and then assign a region which has invalid server info.
The scenario went something like this:
1. region server aborted
2. root region was written on optional cache flush
lease timed out on aborted server which removes it from serversToServerInfo and queues a PendingServerShutdown operation
3. root scanner runs and finds server info incorrect (it is in the root region but the server is not in serversToServerInfo
4. checkAssigned starts splitting the log but because the log name is incorrect it can't finish
5. PendingServerShutdown fires and really gums up the works.
So there are two problems:
1. HLog.splitLog needs to generate the correct log file name.
2. PendingServerShutdown and/or leaseExpired need to cooperate with checkAssigned so that there are not two concurrent attempts to recover the log.
