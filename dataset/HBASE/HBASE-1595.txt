Summary:
hadoop-default.xml and zoo.cfg in hbase jar
Description:
A while back I'd added zoo.cfg to the hbase jar. I added it at top-level. Turns out that was wrong location. It couldn't be found unless it was in a conf subdir. Fellas trying to build unit tests that depended on hbase were getting this:
21:31 < cwensel> adding zoo.cfg to cp gets me this: junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: Forked Java VM exited abnormally. Please note the time in the report does not reflect the time until the VM exit.
So, I moved zoo.cfg down into conf but also moved hbase-default.xml there. The latter was a mistake. It should stay at top level. In its new location, fellas were getting NPEs out of ZK Quorum Main.
