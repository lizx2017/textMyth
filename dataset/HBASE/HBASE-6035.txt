Summary:
[0.89-fb] region_status.rb does not count total regions correctly, when favornodes are used
Description:
bin/hbase-jruby region_status.rb prints some weired numbers
1047/2 .. the denominator is 2, which should have been the total number of regions in the region.
It turns out that this was because we were using both:
scan.setFilter(FirstKeyOnlyFilter.new)
and
scan.addColumn INFO, REGION_INFO
it worked fine when there was no column before info:regioninfo.
But, after adding info:favourednodes we were no longer getting info:regioninfo.
Removing the scan.setFilter fixes the problem.
