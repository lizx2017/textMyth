Summary:
Refactor "Corrupt Data" Tests in TestHLogSplit
Description:
While fixing HBASE-2643, I noticed that a couple of the HLogSplit tests from HBASE-2437 were now failing. 3 tests are trying to detect proper handling of garbage data: testCorruptedFileGetsArchivedIfSkipErrors, testTrailingGarbageCorruptionLogFileSkipErrorsFalseThrows, testCorruptedLogFilesSkipErrorsFalseDoesNotTouchLogs. However, these tests are corrupting data at the HBase level. Data corruption should be tested at the HDFS level, because the filesystem is responsible for data validation. These tests need to inject corrupt data at the HDFS level & then verify that ChecksumExceptions are thrown.
