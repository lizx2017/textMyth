Summary:
Adopt TestLoadAndVerify from BigTop
Description:
We have found BigTop's TestLoadAndVerify quite useful for testing, and I propose we adopt it in the HBase code base.
https://github.com/apache/bigtop/blob/master/bigtop-tests/test-artifacts/hbase/src/main/groovy/org/apache/bigtop/itest/hbase/system/TestLoadAndVerify.java
There was some discussions previously, of whether HBase or BigTop should host system tests specific to HBase, and I believe for this specific one, it belongs to the HBase code path.
We can maintain the code, and release it as a part of HBase, so that testing it against secure deployments, Hadoop2, etc is easier (BIGTOP-853 fixes the test to work with secure cluster)
