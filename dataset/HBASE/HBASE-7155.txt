Summary:
Excessive usage of InterruptedException where it can't be thrown
Description:
RootRegionTracker.getRootRegionLocation() declares that it can throw an InterruptedException, but it can't. This exception is rethrown by many other functions reaching the HBaseAdmin API.
If we remove the throws statement from the HBaseAdmin API libraries already compiled will work fine, but if the user is trying to catch an InterruptedException around one of those methods the compiler will complain.
Should we clean this up?
