Summary:
[hbase] Fix to HScanner to Support Filters, Add Filter Tests to TestScanner2
Description:
HScanner has a non-functional support for filters. Upon writing scanner tests for filters in TestScanner2, I discovered that HScanner only increments each of its sub-scanners when the filtering decision is false. Until now this has not been a problem, because none of the other processes that use HScanner also use filters. The patch to be posted will fix the HScanner incrementation problem, and add testing for filters to TestScanner2.
