Summary:
-ROOT- reassignment provokes .META. reassignment though .META. is sitting pretty
Description:
I've seen post-hbase-1457 that if regionserver hosting ROOT goes down and then is reassigned, though .META. is happy where it is, and even though ROOT edits get picked up and are applied, I see that rootscanner complains the .META. assignment is invalid because the server and startcode are empty. Something's up. Take a look.
