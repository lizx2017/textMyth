Summary:
HTable.delete triggers pre/postScannerOpen upcalls of RegionObserver
Description:
Currently RegionObserver pre/postScannerOpen() upcalls are injected at HRegion.instantiateInternalScanner(). If someone uses scanner methods at HRegion, ScannerOpen upcalls can be triggered unexpectedly. HBase-3583 pulled scannerNext and scannerClose from HRegion to HRegionServer. We also need to pull scannerOpen to HRegionObserver to prevent unexpected triggers.
