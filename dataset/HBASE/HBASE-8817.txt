Summary:
Enhance The Apache HBase Reference Guide
Description:
I am reading the guide here: http://hbase.apache.org/book.html#regions.arch
I have noticed the following:
There is lack of coverage on scan. Note that Lars has a very good presentation from last year's HBaseCon: http://www.slideshare.net/cloudera/3-learning-h-base-internals-lars-hofhansl-salesforce-final
Under section 9.7.6.1, there is no mentioning of flush per region if a memstore reached the size threshold (and a possible flush of all memstores if over all memory usage of all the memstores reached memstore.upperlimit). Note that people need to combine the information provided in section 9 with section 2.3.1.1 to fully understand the situation.
Compaction tuning strategies. Both Nicolas from Facebook and Sergey from Hortonworks have presented various compaction algorithms. Sometime, once all the necessary code is in master, we need to have the coverage.
Let me know how I can help on the matter.
