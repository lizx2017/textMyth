Summary:
In master when handling a split, the offline of parent and online of children is not done atomically
Description:
In AssignmentManager.handleSplitReport() we do:
    regionOffline(parent);
    regionOnline(a, hsi);
    regionOnline(b, hsi);
Within each of these, there is locking, but there is no locking around this entire operation. There should be.
This might be the cause of HBASE-3278
