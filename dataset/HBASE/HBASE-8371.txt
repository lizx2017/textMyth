Summary:
[89-fb] Remove the thrift dependency in RegionException
Description:
RegionException was derived from IOError to capture the backoff timeout,
information required by the thrift clients to reduce the load on the
overloaded region servers. The exception was derived from IOError to
make it compatible with thrift. When this change was ported to neptune,
it created a new dependency on the thrift package.
