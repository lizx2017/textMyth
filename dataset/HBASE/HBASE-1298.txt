Summary:
master.jsp & table.jsp do not URI Encode table or region names in links
Description:
"UAZAAAAAZNaGnEKI+gC" is a key in my "userdata" table which happens to be the start key for a region named "userdata,UAZAAAAAZNaGnEKI+gC,1238170268268"
"/table.jsp?name=userdata" lists a link to "/regionhistorian.jsp?regionname=userdata,UAZAAAAAZNaGnEKI+gC,1238170268268" which is incorrect because the " + " character is not properly URI Encoded. This results in a misleading user error message: "This region is no longer available. It may be due to a split, a merge or the name changed. " manually escaping the " + " character as "%2B" produces the correct output.
A quick skim of master.jsp suggests it has a similar problem: it doesn't URI Encode table names when constructing links to table.jsp
