Summary:
hbase-daemons.sh cannot be used do launch zookeeper independently from HBase
Description:
The HBaseBook says in chapter 2.5.1
If you would like to run ZooKeeper yourself, independent of HBase start/stop, you would do the following

${HBASE_HOME}/bin/hbase-daemons.sh {start,stop} zookeeper

Note that you can use HBase in this manner to spin up a ZooKeeper cluster, unrelated to HBase. Just make sure to set HBASE_MANAGES_ZK to false if you want it to stay up across HBase restarts so that when HBase shuts down, it doesn't take ZooKeeper down with it.
However, it does not work because the hbase-daemons script always calls zookeepers.sh which checks HBASE_MANAGES_ZK and does nothing when it's not set to true.
Imho, the best solution would be to keep the documentation and change the scripts.
