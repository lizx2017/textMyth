Summary:
ipc.HBaseClient should support address change as does hdfs
Description:
ipc.HBaseClient is a copy paste from ipc.Client. This implementation now support adress change.
As a side node, HBase comment on 'the max number of retries is 45' is now wrong.

catch (IOException ie)
{ handleConnectionFailure(ioFailures++, maxRetries, ie); }
— Hadoop Client
