Summary:
[replication] Race in ReplicationSourceManager.init can initiate a failover even if the node is alive
Description:
Yet another bug found during the leap second madness, it's possible to miss the registration of new region servers so that in ReplicationSourceManager.init we start the failover of a live and replicating region server. I don't think there's data loss but the RS that's being failed over will die on:

It seems to me that just refreshing otherRegionServers after getting the list of currentReplicators would be enough to fix this.
