Summary:
Remove thrift2 from 0.95 and trunk
Description:
thrift2 is what our thrift interface should be. It is unfinished though and without an owner. While in place, it prompts why a thrift2 and a thrift1 questions. Meantime, thrift1 is what folks use and it is getting bug fixes. Suggest we remove thrift2 till it gets carried beyond thrift1.
