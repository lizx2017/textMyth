Summary:
When HBase gets executed against Hadoop 2.X "SLF4j:CLASSPATH contains multiple SLF4j binding" warning is displayed
Description:
Since HBase tries to find locations of the Hadoop jars from the environment in certain cases it ends up with extra SLF4j jars coming from Hadoop classpath. When that happens "SLF4j:CLASSPATH contains multiple SLF4j binding" warning gets displayed.
The good news here is that the warning is just that â€“ a warning. The bad news is that it seems this issue will be tricky to fix properly. On one hand we would like Hadoop itself to give us transitive closure of the set of jar files required (computing that in the HBase script is a maintenance nightmare). On the other hand that set of jar files could contain some of the very same jars shipped with HBase.
This problem existed for quiet some time. SLF4j is just the first component to complain.
