Summary:
[hbase] TestCleanRegionServerExit hung on hudson
Description:
Watching hudson, I happened to catch a hung TestCleanRegionServerExit. The test had done a join onto the server it'd asked shutdown only the server wasn't going down because it was stuck trying to get a memcache write lock so it could finish the last flush on regions before close. Somehow, a read (or write) lock is not being cleaned up. Scanners are the suspect but looking at the code, scanners should be getting closed on expiration of their lease.
