Summary:
Fix the .META. fixer in HBaseFsck
Description:
I tried writing a few unit tests in the scope of HBASE-3216 since the previous one was only testing a best case scenario but it's at least currently not able to fix the case where .META. says the assignment is on server A when in fact it's on server B (the region gets closed but never reopened).
Stack says the breakage probably happened with the new master.
