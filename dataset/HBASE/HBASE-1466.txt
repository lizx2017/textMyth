Summary:
Binary keys are not first class citizens
Description:
If you use binary keys, you don't get full features as if you were not using binary keys. Some things that are broken:
grep/less cant search in logfiles with binary data
displays are unreadable due to weird utf8/other issues
can't use the region historian
etc
