Summary:
Client needs to reconnect if it expires its zk session
Description:
Clients use an HConnection down in their guts to connect to the hbase cluster. Master-is-running and root-region-location are up in zk. Setup of a new HConnection sets up a connection to ZooKeeper. If the session with ZK expires for whatever reason â€“ in tests they would expire because zk ensemble was restarted across tests or we might expire because of a long GC, well, it'll be frustrating to users if we do not just try and resetup the zk connection.
