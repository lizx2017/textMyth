Summary:
Daughters deployed to parents regionserver node, always
Description:
Ryan apparently said this 6 months ago, that on split, the regions are assigned back to the parent hosting regionserver almost always. Then, to keep up some kinda balance, the load balancer kicks and closes the just opened daughters – which have just been opened a moment ago – to deploy them elsewhere in the name of keeping good balance.
This issue is to confirm the above behavior indeed happens and then to take action to make it so at least one of the daughters is held up so it doesn't go back to the current heartbeating host, the parent hosting server.
