Summary:
Wrongly delete cells in some case which can not be deleted
Description:
First, I put a cell using put interface, but I don't specify timestamp. Then I delete the the same row, specify a timestamp of 1L. Unfortunately, the former cell is
deleted. We should know this cell can not be deleted in this case. (Using original Client API)
Code like this;
public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception
{ Cluster cluster = new Cluster(); cluster.add("10.28.171.38", 8080); Client client = new Client(cluster); RemoteHTable table = new RemoteHTable(client, "demotime"); Put put = new Put(Bytes.toBytes("row21")); put.add("info".getBytes(), "name".getBytes(), "huanggang".getBytes()); table.put(put); Delete delete = new Delete(Bytes.toBytes("row21")); delete.setTimestamp(1L); table.delete(delete); }
