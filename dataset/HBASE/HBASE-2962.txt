Summary:
Add missing methods to HTableInterface (and HTable)
Description:
HBASE-1845 added two new methods in HTable (batch). Those need to be in HTableInterface as well.
And in HTable we have:
put(Put)
put(List<Put>)
delete(Delete)
delete(List<Delete>)
get(Get)
Shouldn't we add a get(List<Get>) as well for consistency?
Others that are missing:
getRegionLocation
getScannerCaching / setgetScannerCaching
getStartKeys / getEndKeys / getStartEndKeys
getRegionsInfo
setAutoFlush
getWriteBufferSize / setWriteBufferSize
getWriteBuffer
prewarmRegionCache
serializeRegionInfo / deserializeRegionInfo
For some of those it might not make sense to add them. I'm just listing them all.
The patch is trivial once we've decided which to add, I'll prepare one for batch & get.
