Summary:
UnknownRegionException blocks hbck from sideline big overlap regions
Description:
Before sidelining a big overlap region, hbck tries to close it and offline it at first. However, sometimes, it throws NotServingRegion or UnknownRegionException.
It could be because the region is not open/assigned at all, or some other issue.
We should figure out why and fix it.
By the way, it's better to print out in the log the command line to bulk load back sidelined regions, if any.
