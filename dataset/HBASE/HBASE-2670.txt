Summary:
MemStore should retain multiple KVs with the same timestamp when memstoreTS differs
Description:
There appears to be a bug in HBASE-2248 as committed to trunk. See following failing test:
http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/HBase-TRUNK/1296/testReport/junit/org.apache.hadoop.hbase/TestAcidGuarantees/testAtomicity/
Think this is the same bug we saw early on in 2248 in the 0.20 branch, looks like the fix didn't make it over.
