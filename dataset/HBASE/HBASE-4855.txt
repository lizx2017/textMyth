Summary:
SplitLogManager hangs on cluster restart due to batch.installed doubly counted
Description:
Start a master and RS
RS goes down (kill -9)
Wait for ServerShutDownHandler to create the splitlog nodes. As no RS is there it cannot be processed.
Restart both master and bring up an RS.
The master hangs in SplitLogManager.waitforTasks().
I feel that batch.done is not getting incremented properly. Not yet digged in fully.
This may be the reason for occasional failure of TestDistributedLogSplitting.testWorkerAbort().
