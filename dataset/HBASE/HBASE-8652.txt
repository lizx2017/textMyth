Summary:
Number of compacting KVs is not reset at the end of compaction
Description:
Looking at master:60010/master-status#compactStas , I noticed that 'Num. Compacting KVs' column stays unchanged at non-zero value(s).
In DefaultCompactor#compact(), we have this at the beginning:
    this.progress = new CompactionProgress(fd.maxKeyCount);
But progress.totalCompactingKVs is not reset at the end of compact().
