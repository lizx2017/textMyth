Summary:
Kill -STOP of RS hosting META does not recover
Description:
If you find the server hosting META and kill -STOP its region server, it will eventually lose its ZK session and the master will split its logs and try to reassign. However, at some point along here it tries to access the old META, and gets SocketTimeoutExceptions, which cause it to keep retrying forever. Once I kill -9ed the stopped server, things came back to life.
