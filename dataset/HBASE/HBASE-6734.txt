Summary:
Code duplication in LoadIncrementalHFiles
Description:
This was due to the merge of two Jiras:
      if (queue.isEmpty()) {
        LOG.warn("Bulk load operation did not find any files to load in " +
            "directory " + hfofDir.toUri() + ".  Does it contain files in " +
            "subdirectories that correspond to column family names?");
        return;
      }

      if (queue.isEmpty()) {
        LOG.warn("Bulk load operation did not find any files to load in " +
        "directory " + hfofDir.toUri() + ".  Does it contain files in " +
        "subdirectories that correspond to column family names?");
      }
