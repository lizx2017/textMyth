Summary:
Not all public methods have complete (or correct) javadoc
Description:
In http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/Hbase/HowToContribute it clearly states:
 o All public classes and methods should have informative Javadoc comments. 
(it should probably read "correct and informative")
I have seen missing input parameters and return values. Paying attention to details like this will also lessen the number of questions seen on the hbase-user mailing list.
