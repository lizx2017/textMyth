Summary:
TestSizeBasedThrottler fails occasionally
Description:
Every now and then TestSizeBasedThrottler fails reaching the test internal timeouts.
I think the timeouts (200ms) are too short for the Jenkins machines.
On my (reasonably fast) machine I get timeout reliably when I set the timeout to 50ms, and occasionally at 100ms.
Let's double the timeout from 200ms to 400ms.
