Summary:
Lower StochasticLoadBalancer's default max run time
Description:
Three things about the 1 minute it takes to decide if we want to balance or not:
1 minute is also the default socket timeout, so if you call "balancer" in the shell you often get a SocketTimeoutException back. Bad user experience.
Elliott was telling me that we might not even need 1 minute to compute a good balance anyways because of other improvements. I tested 30 seconds on a badly balanced cluster and it worked well.
I personally think that 1 minute is too much time (Elliott disagrees).
