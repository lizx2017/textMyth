Summary:
enable SSH before assign META on Master startup
Description:
I think HBASE-5918 could not fix this issue. In HMaster#assignRootAndMeta:
1. Assign ROOT.
2. Block until ROOT be opened.
3. Assign META.
4. Block until META be opened.
SSH is enabled after step 4. So if the RS who host ROOT dies before step 4, master will be blocked.
