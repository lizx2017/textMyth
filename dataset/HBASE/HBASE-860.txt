Summary:
IndexTableReduce doesnt write the column name as the lucene index field properly.
Description:
Instead of using the table column name as the field in the lucene index, the byte array jvm object id is written to the lucene index. i.e. [B@234DE3 instead of "myColFamily:myCol"
In the class IndexTableReduce, essentially one line of code needs to be changed as far as i can see to fix this issue. I will be submitting a patch here within the hour.
