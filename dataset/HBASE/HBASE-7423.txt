Summary:
HFileArchiver should not use the configuration from the Filesystem
Description:
HFileArchiver gets the configuration from the FileSystem in
 public static void archiveRegion(FileSystem fs, HRegionInfo info)
      throws IOException {
    Path rootDir = FSUtils.getRootDir(fs.getConf());
In Pig's test cases, they construct a MiniDFSCluster and pass it to HBaseTestingUtil, which causes the delete table to fail because it will refer to the FileSystem's configuration rather than HBase's one.
