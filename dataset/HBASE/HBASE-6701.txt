Summary:
Revisit thrust of paragraph on splitting
Description:
See the thread 'md5 hash key and splits' for the confusion our paragraph on splitting seems to bring on (as well as good input on when manual splitting might be favored). The user is under the impression that he needs to manually split though his keys have md5 salt. The paragraph needs to make sure it does not bring on such confusion as it would seem to in this case.
