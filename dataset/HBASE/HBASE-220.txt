Summary:
Copy Constructor HBaseConfiguration(Configuration) will override hbase configurations if argumant is not an instance of HBaseConfiguration.
Description:
Copy Constructor HBaseConfiguration(Configuration) will override hbase
settings from the argument if the arg is not an instance of HBaseConfiguration.
This was happening to me when I was passing around hbase settings as
part of a Table Map/Reduce job configuration.
Observer the following unexpected behavior:
JobConf jobConf = new JobConf("job.xml");
HBaseConfiguration hbaseConf = new HBaseConfiguration(jobConf);
String result1 = jobConf.get("hbase.master"); // Value from job.xml loaded by tasktracker
String result2 = hbaseConf.get("hbase.master"); // Value from hbase-site.xml
Assert.assertEquals(result1, result2); // Fail
In particular, this copy constructor is called in hbase.mapred.TableInputFormat.configure(JobConf).
I have a hbase.master defined in my JobConf that gets overridden in the HbaseConfiguration by hbase-site.xml.
Should the Constructor instead add new hbase-specific values if they are not already defined in the Configuration parameter?
