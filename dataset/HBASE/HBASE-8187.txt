Summary:
trunk/0.95 tarball packaging
Description:
Packaging needs work now we have maven multi-moduled. Sounds like folks want a package for hadoop1 and hadoop2. Also want source package and maybe even a package that includes test jars so can run integration tests.
Let this be umbrella issue for package fixes. Will hang smaller issues off this one as we figure them.
