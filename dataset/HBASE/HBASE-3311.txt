Summary:
Addendum patch on HBASE-3298 broke buid
Description:
Our addendum patch on HBASE-3298 removed reassign if an unassign failed; it makes no sense doing an assign on failed unassign – it makes for double-assign (at least, reasoning through the possible failures, i can't find case where we'd want to assign on failed unassign). Well, TestMasterFailover depended on this behavior. Its the test that exercises all of this zk stuff. It tries its best to manufacture messy scenarios. One scenario adds a PENDING_CLOSE but it doesn't have an associated server. A null server was returning a 'false' when we tried to do the close rpc which would fall into the since removed reassign code – which would pick up a server, and the test would go on to succeed.
Removing reassign on unassign broke this.
