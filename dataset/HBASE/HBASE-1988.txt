Summary:
OutOfMemoryError in RegionServer
Description:
RegionServers tend to die with an OutOfMemoryError under load. I expected this problem to go away with the fix for HBASE-1927 in 0.20.2 RC1, but it's still happening. Also, when this happens the cluster becomes unresponsive, even once the load on the machines has gone back down. Interestingly there are lots and lots of scanner lease expired messages right before the OOM.
