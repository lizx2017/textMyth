Summary:
TableServers's cachedRegionLocation doesn't have size limit.
Description:
cachedRegionLocation stores region locations of tables whenever new region is looked up. However, the enties are deleted only when TableServers object is closed or locateRegion is called with false useCache argument. Therefore, it seems to grow without limit and cause out of memory exception.
