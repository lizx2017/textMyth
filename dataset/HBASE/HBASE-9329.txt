Description:
2013-08-23 17:57:24,277 WARN org.apache.hadoop.hbase.master.snapshot.SnapshotManager: Couldn't delete working snapshot directory: hdfs://node3:9000/hbase/.hbase-snapshot/.tmp
I don't have any .hbase-snapshot directory, so there is no need to try to delete the .tmp directory into it. Might first need to check if this directory exist.
