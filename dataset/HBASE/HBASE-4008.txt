Summary:
Problem while stopping HBase
Description:
stop-hbase.sh stops the server successfully if and only if the server is instantiated properly.
When u Run
start-hbase.sh; sleep 10; stop-hbase.sh; ( This works totally fine and has no issues )
Whereas when u run
start-hbase.sh; stop-hbase.sh; ( This never stops the server and neither the server gets initialized and starts properly )
