Summary:
Update Rolling Restart documentation
Description:
Rolling Restart documentation specifies that we need to stop the balancer before proceeding. However, bin/graceful_stop.sh is already taking care of that:
echo "Disabling balancer!"
echo 'balance_switch false' | "$bin"/hbase --config ${HBASE_CONF_DIR} shell
So documentation need to be updated to remove this recommandation.
