Summary:
stop using code mapping for method names in the RPC
Description:
since we use a sorted mapping of method names -> codes and send that over the wire, even trivial changes, such as adding a new call, become wire-incompatible. This means many features which could easily have gone into a minor update must wait for a major update. Eg: 2066, 1845, etc.
This will increase on-wire overhead, but the compatibility is worth it I think.
