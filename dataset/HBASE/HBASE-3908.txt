Summary:
TableSplit not implementing "hashCode" problem
Description:
reported by Lucian Iordache on hbase-user mail list. will attach the patch asap
-------------------------------------------
Hi guys,
I've just found a problem with the class TableSplit. It implements "equals",
but it does not implement hashCode also, as it should have.
I've discovered it by trying to use a HashSet of TableSplit's, and I've
noticed that some duplicate splits are added to the set.
The only option I have for now is to extend TableSplit and to use the
subclass.
I use cloudera hbase cdh3u0 version.
Do you know about this problem? Should I open a Jira issue for that, or it
already exists?
Thanks,
Lucian
