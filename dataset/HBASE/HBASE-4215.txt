Summary:
RS requestsPerSecond counter seems to be off
Description:
In testing trunk, I had YCSB reporting some 40,000 requests/second, but the summary info on the master webpage was consistently indicating somewhere around 3x that. I'm guessing that we may have a bug where we forgot to divide by time.
