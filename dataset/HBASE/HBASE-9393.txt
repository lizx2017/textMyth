Summary:
Region Server fails to properly close socket resulting in many CLOSE_WAIT to Data Nodes
Description:
HBase dose not close a dead connection with the datanode.
This resulting in over 60K CLOSE_WAIT and at some point HBase can not connect to the datanode because too many mapped sockets from one host to another on the same port.
The example below is with low CLOSE_WAIT count because we had to restart hbase to solve the porblem, later in time it will incease to 60-100K sockets on CLOSE_WAIT
[root@hd2-region3 ~]# netstat -nap |grep CLOSE_WAIT |grep 21592 |wc -l
13156
[root@hd2-region3 ~]# ps -ef |grep 21592
