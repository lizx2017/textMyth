Summary:
[hbase] start command line option causes further command line options to be ignored in REST
Description:
If you run
/apps/hadoop/contrib/hbase/bin/hbase rest start --port=42274
then rather than running REST on port 42274, it ignores the --port directive and just starts REST on the default port. Detecting the start option should not ignore the rest of the command line.
