Summary:
HBaseAdmin.flush claims to be asynchronous but appears to be synchronous
Description:
Relevant comment:
   * Flush a table or an individual region.
   * Asynchronous operation.
but it looks like it's synchronous. In fact, it returns whether the flush ran or not:
message FlushRegionResponse {
  required uint64 lastFlushTime = 1;
  optional bool flushed = 2;
}
