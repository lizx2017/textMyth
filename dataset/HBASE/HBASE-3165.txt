Summary:
some performance things i did
Description:
in an attempt to improve the profile of the serialization of results in the regionserver side I did a large number of things to reduce buffer copies, improve the API usage efficiency (using the BB API directly) and so on.
Using a YCSB config like so:
recordcount=10000
#recordcount=5
operationcount=1000
workload=com.yahoo.ycsb.workloads.CoreWorkload
readallfields=true
readproportion=0
updateproportion=0
scanproportion=1
insertproportion=0
fieldlength=10
fieldcount=100
requestdistribution=zipfian
scanlength=300
scanlengthdistribution=zipfian
threadcount=1
columnfamily=data
Doing a medium sized scan of 1-300 rows.
Top line performance was at about 67ms, but these micro improvements didnt budge that needle, and it didnt change the scale of the CPU profiler - ie: cpu time spent in serialization was the same.
Since then I also made an improvement to HBase-YCSB which may have been masking the performance gains. I have suspended this work in favor of 0.90 pre-release work for now.
