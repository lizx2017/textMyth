Summary:
TestHFilePerformance should not be a unit test, but a tool
Description:
TestHFilePerformance is a very old test, which does not test anything, but a perf evaluation tool. It is not clear to me whether there is any utility for keeping it, but that should at least be converted to be a tool.
Note that TestHFile already covers the unit test cases (writing hfile with none and gz compression). We do not need to test SequenceFile.
