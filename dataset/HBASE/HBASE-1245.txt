Summary:
hfile meta block handling bugs
Description:
HFile doesn't handle 'get meta block' when there are no meta blocks. It throws an unhelpful exception "meta index not loaded", which is not the case. No meta blocks = no meta index. It should return null instead.
Additionally, hfile doesn't even get all meta names properly, due to the incorrect use of the file's comparator, instead of using just a bytes comparator in the index. This is manifested by NPEs in some tests.
