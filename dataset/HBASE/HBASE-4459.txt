Summary:
HbaseObjectWritable code is a byte, we will eventually run out of codes
Description:
There are about 90 classes/codes in HbaseObjectWritable currently and Byte.MAX_VALUE is 127. In addition, anyone wanting to add custom classes but not break compatibility might want to leave a gap before using codes and that's difficult in such limited space.
Eventually we should get rid of this pattern that makes compatibility difficult (better client/server protocol handshake) but we should probably at least bump this to a short for 0.94.
