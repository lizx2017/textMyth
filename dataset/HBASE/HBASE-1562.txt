Summary:
How to handle the setting of 32 bit versus 64 bit machines
Description:
After adding the tests to verify the correctness of the HeapSize calculations the question of where to set the type of machines that are in the cluster arose.
I would think that most people are using 64 bit machines but we still need to support the use of 32 bit. So the way I see it we can solve this problem in two ways,
we can either have a settable parameter the the user sets when starting up the cluster or we can try to figure it out ourselves. I think that the second solution would
be the best, to make it as easy as possible on the user.
That means that we need to add extra sizes to HeapSize and maybe even to Bytes.
Thoughts, comments?
