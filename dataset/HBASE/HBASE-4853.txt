Summary:
HBASE-4789 does overzealous pruning of seqids
Description:
Working w/ J-D on failing replication test turned up hole in seqids made by the patch over in hbase-4789. With this patch in place we see lots of instances of the suspicious: 'Last sequenceid written is empty. Deleting all old hlogs'
At a minimum, these lines need removing:

... but above is no good w/o figuring why WALs are not being rotated off.
