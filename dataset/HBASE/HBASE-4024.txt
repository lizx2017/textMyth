Summary:
Major compaction may not be triggered, even though region server log says it is triggered
Description:
The trunk version of regionserver/Store.java, method List<StoreFile> compactSelection(List<StoreFile> candidates) has this code to determine whether major compaction should be done or not:
// major compact on user action or age (caveat: we have too many files)
boolean majorcompaction = (forcemajor || isMajorCompaction(filesToCompact))
&& filesToCompact.size() < this.maxFilesToCompact;
The isMajorCompaction(filesToCompact) method internally determines whether or not major compaction is required (and logs this as "Major compaction triggered ... " log message. However, after the call, the compactSelection method subsequently applies the filesToCompact.size() < this.maxFilesToCompact check which can turn off major compaction.
This would result in a "Major compaction triggered" log message without actually triggering a major compaction.
The filesToCompact.size() check should probably be moved inside the isMajorCompaction(filesToCompact) method.
