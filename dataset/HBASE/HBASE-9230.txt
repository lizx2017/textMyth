Summary:
Fix the server so it can take a pure pb request param and return a pure pb result
Description:
Working on the asynchbase update w/ B this afternoon so it can run against 0.95/0.96, I noticed that clients HAVE TO do cellblocks as the server is currently. That is an oversight. Lets fix so can do all pb all the time too (I thought this was there but it is not); it will make it easier dev'ing simple clients.
This issue shouldn't hold up release but we should get it in to help the asynchbase convertion.
