Summary:
Reuse the thread pool in the shell to not run out of threads
Description:
I was trying some stuff in the shell and tried just to get a few puts in a loop to a table. I quickly ran out of threads (java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: unable to create new native thread).
It seems we create a new HTable per get/put/etc call. We could just reuse one thread pool instead.
