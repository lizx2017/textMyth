Summary:
Very inefficient behaviour of scan using FilterList
Description:
The behaviour of scan is very inefficient when using with FilterList.
The FilterList rewrites the return code from NEXT_ROW to SKIP from a filter if Operator.MUST_PASS_ALL is used.
This happens when using ColumnPrefixFilter. Even though the ColumnPrefixFilter indicates to jump to NEXT_ROW because no further match can be found, the scan continues to scan all versions of a column in that row and all columns of that row because the ReturnCode from ColumnPrefixFilter has been rewritten by the FilterList from NEXT_ROW to SKIP.
This is particularly inefficient when there are many versions in a column because the check is performed on all versions of the column instead of just by checking the qualifier of the column name.
