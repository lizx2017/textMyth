Summary:
Disabling table while splitting leaves regions in transition
Description:
With my "crazy conf" that causes tons of splits, I had a 2000 region table, which I disabled while inserting data (similar to HBASE-3345). This time I didn't get NPE, but I ended up with 68 regions stuck in transition (disable never finished)
