Summary:
Scanner misses columns / rows when the scanner is obtained durring a memcache flush
Description:
I first noticed that some columns for a row were missing if they are coming from a scanner that was obtained while a memecache flush on the region was in progress. I tried to write a simple unit test to reproduce, however the problem I get in the unit test is that some rows are being missed.
