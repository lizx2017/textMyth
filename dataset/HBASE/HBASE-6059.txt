Summary:
Replaying recovered edits would make deleted data exist again
Description:
When we replay recovered edits, we used the minSeqId of Store, It may cause deleted data appeared again.
Let's see how it happens. Suppose the region with two families(cf1,cf2)
1.put one data to the region (put r1,cf1:q1,v1)
2.move the region from server A to server B.
3.delete the data put by step 1(delete r1)
4.flush this region.
5.make major compaction for this region
6.move the region from server B to server A.
7.Abort server A
8.After the region is online, we could get the deleted data(r1,cf1:q1,v1)
(When we replay recovered edits, we used the minSeqId of Store, because cf2 has no store files, so its seqId is 0, so the edit log of put data will be replayed to the region)
