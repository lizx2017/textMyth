Summary:
[0.92 UNIT TESTS] TestReplication.queueFailover occasionally fails [Part-2]
Description:
The failure is in TestReplication.queueFailover (fails due to unreplicated rows). I have come across two problems:
1. The sleepMultiplier is not properly reset when the currentPath is changed (in ReplicationSource.java).
2. ReplicationExecutor sometime removes files to replicate from the queue too early, resulting in corresponding edits missing. Here the problem is due to the fact the log-file length that the replication executor finds is not the most updated one, and hence it doesn't read anything from there, and ultimately, when there is a log roll, the replication-queue gets a new entry, and the executor drops the old entry out of the queue.
