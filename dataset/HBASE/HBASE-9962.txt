Summary:
Improve tag iteration
Description:
The tag iterator was moved out of KeyValue into CellUtil and marked as for tests only. HBASE-7662 and HBASE-7663 will use it. The 'length' parameter was made into a short, which is inconvenient for most callers. The methods on Tag for getting tag data offset and length in the tag buffer were made default scope so it's impossible outside of the package to find the tag data in the backing buffer without calling Tag#asList, which might do some unwanted object allocations. Tags#asList also inconveniently uses short for 'length'.
