Summary:
Introduce ${hbase.local.dir} and save coprocessor jars there
Description:
We need to make the temp directory where coprocessor jars are saved configurable. For this we will add hbase.local.dir configuration parameter.
Windows tests are failing due to the pathing problems for coprocessor jars:
Two HBase TestClassLoading unit tests failed due to a failiure in loading the test file from HDFS:
testClassLoadingFromHDFS(org.apache.hadoop.hbase.coprocessor.TestClassLoading): Class TestCP1 was missing on a region
testClassLoadingFromLibDirInJar(org.apache.hadoop.hbase.coprocessor.TestClassLoading): Class TestCP1 was missing on a region
The problem is that CoprocessorHost.load() copies the jar file locally, and schedules the local file to be deleted on exit, but calling FileSystem.deleteOnExit(). However, the filesystem is not the file system of the local file, it is the distributed file system, so on windows, the Path fails.
