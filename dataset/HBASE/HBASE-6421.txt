Summary:
[pom] add jettison and fix netty specification
Description:
Currently, jettison isn't required for testing hbase-server, but TestSchemaConfigured requires it, causing the compile phase (at least on my MBP) to fail. Further, in cleaning up the poms, netty should be declared in the parent hbase/pom.xml and then inherited in the subclass.
