Summary:
ColumnAggregationEndPoint- Causes null pointer in RS when we pass null column qualifier
Description:
I was trying to use the ColumnAggregationEndPoint.sum().
In my sample is just created a column family but did not use any qualifier and inserted some data.
I tried to use ColumnAggregationEndPoint.sum(qualifier, null). When i did this inside the ColumnAggregationEndPoint we do
scan.addColumn(). This is adding the [null] array in the scan object. Later in the scanQueryMatcher it is throwing nullpointer exception.
I can understand that addColumn() is to specifiy the qualifier.
Do we need to document somewhere saying qualifier should not be null? I think coprocessors can be used even in places where we don't have qualifiers. If that is the case this sample ColumnAggregationEndPoint may not work.
