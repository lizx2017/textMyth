Summary:
LuceneDocumentWrapper Needs no argument constructor
Description:
For reading an object out a sequencefile, a no argument constructor is required...
if not you end up with a java.lang.NoSuchMethodException
From Owen O'Malley
Assumption for Writables that should be documented somewhere:
Each type must have a 0 argument constructor.
Each call to write must not assume any shared state.
Each call to readFields must consume exactly the number of bytes
produced by write.
SequenceFile also assumes:
All keys are exactly the same type (not polymorphic).
All values are exactly the same type.
Both types are specified by the writer in the create call.
