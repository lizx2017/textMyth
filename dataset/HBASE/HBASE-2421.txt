Summary:
Put hangs for 10 retries on failed region servers
Description:
Since MultiPut got in, instead of calling getRegionLocationForRowWithRetries we now call getRegionServerWithRetries to send an array list of Puts. The problem is that if the region server failed, we'll still retry the 10 times in a backoff fashion even tho we get connections refused. This is also true for a single put since it's the same code path.
Marking as critical since it almost disables our responsiveness to machine failures in certain cases where we are already sending a batch of edits when the server fails. Assigning to Ryan since he's been there recently.
