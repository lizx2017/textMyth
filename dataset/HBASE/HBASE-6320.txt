Summary:
assembly:single doesn't work after modularization
Description:
After modularization, the command to build the tarball on wiki:
http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/Hbase/HowToRelease
mvn clean site install assembly:single
Doesn't work any more.
[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-assembly-plugin:2.3:single (default-cli) on project hbase: Failed to create assembly: Artifact: org.apache.hbase:hbase-common:jar:0.95-SNAPSHOT (included by module) does not have an artifact with a file. Please ensure the package phase is run before the assembly is generated. -> [Help 1]
Matteo told me we have to use
mvn -DskipTests package assembly:assembly
I think we should make assembly:single work.
