Summary:
HBASE-3946 broke TestMasterFailover
Description:
TestMasterFailover is all about a new master coming up on an existing cluster. Previous to HBASE-3946, the new master joining a cluster processing any dead servers would assign all regions found on the dead server even if they were split parents. We don't want that.
But TestMasterFailover mocks up some pretty interesting conditions. The one we were failing on was that while the master was offine, we'd manually add a region to zk that was in CLOSING state. We'd then go and disable the table up in zk (while master was offline). Finally, we'd' kill the server that was supposed to be hosting the region from the disabled table in CLOSING state. Then we'd have the master join the cluster. It had to figure it out.
Before HBASE-3946, we'd just force offline every region that had been on the dead server. This would call all to be assigned only on assign, regions from disabled tables are skipped, so it all "worked" (except would online parent of a split should there be one).
