Summary:
Several tests failing after bulk output commit
Description:
Several tests are failing on Hudson after the commit of HBASE-1923 - see http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/HBase-TRUNK/1282/testReport/
These tests passed on local build, something seems to be different about the hudson environment.
