Summary:
Method Replication.decorateMasterConfiguration can fail with NPE in case that property HBASE_MASTER_LOGCLEANER_PLUGINS is not defined
Description:
While upgrading HBase dependency on Pig via PIG-3529, I've noticed that method Replication.decorateMasterConfiguration() can throw NullPointerException (code) in case when property HBASE_MASTER_LOGCLEANER_PLUGINS won't be defined.
The issue was more on a pig side where we weren't propagating default HBase configuration resources (such as hbase-default.xml), but I was curious if it's expected that this property will be always defined? We might want to tweak the code a bit if this property can be null.
