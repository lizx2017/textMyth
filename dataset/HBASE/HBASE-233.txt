Summary:
[hbase] Fix how hbase sits in hadoop 'package' product
Description:
Currently, hbase bin scripts and conf are present in the hadoop 'package' product but only under the src subdirectory; scripts are non-executable. If you try to run hbase from this location, it basically works if you chmod the scripts to make them executable but there are a few issues such as our not being able to find hbase stylesheets and logo.
Hbase should be easier to find and run inside of a hadoop package (as long as it lives inside hadoop). I'd suggest that packaged, hbase scripts are installed into $HADOOP_HOME/bin and that hbase-*.xml and hbase-env.sh get installed into $HADOOP_HOME/conf. Later we might add doc too.
