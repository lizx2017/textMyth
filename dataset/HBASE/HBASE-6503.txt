Summary:
HBase Shell Documentation For DROP Is Outdated
Description:
HBase Shell help documentation for the drop command says:
"If table has more than one region, run a major compaction on .META."
According to JD this is old news:
jdcryans: back in the days when hadoop didn't support durability it was possible to lose .META. data so we were force flushing .META. and major compacting it all the time also we used to have consistency issues that major compacting was solving ahhh the good old days
