Summary:
Dead region server pulled in from ZK
Description:
When a cluster restarts quickly after it's crashed, although a new region server is reported in, the master still pulls in the dead region server from the zk.

We should not pull in the second region server instance from zk. It is actually dead. We can figure this out by the hostname, and the port. We can assume no two region server instances can be alive on the same host, the same port. To be more cautious, we can check the timestamp as well. The live one should be that with the late timestamp, not pulled in from zk.
