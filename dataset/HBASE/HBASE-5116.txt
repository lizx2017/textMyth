Summary:
Remove double assignment of regions
Description:
As part of HBASE-5094 we found the possibility of doubly assignments of regions. This JIRA is to avoid such double assignments.
The idea is to get the regions corresponding to an RS in the the META and compare the regions online in the RS. Remove those regions from the online list if they dont match.
