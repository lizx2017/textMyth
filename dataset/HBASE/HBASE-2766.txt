Summary:
cluster may not recover if RS hosting ROOT and META together crashes
Description:
If both ROOT and .META. are located on the same regionserver, and that regionserver crashes, the master is unable to reassign these tables to a new regionserver.

"I ran a webtable scenario up on EC2 using the latest TM-2 and a cluster with 1 ZK, 1 master, 5 slaves, and 1 auxiliary node, using the HBase cluster scripts at https://tm-files.s3.amazonaws.com/hbase-ec2.tar.bz2. On the aux node I uploaded the Faulkner utility – https://tm-files.s3.amazonaws.com/faulkner.tar.gz – and ran the 'webtable.sh' script in that tarball. On the master I waited about 30 minutes for a fair amount of regions to proliferate and then ran:
nice -10 hbase shell
hbase> count 'TestTable'
and walked away, leaving it to chew on the heavy write load and scan.
At some point during this test scenario a region server crashed, due to a JVM segfault. The client (Faulkner) never recovered.
As far as I can see, in this test scenario the master never reassigns regions away from a crashed RS."
