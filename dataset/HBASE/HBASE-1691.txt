Summary:
hbase 0.20 on hadoop 0.19 (WAS ->Cannot connect to 0.20 HBase from an MR job running on a 0.19.0 version of Hadoop)
Description:
When running MR jobs on 0.19.0 Hadoop, the hadoop core libraries get loaded by the classloader before 0.20 libraries included in the job jar. HBaseClient makes a call to org.apache.hadoop.net.NetUtils.connect on line 305 which does not exist in previous versions of the hadoop jars and therefore results in NoSuchMethodErrors getting thrown.
As a simple workaround, you can replace the call
NetUtils.connect(socket, remoteId.getAddress(), 20000);
with
socket.connect(remoteId.getAddress(), 20000);
Note, however, that the javadoc on the NetUtils.connect() method makes mention of sun's implementation of stuff being less than wonderful, so the existence of this JIRA and this workaround should not be taken as meaning that this is actually a recommended solution.
