Summary:
OOME in Master splitting logs when the edits are BIG; 4-15MB
Description:
In a thread up in the mailing list, http://search-hadoop.com/m/fNaPh2YtTKc1/%2522HMaster+startup+is+very+slow%252C+and+always+run+into+out-of-memory+issue%2522&subj=Re+HMaster+startup+is+very+slow+and+always+run+into+out+of+memory+issue, it looks like big cells are causing log splitting to OOME. The user is splitting 200 logs. Look into this.
