Summary:
Some FilterList Constructors break addFilter
Description:
Some of the constructors for FilterList set the internal list of filters to list types which don't support the add operation. As a result
FilterList(final List<Filter> rowFilters)
FilterList(final Filter... rowFilters)
FilterList(final Operator operator, final List<Filter> rowFilters)
FilterList(final Operator operator, final Filter... rowFilters)
may init private List<Filter> filters = new ArrayList<Filter>(); incorrectly.
