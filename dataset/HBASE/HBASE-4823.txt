Summary:
long running scans lose benefit of bloomfilters and timerange hints
Description:
When you have a long running scan due to say an MR job, you can lose the benefit of timerange hints & bloom filters midway if your scanner gets reset. [Note: The scanners can get reset say due to a flush or compaction].
In one of our workloads, we periodically want to do rollups on recent 15 minutes of data in a column family... but the timerange hint benefit is lost midway when this resetScannerStack (shown below) happens. And end result-- we end up reading all the old HFiles rather than just the recent HFiles.
 private void resetScannerStack(KeyValue lastTopKey) throws IOException {
    if (heap != null) {
      throw new RuntimeException("StoreScanner.reseek run on an existing heap!");
    }

    /* When we have the scan object, should we not pass it to getScanners()
     * to get a limited set of scanners? We did so in the constructor and we
     * could have done it now by storing the scan object from the constructor */
    List<KeyValueScanner> scanners = getScanners();
The comment in the code seems to be aware of this issue and even has the suggested fix!
