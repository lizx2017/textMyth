Summary:
Race condition after table is re-enabled: regions are incorrectly reported as being available.
Description:
For a table that is re-enabled shortly after it is disabled, regions that are reported to be online are not. This is manifested by a flush attempt throwing a NotServingRegion exception despite all regions from the original table reporting that they are online.
I have a test in place that verifies this flaky behavior.
