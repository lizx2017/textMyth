Summary:
Fix TestKillingServersFromMaster in TRUNK; it just hangs since new master went in
Description:
This test depends on mechanisms much changed after new master went in so it just hangs; its not getting the confirmations it used expect. This issue is about recasting the test – because what it tests is useful (just reading the test I found bug in new master) – so need to get it going again. Marking critiical for 0.90.
