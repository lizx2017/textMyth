Summary:
binary keys broken on trunk
Description:
The symptom is commits fail with 'table not found' exception - even though the table does in fact exist!
Digging in a little with debug logs indicate that getClosestRowBefore() is returning NULL, which for a table that exists should never be! A key always falls into a region - either the first or the last one at the very least.
