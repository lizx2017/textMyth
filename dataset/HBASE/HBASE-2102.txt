Summary:
package version used when building contribs is out of sync
Description:
We are hard coding the package version in src/contrib/build-contrib.xml and it has been out of sync with the package version in the top level build.xml file since 0.20.0. Maybe it would be better to keep the package version in a single separate file (/version.xml?) and include it from all build files?
