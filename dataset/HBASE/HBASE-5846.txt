Summary:
HBase rpm packing is broken at multiple places
Description:
Here is how I executed rpm build:
MAVEN_OPTS="-Xmx2g" mvn clean package assembly:single -Prpm -DskipTests
The issues with the rpm build are:
There is no clean (%clean) section in the hbase.spec file . Last run can leave stuff in RPM_BUILD_ROOT which in turn will fail build. As a fix I added 'rm -rf $RPM_BUILD_ROOT' to %clean section
The Buildroot is set to _build_dir . The build fails with this error.
cp: cannot copy a directory, `/data/9adda425-1f1e-4fe5-8a53-83bd2ce5ad45/app/jenkins/workspace/hbase.92/target/rpm/hbase/BUILD', into itself, `/data/9adda425-1f1e-4fe5-8a53-83bd2ce5ad45/app/jenkins/workspace/hbase.92/target/rpm/hbase/BUILD/BUILD'
If we set it to ' %{_tmppath}/%
{name}
-%
{version}
-root' build passes
The src/packages/update-hbase-env.sh script will leave inconsistent state if 'yum update hbase' is executed. It deletes data from /etc/init.d/hbase* and does not put scripts back during update.
