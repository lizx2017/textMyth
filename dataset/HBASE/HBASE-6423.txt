Summary:
Writes should not block reads on blocking updates to memstores
Description:
We have a big data use case where we turn off WAL and have a ton of reads and writes. We found that:
1. flushing a memstore takes a while (GZIP compression)
2. incoming writes cause the new memstore to grow in an unbounded fashion
3. this triggers blocking memstore updates
4. in turn, this causes all the RPC handler threads to block on writes to that memstore
5. we are not able to read during this time as RPC handlers are blocked
At a higher level, we should not hold up the RPC threads while blocking updates, and we should build in some sort of rate control.
