Summary:
getScanner hangs with some startRows that are found if scanning entire table
Description:
I have a table with 8 byte binary row keys. There are a a few hundred thousands rows, each with two families and between 1k and 50k of total data across about 15 columns.
When attempting to get a scanner using a specified startRow, my client freezes on the HT.getScanner(cols,row) with no exception ever thrown and no debug output in any server logs.
If I get a scanner with HT.getScanner(cols) and then iterate through, I will eventually reach the row I was seeking before successfully.
Some rows can be found, some cannot. At this point I'm not able to distinguish anything special about the ones that cause the client the hang.
At first I thought this was only a problem with 0.19 trunk as a downgrade to 0.18 resolved the issue for a particular key. However other keys still have this issue on 0.18 branch.
