Summary:
Stagger Major Compactions
Description:
For pre-split regions, we can get into a case where the oldest HFile in a Store is pretty large and will not encounter a compaction within the 24hr major compact window. If that's the case, we don't want multiple multi-GB major compactions being triggered at the same time. Add ability to stagger the major compaction expiration window.
