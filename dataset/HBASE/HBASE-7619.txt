Summary:
tiny correction in the book
Description:
The following StoreFiles exist: 100, 25, 12, and 12 bytes apiece (oldest to newest). With the above parameters, the files that would be selected for minor compaction are 23, 12, and 12.
Why?
100 --> No, because sum(25, 12, 12) * 1.0 = 47
25 --> No, because sum(12, 12) * 1.0 = 24
12 --> No. Candidate because sum(12) * 1.0 = 12, there are only 2 files to compact and that is less than the threshold of 3
12 --> No. Candidate because the previous StoreFile was, but there are not enough files to compact
