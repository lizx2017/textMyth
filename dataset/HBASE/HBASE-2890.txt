Summary:
Initialize RPC JMX metrics on startup
Description:
Currently RPC call metrics are created dynamically based on cluster activity. So when monitoring via JMX, not all RPC statistics may be present in the exported MBean, depending on what the past cluster activity has been.
HBASE-2146 has previously added code to initialize the MBean attributes on startup for all RPC methods, but in a way that depended on the defunct code -> method name mappings.
This issue is to initialize the exported MBean attributes in a cleaner way, by introspecting the RPC protocol interfaces (HMasterInterface, HMasterRegionInterface, HRegionInterface).
