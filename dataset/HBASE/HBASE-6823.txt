Summary:
[WINDOWS] TestSplitTransaction fails due to the Log handle not released by a call to DaughterOpener.start()
Description:
There are two unit test cases in HBase RegionServer test failed in the clean up stage that failed to delete the files/folders created in the test.
testWholesomeSplit(org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.TestSplitTransaction): Failed delete of ./target/test-
data/1c386abc-f159-492e-b21f-e89fab24d85b/org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.TestSplitTransaction/table/a588d813fd26280c2b42e93565ed960c
testRollback(org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.TestSplitTransaction): Failed delete of ./target/test-data/6

The root cause is triggered by ta call to the DaughterOpener.start() in \src\hbase\src\main\java\org\apache\hadoop\hbase\regionserver\SplitTransactopn.Java (openDaughters() function). It left handles to the splited folder/file and causing deleting of the file/folder failed in the Windows OS.
Windows does not allow to delete a file, while there are open file handlers.
