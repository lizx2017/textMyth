Summary:
A bunch of tests have client retries only but bulid boxes are contended and overloaded
Description:
Let me up the retries so more likely tests will fail.
I went over a bunch of those w/ retries == 1 but most times it is what is wanted... a fail fast. In snapshot test it is set to 1 retry only but seems like it could do w/ more retrying since a bunch of them load data first and it can take a while for stuff to come on line on loaded server. See this failure:
http://54.241.6.143/job/HBase-0.95-Hadoop-2/org.apache.hbase$hbase-server/720/testReport/org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client/TestSnapshotFromClient/testSnapshotDeletionWithRegex/
Says....
org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.RetriesExhaustedWithDetailsException: Failed 4600 actions: SocketTimeoutException: 4600 times,
It is in the loadTable at start of the test.
