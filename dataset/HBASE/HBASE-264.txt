Summary:
hbase scanner api returns null row names, or skips row names if different column families do not have entries for some rows
Description:
I'm attaching a test case that fails.
I noticed that if I create a table with two column families, and start a scanner on a row which only has an entry for one column family, the scanner will skip ahead to the row name for which the other column family has an entry.
eg., if I insert rows so my table will look like this:
row - a:a - b:b
aaa   a:1   nil
bbb   a:2   b:2
ccc   a:3   b:3
The scanner will tell me my table looks something like this:
row - a:a - b:b
bbb   a:1   b:2
bbb   a:2   b:3
