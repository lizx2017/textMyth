Summary:
MemStore.USEMSLAB_DEFAULT is false, hbase-default.xml says it's true
Description:
Someone not familiar with the MemStore code might find it confusing that MemStore.USEMSLAB_DEFAULT's value is "false" whereas hbase.hregion.memstore.mslab.enabled is true in hbase-default.xml (and in the end hbase-default.xml is the one used).
This should be harmonized to true.
