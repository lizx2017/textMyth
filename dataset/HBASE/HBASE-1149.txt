Summary:
Dataloss when master and region server die at same time
Description:
To reproduce:
1) Run HBase in standalone mode
2)
create 'foo', 'bar'
3) kill -9 the HBase server
4) Restart hbase
The table 'foo' will not exist.
Apparently this problem happens because the master and region servers die at the same time. To me that suggests a fairly large flaw â€“ if your cluster has a systematic failure (say, a power outage) it would cause data loss.
