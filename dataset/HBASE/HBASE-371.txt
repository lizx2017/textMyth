Summary:
HBase | bin/stop_hbase.sh returns before it completes
Description:
The HBase shutdown command ${HBASE_HOME}/bin/stop_hbase.sh returns before HBase has actually stopped. This creates difficulty for users who may then accidentally stop the Hadoop daemons before HBase has stopped. To address this, the shutdown command should hang until HBase has stopped instead of returning immediately.
