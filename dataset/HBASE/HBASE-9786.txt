Summary:
[hbck]: hbck -metaonly incorrectly reports inconsistent regions after HBASE-9698 fix
Description:
In my testing, I found that this call began to fail:
sudo -u hbase hbase hbck -metaonly
The checking after which it began to fail is: after this checkin: https://github.com/apache/hbase/commit/818749ff9f261aac4206054d331189e92290b408
The full output is below. The issue seems the patch does not include -metaOnly
Testing done:
I build 0.96 up to commit a6f208d91efff207860b049eb8466a069f0c71a9 and the test passes.
The output:
$ hbase org.apache.hadoop.hbase.PerformanceEvaluation --rows=10000 sequentialWrite 1
$ hbase hbck -metaonly
