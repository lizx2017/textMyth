Summary:
[REST] Sending HTML for errors is unhelpful
Description:
The large HTML 404 page returned by Stargate is not helpful. The REST interface is not intended for humans to read, esp. when the client is known to be a program because it's asking for binary, but really any time. Nice big readable error pages use bandwidth and clutter network traces to no purpose.
Please allow the 404 and other error pages to be configured away, or just stop sending them (my preference). If some body must be sent, a simple text/plain "Not found" would be fine, I think.
