Summary:
HBase clients cannot recover when their ZooKeeper session becomes invalid
Description:
Someone made mention of this loop last week but I don't think I filed an issue. Here is another instance, again from a secret hbase admirer:
"It seems that when Zookeeper dies and restarts, all client applications need to be restarted too. I just restarted HBase in non-distributed mode (which includes a ZK) and now my application can't reconnect to ZK unless I restart it too. I'm stuck in this loop:
2010-07-19 00:13:05,725 INFO org.apache.zookeeper.server.NIOServerCnxn:
  Closed socket connection for client /127.0.0.1:55153 (no session established for client)
2010-07-19 00:13:07,052 INFO org.apache.zookeeper.server.NIOServerCnxn:
  Accepted socket connection from /127.0.0.1:55154
2010-07-19 00:13:07,053 INFO org.apache.zookeeper.server.NIOServerCnxn:
  Refusing session request for client /127.0.0.1:55154 as it has seen zxid 0xf5 our last zxid is 0xd7
