Summary:
[Thrift2] TDelete.deleteType defaults to TDeleteType.DELETE_COLUMNS, but the docs suggest otherwise
Description:
It seems to me there is an inconsistency (or error) in the Thrift2 TDelete struct and its documentation. The docs for the TDelete struct state:
If no timestamp is specified the most recent version will be deleted. To delete all previous versions, specify the DELETE_COLUMNS TDeleteType.
...which implies that the default is TDeleteType.DELETE_COLUMN (singular), not TDeleteType.DELETE_COLUMNS (plural).
However, the deleteType field in the TDelete struct defaults to the value 1, which is TDeleteType.DELETE_COLUMNS (plural) in /src/main/resources/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/thrift2/hbase.thrift. The field is currently (r1239241) defined as follows:
4: optional TDeleteType deleteType = 1,
I'd suggest that the default for this optional field is changed to TDeleteType.DELETE_COLUMN (singular). The line above from the TDelete struct would then become:
4: optional TDeleteType deleteType = 0,
Since this change just involves changing a 1 into a 0, I'll leave the trivial patch to someone who can also commit it in one go. Thanks in advance.
