Summary:
SplitLogWorker fails to let go of a task, kills the RS
Description:
I hope I didn't break spacetime continuum, I got this while testing 0.92.0:
2011-12-20 03:06:19,838 FATAL org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.SplitLogWorker: logic error - end task /hbase/splitlog/hdfs%3A%2F%2Fsv4r11s38%3A9100%2Fhbase%2F.logs%2Fsv4r14s38%2C62023%2C1324345935047-splitting%2Fsv4r14s38%252C62023%252C1324345935047.1324349363814 done failed because task doesn't exist

I'll post more logs in a moment. What I can see is that the master shuffled that task around a bit and one of the region servers died on this stack trace while the others were able to interrupt themselves.
