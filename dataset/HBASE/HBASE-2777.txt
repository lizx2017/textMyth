Summary:
Disabling table doesn't work if there are uncleaned splits in META
Description:
I can run "disable" on a table from the shell lots of times, and it never actually disables it. It seems this happens when there are split markers in META for that table. After the MetaScanner runs and cleans them up, I can disable the table.
