Summary:
DFSClient names in master and RS should be unique
Description:
In the post-newmaster trunk, there's some code which gives the regionserver and masters fancy names based on hostname and port. This breaks log recovery, though, if the master starts recovering a log (ie has an append lease on a log file), then crashes and comes back on the same port. The NN doesn't see this as a new client, since the client name is the same, so it thinks it still holds a lease on the file. The new master, though, can't call append() because the NN thinks it's appending, so it loops forever.
