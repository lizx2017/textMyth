Summary:
TestAdmin failing in 0.92 because .tableinfo not found
Description:
I've been running tests before commit and found the following happens with some regularity, sporadic of course, but they fail fairly frequently:
Failed tests:   testOnlineChangeTableSchema(org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.TestAdmin)
  testForceSplit(org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.TestAdmin): expected:<2> but was:<1>
  testForceSplitMultiFamily(org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.TestAdmin): expected:<2> but was:<1>
Looking, it seems like we fail to find .tableinfo in the tests that modify table schema while table is online.
The update of a table schema just does an overwrite. In the tests we sometimes fail to find the newly written file or we get EOFE reading it.
