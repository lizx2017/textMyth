Summary:
Enabling gc logging makes ugly output starting daemons...
Description:
From an hbase admirer:
"t seems that having -verbose:gc in $HBASE_OPTS in
conf/hbase-env.sh is making some scripts unhappy:
$ ./bin/start-hbase.sh
[1: ssh: [1: Name or service not known
CMS-initial-mark:: ssh: CMS-initial-mark:: Name or service not known
6696K(83008K),: ssh: 6696K(83008K),: Name or service not known
0K(63872K)]: ssh: 0K(63872K)]: Name or service not known
secs]: ssh: secs]: Name or service not known
[Times:: ssh: [Times:: Name or service not known
...."
I've seen this myself.
