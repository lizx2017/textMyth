Summary:
HTTP status code incorrect for error conditions
Description:
When there is a error given in the UI/JSPs, the HTTP status code is not set accordingly.
For example, if the page output for master.jsp is:
{{HTTP ERROR: 500
Trying to contact region server null for region , row '', but failed after 3
attempts.
Exceptions:
org.apache.hadoop.hbase.NotServingRegionException:
org.apache.hadoop.hbase.NotServingRegionException: ROOT,,0}}
The HTTP status code sent with the response is still "HTTP/1.1 200 OK". This is a red herring for some types of monitoring, though it is debatable if an HTTP status code of 4xx/5xx reflect the server state or the state of the system being monitored. It may well be that HTTP 200 is OK, since the HTTP UI is responsive and correctly indicating a failed HBase cluster.
