Summary:
SequenceFileLogWriter doesnt make it clear if there is no append by config or by missing lib/feature
Description:
This code doesnt make the situation clear:
Method m = null;
if (conf.getBoolean("dfs.support.append", false)) {
try {
// function pointer to writer.syncFs()
m = this.writer.getClass().getMethod("syncFs", new Class<?> []{});
} catch (SecurityException e)
{ throw new IOException("Failed test for syncfs", e); }
catch (NoSuchMethodException e)
{ // Not available }
}
this.syncFs = m;
LOG.info((this.syncFs != null)?
"Using syncFs – HDFS-200": "syncFs – HDFS-200 – not available");
we dont know if the test failed, or if the config is turned off. it would make debuggers life easier if the message was clearer.
