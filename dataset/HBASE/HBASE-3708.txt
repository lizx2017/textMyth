A user complains that its making for lots of logging every second over on the zk ensemble:
14:59 ....seeing lots of these in the ZK log though, dozens per second of "Got user-level KeeperException when processing sessionid:0x42daa1daab0ecbe type:create cxid:0x1 zxid:0xfffffffffffffffe txntype:unknown reqpath:n/a Error Path:/hbase Error:KeeperErrorCode = NodeExists for /hbase"
