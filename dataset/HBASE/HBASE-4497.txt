Summary:
If region opening fails after updating META HBCK reports it as inconsistent and scanning the region throws NSRE
Description:
As per the discussion in the mail chain "HBCK reporting of possible mismatch in RS assignment" this JIRA is created.
Consider two RS-> RS1 and RS2.
A region tries to open in RS1. But it takes a while. The RS1 has still not updated meta and transitioned the node from OPENING to OPENED
So timeout assigns the region to RS2. RS2 successfully updates the META and opens the region.
Now RS1 tries to act on the region by first updating the META and then transiting the node to OPENING to OPENED.
RS1 transiting the node to OPENING to OPENED will fail. But the META entry will have RS1 as the latest.
Now HBCK reports this as an inconsistency and if we try to scan the Region we get NotServingRegionException.
