Summary:
[replication] ReplicationSink uses the ts of the first KV for the other KVs in the same row
Description:
ReplicationSink assumes that all the KVs for the same row inside a WALEdit will have the same timestamp, which is not necessarily the case.
This only affects 0.90 and 0.92 since HBASE-5203 fixes it in 0.94
