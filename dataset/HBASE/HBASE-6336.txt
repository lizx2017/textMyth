Summary:
Split point should not be equal to start row or end row
Description:
Should we allow split point equal with region's start row or end row?
// if the midkey is the same as the first and last keys, then we cannot
        // (ever) split this region.
        if (this.comparator.compareRows(mk, firstKey) == 0 &&
            this.comparator.compareRows(mk, lastKey) == 0) {
          if (LOG.isDebugEnabled()) {
            LOG.debug("cannot split because midkey is the same as first or " +
              "last row");
          }
Here, I think it is a mistake.
