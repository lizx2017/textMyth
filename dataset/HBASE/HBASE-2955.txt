Summary:
hbase-2692 broke replication
Description:
hbase-2692 introduced new pattern for zk use. Replication uses zk heavily and depended on old pattern and classes. I brought some of the replication zk forward but j-d offerered to finish the job after hbase-2692 went in. Thats what this issue is about. Assigned it to j-d (thanks).
