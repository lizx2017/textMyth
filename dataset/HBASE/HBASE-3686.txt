Summary:
ClientScanner skips too many rows on recovery if using scanner caching
Description:
This can cause rows to be lost from a scan.
See this thread where the issue was brought up: http://search-hadoop.com/m/xITBQ136xGJ1
If hbase.regionserver.lease.period is higher on the client than the server we can get this series of events:
1. Client is scanning along happily, and does something slow.
2. Scanner times out on region server
3. Client calls HTable.ClientScanner.next()
4. The region server throws an UnknownScannerException
5. Client catches exception and sees that it's not longer then it's hbase.regionserver.lease.period config, so it doesn't throw a ScannerTimeoutException. Instead, it treats it like a NSRE.
Right now the workaround is to make sure the configs are consistent.
A possible fix would be to use whatever the region server's scanner timeout is, rather than the local one.
