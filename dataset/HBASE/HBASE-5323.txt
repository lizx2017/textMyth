Summary:
Need to handle assertion error while splitting log through ServerShutDownHandler by shutting down the master
Description:
We know that while parsing the HLog we expect the proper length from HDFS.
In WALReaderFSDataInputStream
              assert(realLength >= this.length);
We are trying to come out if the above condition is not satisfied. But if SSH.splitLog() gets this problem then it lands in the run method of EventHandler. This kills the SSH thread and so further assignment does not happen. If ROOT and META are to be assigned they cannot be.
I think in this condition we abort the master by catching such exceptions.
Please do suggest.
