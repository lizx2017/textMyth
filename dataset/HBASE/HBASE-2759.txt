Summary:
ZKMasterAddressWatcher gets confused by events on other zknodes
Description:
I deleted a node in the UNASSIGNED dir, and saw this in the logs. I think it's harmless, but worth fixing:
2010-06-20 21:16:15,008 DEBUG org.apache.hadoop.hbase.master.HMaster: Event NodeDeleted with state SyncConnected with path /hbase/UNASSIGNED/1028785192
2010-06-20 21:16:15,008 DEBUG org.apache.hadoop.hbase.master.ZKMasterAddressWatcher: Got event NodeDeleted with path /hbase/UNASSIGNED/1028785192
2010-06-20 21:16:15,008 DEBUG org.apache.hadoop.hbase.master.ZKMasterAddressWatcher: Master address ZNode deleted, notifying waiting masters
