Summary:
Suggested JDWP debug options in hbase-env.sh are wrong
Description:
In the default hbase-env.sh in trunk, there's a section for lines you can uncomment to enable JDWP remote debugging:
    # Enable remote JDWP debugging of major HBase processes. Meant for Core Developers 
    # export HBASE_MASTER_OPTS=" -Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=8070"
    # export HBASE_REGIONSERVER_OPTS="$HBASE_REGIONSERVER_OPTS -Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=8071"
    # export HBASE_THRIFT_OPTS="$HBASE_THRIFT_OPTS -Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=8072"
    # export HBASE_ZOOKEEPER_OPTS="$HBASE_ZOOKEEPER_OPTS -Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=8073"
However, this is wrong (at least, if you're starting from local source), because somewhere in the chain of start-hbase.sh, it sources hbase-env.sh more than once, which has the effect of including these options twice, which makes the JVM barf on startup, saying
"ERROR: Cannot load this JVM TI agent twice, check your java command line for duplicate jdwp options. Error occurred during initialization of VM; agent library failed to init: jdwp".
Removing the first re-included instance of $HBASE_MASTER_OPTS (etc.) solves the problem. This should either be changed in the default or these scripts shouldn't source hbase-env.sh multiple times I think.
