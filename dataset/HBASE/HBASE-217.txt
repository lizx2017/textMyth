Summary:
[hbase] Fix critical shutdown problem introduced by HADOOP-2338
Description:
HADOOP-1338 introduced a critical problem in region server shutdown.
when a region server is told by the master to quiesce, closing a region can cause a concurrent split to fail, possibly corrupting the region.
In addition, the master may never transition from quiesce to full shutdown, leaving some region servers still running in quiesce state.
