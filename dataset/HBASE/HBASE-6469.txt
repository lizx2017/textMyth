Summary:
Failure on enable/disable table will cause table state in zk to be left as enabling/disabling until master is restarted
Description:
In Enable/DisableTableHandler code, if something goes wrong in handling, the table state in zk is left as ENABLING / DISABLING. After that we cannot force any more action from the API or CLI, and the only recovery path is restarting the master.
    if (done) {
      // Flip the table to enabled.
      this.assignmentManager.getZKTable().setEnabledTable(
        this.tableNameStr);
      LOG.info("Table '" + this.tableNameStr
      + "' was successfully enabled. Status: done=" + done);
    } else {
      LOG.warn("Table '" + this.tableNameStr
      + "' wasn't successfully enabled. Status: done=" + done);
    }
Here, if done is false, the table state is not changed. There is also no way to set skipTableStateCheck from cli / api.
We have run into this issue a couple of times before.
