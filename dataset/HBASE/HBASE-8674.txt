Summary:
JUnit and Surefire TRUNK-HBASE-2 plugins need a new home
Description:
people.apache.org cannot currently host personal or transient Maven repos.
$ curl --connect-timeout 60 -v  http://people.apache.org/~garyh/mvn/org/apache/maven/plugins/maven-remote-resources-plugin/1.4/maven-remote-resources-plugin-1.4.pom

* Closing connection 0
curl: (28) Connection timed out after 60064 milliseconds
All builds are at the moment broken if the HBase custom junit or surefire jars are not already in cache. Even if this is a temporary condition, we should find a new home for these artifacts, upgrade to versions that include our submitted changes (if any), or fall back to release versions.
