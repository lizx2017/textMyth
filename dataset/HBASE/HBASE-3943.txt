Summary:
Propagate compaction status from HRegion to HServerLoad.RegionLoad
Description:
Load balancer works with HRegionInfo. However, compaction status is contained in HRegion.WriteState
Users reported the following (Schubert Zhang):
1. A region have many files, the compacting takes long time.
2. But the balancer (default 5 minutes) close and move this region to
another server.
3. Then, the compacting start again.
4. Then, then balancer close and move it to another server.
Thus, the compacting cannot complete.
Now, we set the balancer interval to 30 minutes to remission this issue.
We need to propagate compaction status to HServerLoad.RegionLoad so that load balancer doesn't move the region which is being compacted.
