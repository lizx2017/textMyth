Summary:
[hbase] RESTful interface
Description:
A RESTful interface would be one means of making hbase accessible to clients that are not java. It might look something like the below:
+ An HTTP GET of http://MASTER:PORT/ outputs the master's attributes: online meta regions, list of tables, etc.: i.e. what you see now when you go to http://MASTER:PORT/master.jsp.
+ An HTTP GET of http://MASTER:PORT/TABLENAME: 200 if tables exists and HTableDescription (mimetype: text/plain or text/xml) or 401 if no such table. HTTP DELETE would drop the table. HTTP PUT would add one.
+ An HTTP GET of http://MASTER:PORT/TABLENAME/ROW: 200 if row exists and 401 if not.
+ An HTTP GET of http://MASTER:PORT/TABLENAME/ROW/COLUMNFAMILY: HColumnDescriptor (mimetype: text/plain or text/xml) or 401 if no such table.
+ An HTTP GET of http://MASTER:PORT/TABLENAME/ROW/COLUMNNAME/: 200 and latest version (mimetype: binary/octet-stream) or 401 if no such cell. HTTP DELETE would delete the cell. HTTP PUT would add a new version.
+ An HTTP GET of http://MASTER:PORT/TABLENAME/ROW/COLUMNNAME/TIMESTAMP: 200 (mimetype: binary/octet-stream) or 401 if no such cell. HTTP DELETE would remove. HTTP PUT would put this record.
+ Browser originally goes against master but master then redirects to the hosting region server to serve, update, delete, etc. the addressed cell
