2012-08-22 20:16:02,427 INFO org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.HRegionServer: Attempting connect to Master server at ine-60.rfiserve.net,60000,1345680901361
2012-08-22 20:16:09,501 INFO org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.HRegionServer: Connected to master at ine-51.rfiserve.net/172.22.2.51:60020
Bug is introduced by a typo, the variable isa is declared both as a field in class and local variable in the method printing this line.
LOG.info("Connected to master at " + isa);
