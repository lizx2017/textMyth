Summary:
Remove unnecessary Guava Dependency
Description:
Currently, TableMapReduceUtil uses Guava for trivial functionality and addDependencyJars() currently adds Guava by default. However, this jar is only necessary for the ImportTsv MR job. This is annoying when naively bundling hbase jar with a MR job because you now need a second dependency jar. Should default bundle with only critical dependencies and have jobs that need fancy Guava functionality explicitly include them.
