Summary:
Javadoc in some Filters ambiguous
Description:
The javadoc on some of the filter is somewhat confusing.
The main Filter interface has methods that behave like a sieve; when filterRowKey returns true, that means that the row is filtered out (not included).
Many of the Filter implementations work the other way around. When the condition is met the value passes (ie, the row is returned).
Most Filters make it clear when a values passes (passing through the filter meaning the values are returned from the scan).
Some are less clear in light of how the Filter interface works: WhileMatchFilter and SingleColumnValueFilter are examples.
