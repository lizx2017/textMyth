Summary:
Revisit IncrementColumnValue implementation in 0.22
Description:
right now we are using too much of the old get code, we need to review that and constrain how this works but without breaking ICV.
Also we should be resetting the timestamp on every ICV call, and removing the older version. Instead of 'updating' an ICV "in place" we should be adding a new one, removing the old one from memstore (if it is there). This will play well with the atomic approach added in HBASE-2248 since we are only touching 1 KeyValue at a time.
