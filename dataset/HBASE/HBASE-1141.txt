Summary:
Fetching large numbers of columns is slow outside of HDFS
Description:
While working on a Cell cache, we have found during random-read tests that the number of columns has an enormous impact on performance. Accounting for increased HDFS access time, there is still a great deal of time being spent coming out of the Region and then across the wire to HTable.
Erik Holstad has done this testing and will post some of his results here when completed.
