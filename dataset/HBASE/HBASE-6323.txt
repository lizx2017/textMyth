Summary:
[replication] most of the source metrics are wrong when there's multiple slaves
Description:
Most of the metrics in replication were written with 1 slave in mind but with multiple slaves the issue really shows. Most of the metrics are set directly:
public void enqueueLog(Path log) {
  this.queue.put(log);
  this.metrics.sizeOfLogQueue.set(queue.size());
}
So sizeOfLogQueue is always showing the size of the queue that updated the metric last.
I'm not sure what's the right way to fix this since we can't have dynamic metrics. Merging them would work here but it wouldn't work so well with ageOfLastShippedOp since the age can be different and it definitely cannot be summed.
Assigning to Elliott since he seems to dig metrics these days.
