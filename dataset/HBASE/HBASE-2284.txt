Summary:
fsWriteLatency metric may be incorrectly reported
Description:
fsWriteLatency metric is computed by maintaining writeTime & writeOps in HLog. If an HLog.append() carries multiple edits, then "writeTime" is computed incorrectly for the subsequent edits because doWrite() is called for each of the edits with the same start time argument ("now").
This also causes a lot of false WARN spews to the log. Only one of the edits might have taken a long time, but every edit after that in a given HLog.append() operation will also raise these warning messages.
