Summary:
Quick Start Guide shows stable version as 0.95, in the stable folder it is 0.94
Description:
In the Quick Start Guide for HBase - http://hbase.apache.org/book/quickstart.html
The stable version is mentioned as - 0.95 in the line -
"Choose a download site from this list of Apache Download Mirrors. Click on the suggested top link. This will take you to a mirror of HBase Releases. Click on the folder named stable and then download the file that ends in .tar.gz to your local filesystem; e.g. hbase-0.95-SNAPSHOT.tar.gz."
But in the download folder at - http://apache.techartifact.com/mirror/hbase/stable/
The version that can be found is - hbase-0.94.2-security.tar.gz i.e. 0.94
So either the documentation or the download folder needs to be updated.
