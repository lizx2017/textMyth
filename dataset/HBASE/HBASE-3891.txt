Summary:
TaskMonitor is used wrong in some places
Description:
I have a long running log replay in progress but none of the updates show. This is caused by reusing the MonitorTask references wrong, and manifests itself like this in the logs:
2011-05-16 15:22:18,127 WARN org.apache.hadoop.hbase.monitoring.TaskMonitor: Status org.apache.hadoop.hbase.monitoring.MonitoredTaskImpl@51bfa303 appears to have been leaked
2011-05-16 15:22:18,128 DEBUG org.apache.hadoop.hbase.monitoring.MonitoredTask: cleanup.
The cleanup sets the completion timestamp and causes the task to be purged from the list. After that the UI for example does not show any further running tasks, although from the logs I can see (with my log additions):
2011-05-16 15:29:52,296 DEBUG org.apache.hadoop.hbase.monitoring.MonitoredTask: setStatus: Compaction complete: 103.1m in 18542ms
2011-05-16 15:29:52,296 DEBUG org.apache.hadoop.hbase.monitoring.MonitoredTask: setStatus: Running coprocessor post-compact hooks
2011-05-16 15:29:52,296 DEBUG org.apache.hadoop.hbase.monitoring.MonitoredTask: setStatus: Compaction complete
2011-05-16 15:29:52,297 DEBUG org.apache.hadoop.hbase.monitoring.MonitoredTask: markComplete: Compaction complete
They are silently ignored as the TaskMonitor has dropped their reference. We need to figure out why a supposedly completed task monitor was reused.
