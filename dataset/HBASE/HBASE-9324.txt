Summary:
TestProcedureMember#testMemberCommitException, testSimpleRun & testMemberCommitCommsFailure are flaky on Suse OS
Description:
The failures are due to a race condition that sub procedure could finish before the sub procedure is added into internal map ProcedureMember#subprocs. Below is the related code:
      future = this.pool.submit(subproc);
      synchronized (subprocs) {
        subprocs.put(procName, subproc);
      }
As you can see the above, that subproc could finish before
subprocs.put(procName, subproc);
. Therefore, the test will fail with the following error message:
procedure.ProcedureMember(189): Unexpected reached glabal barrier message for Sub-Procedure 'some op'
