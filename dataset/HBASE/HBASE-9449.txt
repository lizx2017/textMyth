Summary:
document how to use shell enhancements from HBASE-5548
Description:
HBASE-5548 introduced new behavior for shell commands like 'list' to make them act more ruby-like. There is no documentation for this in the refguide. We should
1) have an example in the shell sectoin
2) document the that new '=> #xxx.x..' line is expected
We can probably lift a bunch of docs from HBASE-5548.
