Summary:
Some RegionServer metrics have really confusing names
Description:
Mikael Sitruk commented on this back in Nov 2011 and after looking at this I completely agree with him. For example, "flushSize_avg_time" makes no sense. "flushSize" is in bytes, so is this the average flush size? Or the average time per flush? In which case, why not call the measure "flush_avg_time". But to add to the confusion there is already a "flushTime_avg_time" metric. There is also "flushTime_num_ops" and "flushSize_num_ops" that are confusing. Is the former the number of flushes? In which case, why have "time" in the metric name?

Hi
I have enabled metrics on Hbase cluster (0.90.1), and mapped the metrics
to
3 categories (missing, Present but not documented/Incomplete
documentation,Ok) according to their status in the book (
http://hbase.apache.org/book.html#hbase_metrics). Is it possible to udpate
the book accordingly?
It seems also that rpc metrics are not documented at all.
And now some questions on the metrics:
I can see some metrics present a num_ops and avg_time suffix (like rpc)
but
it seems that for certain metrics is it totally unclear (to me at least)
or
their name is missleading - for example what
means compactionTime_avg_time/compactionTime_num_ops? or
flushSize_avg_time
and flushSize_num_ops? I mean I would have understood compaction_avg_time
and flushSize or flush_avg_time.
