Summary:
CacheOnWrite broken in some cases because it can conflict with evictOnClose
Description:
Commit of HBASE-4078 added some extra StoreFile verification which just did an open of a StoreFile reader and then closes it, ensuring there's no exception. If evict-on-close is on, which it is by default, this causes all blocks of a file to be evicted even though it's still open.
We need to add the boolean into the close call in the way we have booleans for cacheBlocks at some point since we need to make localized decisions in some cases.
In lots of places, we can always rely on cacheConf.shouldEvictOnClose() so shouldn't be too burdensome.
