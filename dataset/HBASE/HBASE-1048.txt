Description:
Above was in tim sell log just before it OOME'd. 1450 log files are going to mess us up. Need to clear them. Catalog tables should probably keep up the old optional flush or, if N commit logs, schedule a flush on the region with the oldest sequent number.
Bringing into 0.19.0. Gets in the way of our scaling.
