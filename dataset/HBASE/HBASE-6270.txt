Summary:
If all data is locally cached, undo locking and context switching so we are cpu bound
Description:
See Dhruba's blog here towards the end where he talks about HBase: http://hadoopblog.blogspot.com.es/2012/05/hadoop-and-solid-state-drives.html
He says that when all data is local and cached, we bind ourselves up with locks and context switching, so much so, that we are unable to use all CPU.
