Thanks for making the RC, Stack. I bumped into one thing which I thought I
should bring up in the context of singularity - the ServerName message in
hbase.proto should have the start_code as a signed int. We allow for -1 (
ServerName.NON_STARTCODE) as a start_code. Hence.. Yes it can be worked
around, and, maybe there won't any wire-compat issues if we make the change
later (not sure about it) but I think we should fix it now. What do you
think?

For illustration, here is the proposed fix.

 }
Will make this fix in next RC if there is one. Filing against 0.96.1 for now.
