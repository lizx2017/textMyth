Summary:
Remove WatcherWrapper and have all users of ZooKeeperWrapper supply a Watcher.
Description:
We originally wrote a WatcherWrapper for our ZooKeeperWrapper which cuts through some of the ZooKeeper interface so that we wouldn't have to supply Watchers everywhere. Now that we're having to deal with things like Session Expired all over the place, this class should no longer be used.
