Summary:
hbase.apache.org website javadoc is missing info from newer classes
Description:
Some of the newer classes are missing from the javadoc on the webepage. For example, go here:
http://hbase.apache.org/apidocs/index.html
and then attempt to go into the o.a.h.h.master.snapshot, o.a.h.h.code.prefixtree, o.a.h.h.errorhandling (and many other packages) and you'll get a not found error message form the webserver.
I believe they were just not svn added last time to docs were refreshed.
