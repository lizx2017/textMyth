Summary:
OOME running randomRead PE (Disable blanket enabling of blockcache)
Description:
Blockcache is misbehaving on TRUNK. Something is broke. We OOME about 20% into the randomRead test. Looking at heap, its all soft references. Instrumenting the referencequeue, we're never clearing full gc'ing. Something is off.
