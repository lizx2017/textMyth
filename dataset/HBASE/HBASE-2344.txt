Summary:
InfoServer and hence HBase Master doesn't fully start if you have HADOOP-6151 patch
Description:
This is was due to a minor issue on the HBase side. The hadoop HttpServer prior to HADOOP-6151 was more tolerant than now.
In /org/apache/hadoop/hbase/util/InfoServer.java, addDefaultApps() adds a null key to the defaultContexts map. After HADOOP-6151, the HttpServer code raises a NPE. And hence HBase master doesn't fully start.
Will submit the patch shortly.
