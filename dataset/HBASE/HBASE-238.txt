Summary:
[hbase] Possible data loss if Exception happens between snapshot and flush to disk.
Description:
There exists a little window during which we can lose data. During a memcache flush, we make an inmemory copy, a 'snapshot'. The memcache is then zeroed and off we go again taking updates. Meantime, in background we are supposed to flush the snapshot to disk. If this process is interrupted – e.g. the HDFS is yanked from under us or if an OOME occurs in this thread – then the content of the snapshot is lost.
