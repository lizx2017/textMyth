Summary:
Coprocessors: RegionObserver: ScannerNext and ScannerClose hooks are called when get() is invoked
Description:
RegionObserver upcalls are expected to be triggered by corresponding client calls.
I found that if a HTable.get() is issued, ScannerNext, and ScannerClose hooks are also invoked.
Here is the reason: HRegion.get() is implemented with an internal scanner:
    InternalScanner scanner = null;
    try {
      scanner = getScanner(scan);
      scanner.next(results);
    } finally {
      if (scanner != null)
        scanner.close();
    }
where scanner.next, and scanner.close() are implemented with RegionObserver hooks.
