Summary:
Jenkins build failing; failsafe NPE'ing
Description:
Builds up on jenkins have been failing over the last few days. Looking at it w/ nkeyway, its kinda odd. I ran exact command locally as did N and it works fine. I removed all of my repo and still works. N looked at surefire source. Its the includes that is coming back empty causing the NPE we see up on jenkins. Extra odd is that it does not seem like it a checkin of ours that brought this on. See here where its 'working' on 0.94 branch: https://builds.apache.org/view/G-L/view/HBase/job/HBase-0.94/76/ Then a little later Ted triggers a build w/ no changes made: https://builds.apache.org/view/G-L/view/HBase/job/HBase-0.94/77/console
Its failing running the integration test phase. Let me mess around and try and get it going again.
