Summary:
RegionMovedException can cause servers to play ping pong with client
Description:
I need to double check the code, but from some logs it appears that if region moves from A to B, then from B to A, and then closed on A for reason that is not move (not clear what), and is assigned to C, A and B will play ping-pong with the client for a while until some serendipitous occasion refreshes meta.
