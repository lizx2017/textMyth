Summary:
0.20.0 TableInputFormatBase NPE
Description:
Spot the bug in this code:
public List<InputSplit> getSplits(JobContext context) throws IOException {
byte [][] startKeys = table.getStartKeys();
if (startKeys == null || startKeys.length == 0)
{ throw new IOException("Expecting at least one region."); }
if (table == null)
{ throw new IOException("No table was provided."); }
...
}
Should check if the table is null before calling a method on it.
Admittedly, this isn't the worst bug in the world, it's really just more of a nuisance in that the "No table was provided" message becomes an NPE
