Summary:
Mechanism for atomic recovery from partial failure when atomically bulk-loading multi-CF rows.
Description:
The suggestions from HBASE-4552 and initial implementations could violate row atomicity if there is a failure while bulk-loading multiple CF rows. A mechanism to atomically rollback or commit only upon completion (mvcc at the store level) is needed if a partial failures encountered when attempting to bulk load multiple families.
For example, let's say I want to bulk load a region with cfs A, B, C. I issue a call to an RS region to atomically bulkload the HFiles. The RS loads A and B successfully but fails on C (hdfs failure, or rs goes down, etc). We could rollback A and B - if we don't we would have A and B loaded but not C and have an atomicity violation.
