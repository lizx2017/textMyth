Summary:
HTable.ClientScanner needs to clone the Scan object
Description:
The ClientScanner can make some changes to the Scan object like setting a new start row when it gets an error, so if someone was reusing that object for a new scan thinking it would have the same properties, he/she would currently be wrong.
