Summary:
HBase shell disable_all/enable_all/drop_all promp wrong tables for confirmation
Description:
When using hbase shell to disable_all/enable_all/drop_all tables, the tables prompted for confirmation are wrong.
For example, disable_all 'test*'
will ask form confirmation to diable tables like:
mytest1
test123
Fortunately, these tables will not be disabled actually since Java pattern doesn't match this way.
