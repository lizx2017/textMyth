Summary:
Wait until regions are assigned in TestSplitTransactionOnCluster
Description:
I've seen various failures where a table is created in the tests and then all regions are retrieved from the cluster, where the number of returned regions is 0, because the region have not been assigned, yet, or the AM does not know about them, yet.
