Summary:
[shell] deleteall ignores column if specified
Description:
In the shell, a delete must match the value's coordinates exactly. By default the delete command uses the latest timestamp but you can provide on explicitly. So you have to delete each version independent of the others if there are multiple versions of a value.
The command 'deleteall' is supposed to clear out a whole row or a whole column of values:
 deleteall Delete all cells in a given row; pass a table name, row, and optionally 
           a column and timestamp
but the code won't work as advertised:
    def deleteall(row, column = nil, timestamp = HConstants::LATEST_TIMESTAMP)
      now = Time.now 
      d = Delete.new(row.to_java_bytes, timestamp, nil)
      @table.delete(d)
      @formatter.header()
      @formatter.footer(now)
    end
'column' is ignored.
