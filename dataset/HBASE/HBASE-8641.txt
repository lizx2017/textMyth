Summary:
IndexBuilder example : CF name of the src table is hard coded
Description:
When running the IndexBuilder example we can pass the tablename, family name and qualifier name for indexing that data. But in the code the family name is hard coded to be only "attributes". So this example will work only when family name of the src table is "attributes"
