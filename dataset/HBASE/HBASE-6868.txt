Summary:
Skip checksum is broke; are we double-checksumming by default?
Description:
The HFile contains checksums for decrease the iops, so when Hbase read HFile , that dont't need to read the checksum from meta file of HDFS. But HLog file of Hbase don't contain the checksum, so when HBase read the HLog, that must read checksum from meta file of HDFS. We could add setSkipChecksum per file to hdfs or we could write checksums into WAL if this skip checksum facility is enabled
