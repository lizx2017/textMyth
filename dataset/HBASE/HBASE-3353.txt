Summary:
table.jsp doesn't handle entries in META without server info
Description:
I have a table where one of the rows in META is missing server info. table.jsp doesn't check for this case, so it throws an NPE, which is then dumped to the .out log rather than anywhere where someone might find it. We should catch this case.
