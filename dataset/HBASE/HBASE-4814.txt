Summary:
Starting an online alter when regions are splitting can leave their daughters unaltered
Description:
I've seen a situation where regions were splitting almost exactly at the same time as an alter command was issued and those regions' daughters were left unaltered. It would even seem that the daughters' daughters also share this situation.
Reopening all the regions fixes the problem.
