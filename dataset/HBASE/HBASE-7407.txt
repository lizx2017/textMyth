Summary:
TestMasterFailover under tests some cases and over tests some others
Description:
The tests are done with this settings:
conf.setInt("hbase.master.assignment.timeoutmonitor.period", 2000);
conf.setInt("hbase.master.assignment.timeoutmonitor.timeout", 4000);
As a results:
1) some tests seems to work, but in real life, the recovery would take 5 minutes or more, as in production there always higher. So we don't see the real issues.
2) The tests include specific cases that should not happen in production. It works because the timeout catches everything, but these scenarios do not need to be optimized, as they cannot happen.
