Summary:
ZooKeeper: Master's ephemeral node went away while it was still up and functioning normally
Description:
Does the master watch its own znode? Right around the time of regionserver problems described in HBASE-1311, clients could no longer find the master, but according to its log it was up and functionling normally. I think the master and regionserver sessions expired at the same time, as they were started within seconds of each other.
