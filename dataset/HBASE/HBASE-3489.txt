Summary:
.oldlogs not being cleaned out
Description:
The .oldlogs folder is never being cleaned up. The hbase.master.logcleaner.ttl has been set to clean up the old logs but the clean up is never kicking in. The limit of 10 files is not the problem. After running for 5 days not a single log file has ever been deleted and the logcleaner is set to 2 days (from the default of 7 days). It is assumed that the replication changes that want to be sure to keep these logs around if needed have caused the cleanup to be blocked. There is no replication defined (knowingly).
