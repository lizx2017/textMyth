Summary:
Store scanner does not consult filter.filterRow at end of scan
Description:
I have impelemented a columnValueFilter (with new interface) that should filter out the last of two rows in a table. However, I notice that filterRow is only being called on the first row, and the second row is returned.
This patch fixes it, but needs review. My first attempt at adding the call in the DONE_SCAN case did not fix it, but still seems right. The second addition at the end of the method fixed it.
