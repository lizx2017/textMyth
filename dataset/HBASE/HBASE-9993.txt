Summary:
0.94: HBASE-9865 breaks coprocessor compatibility with WALEdit.
Description:
  public List<KeyValue> getKeyValues() {
Was changed to
  public ArrayList<KeyValue> getKeyValues() {
This break existing coprocessors (such as those used in Phoenix).
It's fine to change in 0.96+, but in 0.94 it should remain backwards compatible.
James Taylor, FYI.
