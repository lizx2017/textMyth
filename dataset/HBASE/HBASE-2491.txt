Summary:
master.jsp uses absolute links to table.jsp. This broke when master.jsp moved under webapps/master
Description:
In the latest trunks / 0.21 branch, the master's web UI sits under /webapps/master. All links to the specific tables fail to work, because the master.jsp uses absolute links for them - e.g. href="/table.jsp".
Although the fact that the master pages shouldn't be under /webapps/master ( see HBASE-2369), these links should still be relative to the master page - href="table.jsp", considering that they are not called from anywhere else.
