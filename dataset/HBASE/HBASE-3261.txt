Summary:
NPE out of HRS.run at startup when clock is out of sync
Description:
This is what I get when I start a region server that's not properly sync'ed:
Exception in thread "regionserver60020" java.lang.NullPointerException
 at org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.HRegionServer.run(HRegionServer.java:603)
 at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:637)
I this case the line was:
hlogRoller.interruptIfNecessary();
I guess we could add a bunch of other null checks.
The end result is the same, the RS dies, but I think it's misleading.
