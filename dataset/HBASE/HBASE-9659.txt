Summary:
some integration tests can no longer be run using maven
Description:
When I run mvn test (or verify) - Dtest=IntegrationTestIngest, the test fails instantly, seemingly because initialization doesn't run. I am assuming junit is not picking before-after methods from the superclass, could be some other issue.
Also, if it does run, it won't be very useful because it runs with calm monkey by default.
We need to detect being run locally rather than as AbstractHBaseTool (probably any time JUnit-annotated methods like Before are called), and set up a different chaos monkey, such as an old default one.
May also apply to other tests.
