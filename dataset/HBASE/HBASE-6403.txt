Summary:
RegionCoprocessorHost provides empty config when loading a coprocessor
Description:
I started playing with Giraffa. I am running it against Hadoop 2.0.0-alpha, and current HBase trunk. On line 159 of RegionCoprocessorHost, the server's configuration is copied... or at least an attempt is made to copy it. However, the server's configuration object, a CompoundConfiguration, does not store the data in the same way as the base Configuration object, and so nothing is copied. This leaves the coprocessor without access to configuration values, like the fs.defaultFS, which Giraffa is looking for.
