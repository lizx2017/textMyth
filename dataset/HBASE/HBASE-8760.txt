Summary:
possible loss of data in snapshot taken after region split
Description:
Right after a region split but before the daughter regions are compacted, we have two daughter regions containing Reference files to the parent hfiles.
If we take snapshot right at the moment, the snapshot will succeed, but it will only contain the daughter Reference files. Since there is no hold on the parent hfiles, they will be deleted by the HFile Cleaner after they are no longer needed by the daughter regions soon after.
A minimum we need to do is the keep these parent hfiles from being deleted.
