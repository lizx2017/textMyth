Summary:
HTable.batch does not have to be synchronized
Description:
This was raised on the mailing list by Yousuf.
HTable.batch(...) is synchronized and there appears to be no reason for it.
(flushCommits makes the same call to connection.processBatch and it also is not synchronized)
This is pretty bad actually marking critical.
0.96 is fine BTW.
