Summary:
updates to existing tables do not get reflected after a complete HBase + Hadoop + Zookeeper restart
Description:
I have an existing hbase table with data in it. When I restart hadoop, hbase and zookeeper, I am able to read all of the data that existed in the table prior to the restart. However when I write data to the table, it does not get reflected.
When I do a disable <table> and then an enable <table> on an hbase shell. The data that was written to the table now appears and the table is up to date. However, even after this my thrift client still sees the old data and not the updated values.
