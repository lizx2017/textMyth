Summary:
upsert doesn't matchFamily() before removing key
Description:
org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.MemStore.upsert(KeyValue) doesn't match family before deciding to remove a kv in the memstore
// if the qualifier matches and it's a put, remove it
if (kv.matchingQualifier(cur)) {
// to be extra safe we only remove Puts that have a memstoreTS==0
if (kv.getType() == KeyValue.Type.Put.getCode() &&
kv.getMemstoreTS() == 0)
{ // false means there was a change, so give us the size. addedSize -= heapSizeChange(kv, true); it.remove(); }
shouldn't it be "if the family and qualifier match and it's a Put, remove it"?
