Summary:
ServerName is created using getLocalSocketAddress, breaks binding to the wildcard address. Revert HBASE-8640
Description:
In HBASE-8148 I added a way to bind to specific addresses, like 0.0.0.0, but right now in 0.95/trunk the ServerName is created using getLocalSocketAddress in RpcServer so 0.0.0.0 gets published in ZK.
