Summary:
RS gets stuck compacting region ad infinitum
Description:
Testing 0.20_pre_durability@934643, I ended up in a state where one region server got stuck compacting a single region over and over again forever. This was with a special config with very low flush threshold in order to stress test flush/compact code.
