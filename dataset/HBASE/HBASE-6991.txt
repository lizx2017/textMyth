Summary:
Escape "\" in Bytes.toStringBinary() and its counterpart Bytes.toBytesBinary()
Description:
Since "\" is used to escape non-printable character but not treated as special character in conversion, it could lead to unexpected conversion.
For example, please consider the following code snippet.
public void testConversion() {
  byte[] original = {
      '\\', 'x', 'A', 'D'
  };
  String stringFromBytes = Bytes.toStringBinary(original);
  byte[] converted = Bytes.toBytesBinary(stringFromBytes);
  System.out.println("Original: " + Arrays.toString(original));
  System.out.println("Converted: " + Arrays.toString(converted));
  System.out.println("Reversible?: " + (Bytes.compareTo(original, converted) == 0));
}

Output:
-------
Original: [92, 120, 65, 68]
Converted: [-83]
Reversible?: false
The "\" character needs to be treated as special and must be encoded as a non-printable character ("\x5C") to avoid any kind of ambiguity during conversion.
