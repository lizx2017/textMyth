Summary:
Using the same HBaseConfiguration for multiple puts makes some data not to be written
Description:
I created a DAO object for loading and storing data into HBase. The DAO has a HBaseConfiguration field, created inside the DAO constructor. Each DAO's method creates a new HTable using the class's HBaseConfiguration. The problem shows up when subsequent writings (using a put) are invoked, since not all the data is written. Moreover this behaviour is not deterministic: invoking the same writings never writes all the data, but the missing ones change every time.
I solved this situation removing the class's HBaseConfiguration and creating a new HBaseConfiguration inside each method.
