Summary:
Master doesn't see regionserver edits because of clock skew
Description:
The streamy folks had a cluster where regionserver was 2 minutes in advance of the master. On split, regionserver would update .META. with split info but scanners opened on the master wouldn't see the edits because they were being opened using current time.
