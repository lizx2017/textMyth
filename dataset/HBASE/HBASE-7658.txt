Summary:
grant with an empty string as permission should throw an exception
Description:
If someone specify an empty permission
grant 'user', ''
AccessControlLists.addUserPermission() output a log message and doesn't change the permission, but the user doesn't know about it.
if ((actions == null) || (actions.length == 0)) {
  LOG.warn("No actions associated with user '"+Bytes.toString(userPerm.getUser())+"'");
  return;
}
I think we should throw an exception instead of just logging.
