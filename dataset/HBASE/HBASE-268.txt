Summary:
[hbase] Web UI with report on cluster state and basic browsing of tables
Description:
Hbase should put up a simple webapp listing content of master in-memory data structures listing cluster members, tables and other vital statistics. Some admin facility for editing column properties w/ table enable/disable features would also go here. A basic (read-only?) means of listing tables and their attributes, and for browsing table content – perhaps w/ support for HQL queries – would also be useful confirming uploads, debugging, etc.
