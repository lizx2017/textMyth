Summary:
MetaReader.tableExists should not return false if the specified table regions has been split
Description:
If a region is split parent we are not adding it to META scan results during full scan.
        if (!isInsideTable(this.current, tableNameBytes)) return false;
        if (this.current.isSplitParent()) return true;
        // Else call super and add this Result to the collection.
        super.visit(r);
If all regions of a table has been split then result size will be zero and returning false.
 
    fullScan(catalogTracker, visitor, getTableStartRowForMeta(tableNameBytes));
    // If visitor has results >= 1 then table exists.
    return visitor.getResults().size() >= 1;
Even table is present we are returning false which is not correct(its highly possible in case of tables with one region).
