Summary:
Don't use legal family name for system folder at region level
Description:
CHANGED, was: Don't allow "recovered.edits" as legal family name
Region directories can contain folders called "recovered.edits", log splitting related.
But there's nothing that prevent a user to create a family with that name...
HLog.RECOVERED_EDITS_DIR = "recovered.edits";
HRegion.MERGEDIR = "merges"; // fixed with HBASE-6158
SplitTransaction.SPLITDIR = "splits"; // fixed with HBASE-6158
