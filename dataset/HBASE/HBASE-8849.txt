Summary:
CellCodec should write and read the memstoreTS/mvccVersion
Description:
This JIRA is wrt discussion over in HBASE-8496.
Cell interface and the corresponding CellCodec provides a new way of serializing the Keyvalues.
Cell interface supports getMvccVersion() and the javadoc says it could be > 0 if it exists or 0 otherwise.
But we don't tend to write/read the memstoreTS/mvccVersion in the Cell codec.
