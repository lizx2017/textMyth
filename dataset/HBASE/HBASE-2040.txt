Description:
Two (somewhat) major things.
First when the LogSyncer thread is created it's expecting optionalFlushInterval but we pass logflushentries. What it means is that it will run every 100ms by default.
Also when the optional flush is running (meaning that no entries came in for that interval) and that logflushentries>1 then it won't do the hflush because we don't enforce it.
