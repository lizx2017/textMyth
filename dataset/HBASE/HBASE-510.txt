Summary:
HConnectionManger.listTables returns empty list if exception (though there may be many tables present)
Description:
Its a problem because commonly a check for existence will get list of current tables.
Yesterday saw problem when .META. went off line. A piece of client code was asking for list of tables when .META. was offline, it was getting back an empty list because listTables do while was seeing 'org.apache.hadoop.hbase.NotServingRegionException: .META.,,1'
Problem is the do while in HCM.listTables goes as long as startRow does not equal LAST_ROW but startRow is initialized with EMPTY_START_ROW which is equal to LAST_ROW.
