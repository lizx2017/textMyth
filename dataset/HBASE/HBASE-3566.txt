Summary:
writeToWAL is not serialized for increment operation
Description:
Class org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.Increment has a member
boolean writeToWAL;
that is not serialized/deserialized in write/readFields functions. As a result an operation to increment several columns within a single row always writes to WAL, even if a client calls
increment.setWriteToWAL(false);
