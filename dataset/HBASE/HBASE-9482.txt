Summary:
Do not enforce secure Hadoop for secure HBase
Description:
We should recommend and not enforce secure Hadoop underneath as a requirement to run secure HBase.
Few of our customers have HBase clusters which expose only HBase services to outside the physical network and no other services (including ssh) are accessible from outside of such cluster.
However they are forced to setup secure Hadoop and incur the penalty of security overhead at filesystem layer even if they do not need to.
The following code tests for both secure HBase and secure Hadoop.
org.apache.hadoop.hbase.security.User
  /**
   * Returns whether or not secure authentication is enabled for HBase.  Note that
   * HBase security requires HDFS security to provide any guarantees, so this requires that
   * both <code>hbase.security.authentication</code> and <code>hadoop.security.authentication</code>
   * are set to <code>kerberos</code>.
   */
  public static boolean isHBaseSecurityEnabled(Configuration conf) {
    return "kerberos".equalsIgnoreCase(conf.get(HBASE_SECURITY_CONF_KEY)) &&
        "kerberos".equalsIgnoreCase(
            conf.get(CommonConfigurationKeys.HADOOP_SECURITY_AUTHENTICATION));
  }
What is worse that if "hadoop.security.authentication" is not set to "kerberos" (undocumented at http://hbase.apache.org/book/security.html), all other configuration have no impact and HBase RPCs silently switch back to unsecured mode.
