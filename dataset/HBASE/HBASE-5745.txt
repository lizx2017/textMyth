Summary:
SequenceFileLogReader#getPos may get wrong length on DFS restart
Description:
This is actually a kind of integration bug from Hbase perspective.
Currently HDFS will count the partial block length as 0, if there are no locations found for the partial block. This can happend opn DFS restart, before DNs completely reports to NN.
Explained the scenario in HDFS-3222. Actually this is a bug in HDFS. we may solve this in latest versions.
So, whatever the versions Hbase using may have this bug. HMaster may not be able to replay the complete edits if there is an Hmaster switch also at the same time.
