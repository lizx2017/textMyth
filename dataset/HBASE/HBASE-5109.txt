Summary:
Fix TestAvroServer so that it waits properly for the modifyTable operation to complete
Description:
TestAvroServer has the following issue
impl.modifyTable(tableAname, tableA);
// It can take a while for the change to take effect. Wait here a while.
while(impl.describeTable(tableAname) == null )
{ Threads.sleep(100); }
assertTrue(impl.describeTable(tableAname).maxFileSize == 123456L);
impl.describeTable(tableAname) returns the default maxSize 256M right away as modifyTable is async. Before HBASE-4328 is fixed, we can fix the test code to wait for say max of 5 seconds to check if impl.describeTable(tableAname).maxFileSize is uploaded to 123456L.
