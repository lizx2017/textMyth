The patch attached:
fixes this for hadoop 1 profile
bump the netty version to 3.5.9
does not fix it for hadoop 2. I don't know why, but I haven't investigate: as it's still alpha may be they will change the version on hadoop side anyway.
Tests are ok.
I haven't really investigated the differences between netty 3.2 and 3.5. A quick search seems to say it's ok, but don't hesitate to raise a warning...
