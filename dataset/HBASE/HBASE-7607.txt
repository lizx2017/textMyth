Summary:
Fix TestRegionServerCoprocessorExceptionWithAbort flakiness in 0.94
Description:
TestRegionServerCoprocessorExceptionWithAbort fails sometimes both on trunk and 0.94.X. The codebase is different in both.
In 0.94.x, client retries to look at the root region, while the cluster is down and /hbase znode is no longer present.
"Check the value configured in 'zookeeper.znode.parent'. There could be a mismatch with the one configured in the master."
I will file a separate jira for the trunk as the code is different there.
