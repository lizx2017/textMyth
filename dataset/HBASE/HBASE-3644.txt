Summary:
HServerAddress Violates Equivalence Relations
Description:
See HBASE-3387 or http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-jtp05273.html#N10184 . Basically, 'a' denotes HServerAddress(DNS) & 'b' denotes HServerAddress(nslookup(DNS)). This is extremely common within HBase when 'conf/regionserver' contains DNS entries because ClusterStatus.getServers() is IP-based. You have a.address.equals(b.address) && !a.stringValue.equals(b.stringValue). In this case, a.equals(b) while a.hashCode() != b.hashCode().
