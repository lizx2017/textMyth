Summary:
Partial reverse of HBASE-9533
Description:
I don't understand the solution in HBASE-9533
In netty 3.3, they changed the group id, if I understand well for legal reasons see https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/103). But they have not changed the java package name: it's still org.jboss.netty. So we should not have to remove our dependency to netty 3.6.
So:
this comment is wrong imho: the explicit load is not related to the package name but to how mapreduce load work.
+      // This is ugly.  Our zk3.4.5 depends on the org.jboss.netty, not hadoops io.netty
+      // so need to load it up explicitly while on 3.4.5 zk
We do use Netty (for the multicast message), so now we're have a missing dependency, as maven says:
 [INFO] — maven-dependency-plugin:2.1:analyze (default-cli) @ hbase-client —
[WARNING] Used undeclared dependencies found:
[WARNING] org.jboss.netty:netty:jar:3.2.2.Final:compile
So I propose a partial reverse. Stack, [@Aleksandr Shulman] would it work for you?
