Summary:
Previous active master can still serves RPC request when it is trying recovering expired zk session
Description:
When the active master's zk session expires, it'll try to recover zk session, but without turn off its RpcServer. What if a previous backup master has already become the now active master, and some client tries to send request to this expired master by using the cached master info? Any problem here?
