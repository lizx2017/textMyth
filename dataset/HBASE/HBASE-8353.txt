Summary:
-ROOT-/.META. regions are hanging if master restarted while closing -ROOT-/.META. regions on dead RS
Description:
ROOT/META are not getting assigned if master restarted while closing ROOT/META.
Lets suppose catalog table regions in M_ZK_REGION_CLOSING state during master initialization and then just we are adding the them to RIT and waiting for TM.
        if (isOnDeadServer(regionInfo, deadServers) &&
            (data.getOrigin() == null || !serverManager.isServerOnline(data.getOrigin()))) {
          // If was on dead server, its closed now. Force to OFFLINE and this
          // will get it reassigned if appropriate
          forceOffline(regionInfo, data);
        } else {
          // Just insert region into RIT.
          // If this never updates the timeout will trigger new assignment
          regionsInTransition.put(encodedRegionName, new RegionState(
            regionInfo, RegionState.State.CLOSING,
            data.getStamp(), data.getOrigin()));
        }
isOnDeadServer always return false to ROOT/META because deadServers is null.
Even TM cannot close them properly because its not available in online regions since its not yet assigned.
    synchronized (this.regions) {
      // Check if this region is currently assigned
      if (!regions.containsKey(region)) {
        LOG.debug("Attempted to unassign region " +
          region.getRegionNameAsString() + " but it is not " +
          "currently assigned anywhere");
        return;
      }
    }
