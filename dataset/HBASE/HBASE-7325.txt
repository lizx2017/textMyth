Summary:
Replication reacts slowly on a lightly-loaded cluster
Description:
ReplicationSource uses a backing-off algorithm to sleep for an increasing duration when an error is encountered in the replication run loop. However, this backing-off is also performed when there is nothing found to replicate in the HLog.
Assuming default settings (1 second base retry sleep time, and maximum multiplier of 10), this means that replication takes up to 10 seconds to occur when there is a break of about 55 seconds without anything being written. As there is no error condition, and there is apparently no substantial load on the regionserver in this situation, it would probably make more sense to not back off in non-error situations.
