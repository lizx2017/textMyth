Summary:
Snapshots with the same name are allowed to proceed concurrently
Description:
Snapshots with the same name (but on different tables) are allowed to proceed concurrently.
This seems to be loop hole created by allowing multiple snapshots (on different tables) to run concurrently.
There are two checks in SnapshotManager, but fail to catch this particular case.
In isSnapshotCompleted(), we only check the completed snapshot directory.
In isTakingSnapshot(), we only check for the same table name.
The end result is the concurrently running snapshots with the same name are overlapping and messing up each other. For example, cleaning up the other's snapshot working directory in .hbase-snapshot/.tmp/snapshot-name.
