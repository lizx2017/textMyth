Summary:
Deprecate HTable[Interface].getRowOrBefore(...)
Description:
HTable's getRowOrBefore(...) internally calls into Store.getRowKeyAtOrBefore. That method was created to allow our scanning of .META. (see HBASE-2600).
Store.getRowKeyAtOrBefore(...) lists a bunch of requirements for this to be performant that a user of HTable will not be aware of.
I propose deprecating this in the public interface in 0.92 and removing it from the public interface in 0.94. If we don't get to HBASE-2600 in 0.94 it will still remain as internal interface for scanning meta.
Comments?
