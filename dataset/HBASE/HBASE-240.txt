Summary:
[hbase] TestDFSAbort failed in nightly #253
Description:
TestDFSAbort failed in nightly #253. It seems to have been the same failure mode as seen in HADOOP-1924 where the rpc Client is stuck on a flush. It actually happened twice during the build, once in TestDFSAbort and then again in a slight variation where this time the test client hung on the flush in TestRegionServerAbort. Jim managed to provoke a couple of thread dumps. See http://lucene.zones.apache.org:8080/hudson/job/Hadoop-Nightly/253/console.
