Summary:
HBase Shell has an issue accepting FILTER for the 'scan' command.
Description:
Stack had encountered+fixed an issue nearly a couple of years ago related to FILTER not being accepted by the 'scan' command in the shell. This, however, didn't make it to the trunk I believe. I hit it today while revamping some docs for HBASE-3539
