Summary:
Add RowFilter to HRegion.HScanner
Description:
I've implemented a RowFilterInterface and a RowFilter implementation. This is passed to the HRegion.HScanner via HClient.openScanner() though it is an entirely optional parameter.
HScanner applies the filter in the next() call by iterating until it encounters a row that is not filtered by the RowFilter. The filter applies criteria based on row keys and/or column data values.
Null values are little tricky since the resultSet in that loop may represent nulls as absent columns or as DELETED_BYTES. Nevertheless null cases are taken care of by the filter and you can for example retrieve all rows where column X = null.
The initial RowFilter implementation is limited in several ways:
Equality test only with literal values. No !=, <, >, etc. No col1 == col2. This is a straight-up byte[] comparison.
Multiple column criteria are treated as an implicit conjunction, no disjunction possible.
row key criteria is a regular expression only
row key criteria is independent of column criteria. No "if rowkey.matches(A) and col1==B" although the interface is created to allow for that.
But it should be easy to write an improved RowFilterInterface implementation to take care of most of the above without having to change code elsewhere.
