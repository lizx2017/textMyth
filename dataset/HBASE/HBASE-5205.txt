Summary:
Delete handles deleteFamily incorrectly
Description:
Delete.deleteFamily clears all other markers for the same family.
That is not correct as some of these other markers might be for a later time.
That logic should be removed.
If (really) needed this can be slightly optimized by keeping track of the max TS so far for each family.
If both the TS-so-far and the TS of a new deleteFamily request is < LATEST_TIMESTAMP and the TS-so-far is < deleteFamily marker, or if both the TS-so-far and the new TS equal LATEST_TIMESTAMP, then the previous delete markerz for that family could be removed.
I think that might be overkill, as most deletes issued from clients are for LATEST_TIMESTAMP (which the server translates to the current time).
I'll have a (one-line) patch soon. Unless folks insist on the optimization I mentioned above.
