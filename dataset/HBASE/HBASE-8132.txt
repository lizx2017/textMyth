Summary:
Master rebuild() should check for regioninfo count before ENABLING/DISABLING partial tables
Description:
After snapshots addition the adding of regioninfo into the META is more of atomic nature. This solves the problem that was raised in HBASE-5583.
But when we do a restart of master or failover of master we do not validate the regioninfo that was added to META if it was same as that was mentioned while creation of table.
This validation may be needed so that a master restart will enable to create the exact number of regions as given during the create table splitkeys.
