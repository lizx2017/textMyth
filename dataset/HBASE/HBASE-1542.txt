Summary:
Scan returns rows beyond the endRow when the column is specified
Description:
We ran into an issue where the scan resulted in rows beyond the endRow. Are we doing something incorrectly here? The test case is given below. When the scan.addColumn(...) is commented, the rows has
{ "row333" }
but having the scan.addColumn(...) in the scan gives rows
{ "row555" }
.
