Summary:
HBaseAdmin#isTableEnabled() should check table existence before checking zk state.
Description:
To avoid compatibility issues with older versions HBaseAdmin#isTableEnabled returning true even if the table state is null. Its also returning true even a table is not present. We should confirm table existence from .META. before checking in zk. If table not present or deleted, then It will throw TableNotFoundException.
