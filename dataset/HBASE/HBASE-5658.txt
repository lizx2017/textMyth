Summary:
pseduo-distributed.xml - first link pointing to wrong site
Description:
In the web-page 'pseudo-distributed.xml' the first link "Distributed Operation: Pseudo- and Fully-distributed modes" is linking to the Javadoc when it should be linking to the Reference Guide in the config section.
Thanks to Dave Wang for pointing this out.
