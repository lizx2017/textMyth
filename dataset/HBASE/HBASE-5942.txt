Summary:
HConnnectionManager.getRegionServerWithRetries doesn't call afterCall properly
Description:
HConnnectionManager.getRegionServerWithRetries:
          return callable.call();
        } catch (Throwable t) {
          callable.shouldRetry(t);
shouldRetry relies on the proper startTime and endTime to calculate the timeout value. However, callable.afterCall() is called in finally block. Thus callable.callTimeout will be set to negative value in callable.shouldRetry().
