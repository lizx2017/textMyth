Summary:
Memstore heapSize calculation - DEEP_OVERHEAD is incorrect
Description:
expected += ClassSize.estimateBase(ConcurrentSkipListMap.class, false);
expected += ClassSize.estimateBase(ConcurrentSkipListMap.class, false);
expected += ClassSize.estimateBase(CopyOnWriteArraySet.class, false);
expected += ClassSize.estimateBase(CopyOnWriteArrayList.class, false);
We need to consider the heap requirement for KeyValueSkipListSet.
From where CopyOnWriteArraySet & CopyOnWriteArrayList is coming into picture? I am not able to follow.
Also we need to consider the heap for TimeRangeTracker
