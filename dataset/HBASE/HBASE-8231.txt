Summary:
delete tests in table_tests.rb(TestShell) always running on empty table.
Description:
In ruby,tests within the same test class are invoked in alphabetical order,so delete test cases are running on a table before adding any entry.
TestShell logs showing "Row not found" for each delete test everytime.
ERROR: Row Not Found

Here is some help for this command:
Delete all cells in a given row; pass a table name, row, and optionally
a column and timestamp. Examples:

  hbase> deleteall 't1', 'r1'
  hbase> deleteall 't1', 'r1', 'c1'
  hbase> deleteall 't1', 'r1', 'c1', ts1

The same commands also can be run on a table reference. Suppose you had a reference
t to table 't1', the corresponding command would be:

  hbase> t.deleteall 'r1'
  hbase> t.deleteall 'r1', 'c1'
  hbase> t.deleteall 'r1', 'c1', ts1
Before deleting a row we are checking whether the row is present or not.
    def _deleteall_internal(row, column = nil, timestamp = org.apache.hadoop.hbase.HConstants::LATEST_TIMESTAMP)
      raise ArgumentError, "Row Not Found" if _get_internal(row).nil?
Need to improve delete tests in table_tests.rb.
