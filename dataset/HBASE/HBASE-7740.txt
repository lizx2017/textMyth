Summary:
Recheck matching row for joined scanners
Description:
It just occured to me that when the patch in HBASE-5416 was being modified by various people, the pre-check was changed to post-check in populateResults. Whereas before that, noting that there's a pre-check, I removed the check we do between seek and populateResult elsewhere (joined scanner path only).
I have not observed this bug, but it seems to exist.
