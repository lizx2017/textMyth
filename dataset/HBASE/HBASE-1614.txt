Summary:
single zk node buckling under small node? connections never timing out?
Description:
A few (Irfan on the list and jgray) report that a single node zk seems insufficient supporting small cluster < 20 nodes. This seems odd (though, yeah, we're recommending serious deploys must have a quorum of >= 3 zk nodes). Also, reports that all connections fill up and don't time out though job is done (on IRC). Take a look.
(Check zk stat to see if it'll dump connections)
