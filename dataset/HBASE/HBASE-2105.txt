Summary:
All appends are serialized in HLog
Description:
duiod on IRC was asking about locks on the write path so I reviewed it a bit and saw that we are very good at not locking except on row level in HRegion and others but in HLog we actually synchronize everything on updateLock. I'm pretty sure that's not what we want. I guess a RWLock would be more useful.
