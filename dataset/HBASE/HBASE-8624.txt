Summary:
bin/local-{master-backup|regionservers}.sh doesn't take --config arg
Description:
I needed backup masters because the chaos monkey keeps killing them.
I tried bin/local-master-backup.sh because has nice doc in refguide.
My conf is elsewhere than default and new master just crashes out if I pass --config.
