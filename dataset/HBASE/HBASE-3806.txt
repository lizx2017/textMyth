Summary:
distributed log splitting double escapes task names
Description:
During startup master double-escapes the (log split) task names when submitting them ... I had missed this in my testing because I was using task names like foo and bar instead of those that need escaping - like hdfs://... Also at startup even though the master fails to acquire the orphan tasks ... the tasks are acquired anyways when master sees the logs that need splitting.
