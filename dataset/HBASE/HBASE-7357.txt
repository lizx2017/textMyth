Summary:
HBaseClient and HBaseServer should use hbase.security.authentication when negotiating authentication
Description:
This came up in the context of testing HBASE-6788. Currently HBaseClient and HBaseServer call UserGroupInformation.isSecurityEnabled() when determining whether or not to use SASL to negotiate connections. This means they are using the hadoop.security.authentication configuration value. Since this is in the context of HBase RPC connections, it seems more correct to use the hbase.security.authentication configuration value by calling User.isHBaseSecurityEnabled().
