Summary:
Fix 'revoke' shell command
Description:
The 'revoke' shell command needs to be reworked for the AccessControlProtocol implementation that was finalized for 0.92. The permissions being removed must exactly match what was previously granted. No wildcard matching is done server side.
Allow two forms of the command in the shell for convenience:
Revocation of a specific grant:
revoke <user>, <table>, <column family> [ , <column_qualifier> ]
Have the shell automatically do so for all permissions on a table for a given user:
revoke <user>, <table>
