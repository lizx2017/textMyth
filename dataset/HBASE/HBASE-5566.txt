Summary:
[89-fb] Region server can get stuck in getMaster on master failover
Description:
This is specific to the 89-fb master. We have a retry loop in HRegionServer.getMaster where we do not read the location of the master from ZK, so a region server can get stuck there on master failover. We need to add a unit test to reliably catch this, and fix the bug.
