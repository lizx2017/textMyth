Summary:
hbase trunk should check dfs.support.append and use append() to recovery logfiles (as in branch)
Description:
this is a backport of the feature in the hlog recovery where we call fs.append(logfile); then fs.close() to recover a logfile in a situation where we run with HDFS-200 (ie: dfs.support.append = true)
