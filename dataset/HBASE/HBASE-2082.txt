Summary:
TableInputFormat is ignoring input scan's stop row setting
Description:
In the getSplits() function of TableInputFormatBase, there is a line to compare the region's stop key and the given scan's stop key.
If the region's stop key is smaller, then use the region's stop key instead of the one given by user.
But the last region will not have a stop key, so comparing a null key to the given stop key is always smaller, and the user's stop key is simply ignored.
