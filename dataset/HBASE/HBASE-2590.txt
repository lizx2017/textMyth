Summary:
Failed parse of branch element in saveVersion.sh
Description:
A mvn build would fail because of the string it was getting back from svn:
      [exec] not part of the command.
      Execute:Java13CommandLauncher: Executing 'sh' with arguments:
       '/home/X/Y/hadoop/branches/V.V/hbase/hbase-trunk/src/saveVersion.sh'
        '0.21.0-SNAPSHOT'
         '/home/X/Y/hadoop/branches/V.V/hbase-trunk/target/generated-sources'
        The ' characters around the executable and arguments are
         not part of the command.
         [exec] sed: -e expression #6, char 48: unterminated `s' command
         [exec] Result: 1
Path amended in the above to protect the innocent.
The failure was around parse of branch. Branch is not used.
