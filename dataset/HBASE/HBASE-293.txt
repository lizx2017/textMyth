Summary:
[hbaseshell] output formatting
Description:
hbaseshell currently outputs results using an ascii table.
This issue is about the hbaseshell offering a number of output formats beyond plain ascii table. It would be grand if output formatting was pluggable so folks could add new ones as they saw fit.
Currently, there is a painful need for unadorned output so folks can do a 'select page:content from webrepository where row="http://apache.com/index.html"; and they get back the page content only. Other output formats might be: csv, xml, or (x)html
Other related things to consider, but probably not as part of this issue, is that if we output xml, then we should probably have a sympathetic input parser for xml files (similar for csv). Let this issue just be about formatting (another issue can be done to add pluggable input parsers). Where the output lands should also be done in another issue: i.e. dependent on the command, output probably default to stdout but folks should be able to designate an output file (and target filesystem) as in hdfs://master.hdfsnode.com:8990/output/dump.txt or file:///tmp/dump.txt or s3://...., etc.
This issue is an outgrowth of HADOOP-1720
