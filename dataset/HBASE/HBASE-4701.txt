Summary:
TestMasterObserver fails up on jenkins
Description:
This fails for various reasons from not being able to find the region we're to move in master list of regions to fails because of 'too many open files' (I believe Giri has fixed this on some of the hadoop nodes but looks like not all).
Here is a refactor around the move w/ asserts, more logging, use of updated apis, and with check that what we're moving has a server.
