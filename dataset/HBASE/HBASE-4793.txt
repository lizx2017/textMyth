Summary:
HBase shell still using deprecated methods removed in HBASE-4436
Description:
The patch applied in HBASE-4622 (subtask of HBASE-4436) to remove deprecated methods seems to have missed some usage of those methods by the HBase shell. At least src/main/ruby/hbase/admin.rb is still using some of the removed methods, breaking some shell commands:
hbase(main):007:0> alter 'privatetable', { NAME => 'f1', VERSIONS => 2}

ERROR: wrong number of arguments (3 for 2)

This trace translates to the line:
  @admin.modifyColumn(table_name, column_name, descriptor)
which is calling one of the removed methods.
