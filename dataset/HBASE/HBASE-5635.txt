Summary:
If getTaskList() returns null, splitlogWorker would go down and it won't serve any requests
Description:
During the hlog split operation if all the zookeepers are down ,then the paths will be returned as null and the splitworker thread wil be exited
Now this regionserver wil not be able to acquire any other tasks since the splitworker thread is exited
Please find the attached code for more details
private List<String> getTaskList() {
    for (int i = 0; i < zkretries; i++) {
      try {
        return (ZKUtil.listChildrenAndWatchForNewChildren(this.watcher,
            this.watcher.splitLogZNode));
      } catch (KeeperException e) {
        LOG.warn("Could not get children of znode " +
            this.watcher.splitLogZNode, e);
        try {
          Thread.sleep(1000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e1) {
          LOG.warn("Interrupted while trying to get task list ...", e1);
          Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
          return null;
        }
      }
