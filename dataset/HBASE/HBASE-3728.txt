Summary:
NPE in HTablePool.closeTablePool
Description:
When I use HTablePool and try to close it on application shutdown I've got NPE calling closeTablePool method because I didn't borrow any tables with the given name. Could you please add a null check for queue in closeTablePool or add ability to get all table names used in a pool or just add a destroy method to close all existed table in a pool.
