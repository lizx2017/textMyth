Summary:
Split reports incorrect elapsed time
Description:
Split reports incorrect elapsed time. That is because the start time for the split is never set. (It used to be set in closing()).
Additionally, since CompactSplitThread doesn't do anything in closing or closed anymore, why keep them around?
We can just pass null for the RegionUnavailableListener and can then remove closing and closed from CompactSplitThread.
In fact, it turns out that RegionUnavailableListener is not used anywhere anymore so it should just be removed altogether.
