Summary:
Fixup of "missing" daughters on split is too aggressive
Description:
There is a bug in how we check for whether the daughters mentioned in parent region are present in .META. The check is done when we are processing a server shutdown. We're making the mistake of checking for presence of the daughter in the list of regions that used to live on the crashed server BUT fact of the matter is is that the daughter could just as well be rebalanced to another server.
The upshot is that we are inserting into .META. and trying to assign regions that are already assigned.
