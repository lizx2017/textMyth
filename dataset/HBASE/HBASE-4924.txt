Summary:
More issues running hbase on hadoop 0.23
Description:
From Roman:
>  3. This is a little bit more sinister and it is not clear what
>  the resolution path here is. When compiled against .23
>  the MiniMRCluster dependency latches onto artifact
>  hadoop-mapreduce/test. There are 2 problems with that:
>    1. this works only accidentally (but as long as it does
>    may be it is fine) since we don't have an explicit
>    dependency on hadoop-mapreduce test artifact (nor
>    should we, I think!).

>    2. MiniMRCluster from there is soon to be deprecated
>    (MAPREDUCE-3169) ans HBaseTestingUtility should
>    really transition onto using MiniMRClientClusterFactory
>    to get a MiniMRCluster.
I think there already an issue for #2 above (courtesy of Andrew IIRC). We should fix #1 too.
