Summary:
Infinite loop for secondary master
Description:
There seems be a bug that the secondary master didn't come out when the primary master dead.
Because the secondary master will be in a loop forever to watch a local variable before setting a zk watcher.
However this local variable is changed by the zk call back function.
So the secondary master will be in the infinite loop forever.
