Summary:
[javadoc] Add javadoc to Delete explaining behavior when no timestamp provided
Description:
If delete family or delete row and no timestamp, we add a delete of 'now'. When delete of explicit cell, we add a delete of the most recent. Add this fact to the Delete javadoc. I was just stumped by this differing behavior.
