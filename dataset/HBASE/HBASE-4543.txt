Summary:
major_compact '.META.' has no effect
Description:
major_compact '.META.' has no effect, although major_compact 'any_other_table' works fine from the shell.
This issue seems to only affect 0.89. The apache-trunk seems to handle this case properly.
The issue is that getTableRegions() in HMaster.java only works if the tableName given is a "normal" table.
The methodology (using a MetaScanner to look through the .META. table for the tableName) does not work if
the tableName is .META.
The fix modifies getTableRegions() to check if the tableName is .META.; and if so, handle it accordingly.
