Summary:
Release source tarball should contain ./dev-support contents.
Description:
I noticed that the release tarball for 0.95.2 doesn't contain the ./dev-support dir. In future releases, that directory (and any other supplemental dirs with useful tools) should be contained in the release src tarball.
