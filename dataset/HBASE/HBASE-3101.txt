Summary:
bin assembly doesn't include -tests or -source jars
Description:
Currently the bin assembly tries to include the hbase-VERSION-tests.jar but there's a typo "test" instead of "tests" in the assembly descriptor, so it doesn't do so. Also, I think we should probably ship the -sources jar even in the -bin assembly - it's useful for people to point their IDE at it to get API javadocs, etc.
