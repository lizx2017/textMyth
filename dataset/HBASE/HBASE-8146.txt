Summary:
IntegrationTestBigLinkedList does not work on distributed setup
Description:
Two issues:
IntegrationTestBigLinkedList.java does not add dependency jars, for it's first job (my bad for not testing it properly)
TableMapReduceUtil does not add guava, and htrace dependency to the job classpath. This affects all mapreduce jobs in trunk.
I have to look into whether the patch for HBASE-8140 would fix the second condition.
