Summary:
when region has been OPENING for too long, the master should not reassign region
Description:
When the region server R1 and data node D1 running in the same machine and let's assuem this machine pub into repair,
the master will try to reassign all the regions in the region server to other region server R2. But at that time, the name node hasn't figure out the bad data node D1.
So the region server R2 will try to open the region from the D1, which will failed and retried. Then the master believes it took TOO LONG to open this region, so it reassign to R3...
The story continues until the name node figure out the bad datanode D1 and finally region server Rn opens the region and do the compaction for the store file.
All previous region servers cannot the region later and find the file doesn't exist since it has been compacted.
So the solution is that when region has been OPENING for too long, the master should not reassign region.
