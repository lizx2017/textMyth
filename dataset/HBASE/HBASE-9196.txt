Summary:
Remove dead code related to KeyValue
Description:
While working on HBASE-9164, I found some deprecated and dead code.
1) two volatiles variables were in the critical path for comparators. (ignoreTimetamps and ignoreTypes). Removed them.
2) Replaced references to deprected #getMemstoreTs with #getMvccVersion
3) Removed ROOT_KEY_COMPARATOR and references.
