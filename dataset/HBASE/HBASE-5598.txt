Summary:
Analyse and fix the findbugs reporting by QA and add invalid bugs into findbugs-excludeFilter file
Description:
There are many findbugs errors reporting by HbaseQA. HBASE-5597 is going to up the OK count.
This may lead to other issues when we re-factor the code, if we induce new valid ones and remove invalid bugs also can not be reported by QA.
So, I would propose to add the exclude filter file for findbugs(for the invalid bugs). If we find any valid ones, we can fix under this JIRA.
