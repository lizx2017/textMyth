Summary:
dns.interface property causes malformed parsing for 'lo'
Description:
I have a seed application that is executed via maven and runs a
single JVM ApplicationStarter that starts up hdfs, regionserver, hmaster
threads. It does some seeding then shuts those down in reverse order.
So this isn't a typical way of running hbase to be sure. However it has
always worked until I upgraded to HBase 0.90.0.
I didn't notice it when I was originally testing 0.90.0 because it only
seems to be happening on our EC2.small build server node when I run this
particular seeder.
Running the same thing locally on my mac works.
Attached is the error output starting from when the HRegionServer.stop() is
called to when HMaster.shutdown() is called and it starts looping forever in
letRegionServersShutdown().
It looks like RegionServerTracker is getting to "RegionServer ephemeral node
deleted, processing expiration" but then because it can't get the
HServerInfo it doesn't follow-through with actually expiring it.
The reason it can't get the HServerInfo is because it is looking for "localhost." instead of "localhost".
My /etc/hosts file was vanilla. But when I removed the following form hbase-site.xml:
<property>
<name>hbase.master.dns.interface</name>
<value>lo</value>
</property>
<property>
<name>hbase.regionserver.dns.interface</name>
<value>lo</value>
</property>
The issue went away.
So something about the "lo" interface isn't getting parsed right on that particular machine (An EC2 M.small running Ubuntu 9).
