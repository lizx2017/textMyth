Summary:
Thrift2 can not parse values when using framed transport
Description:
ThriftHBaseServiceHandler.java use .array() on table names , and values (family , qualifier in checkandDelete , etc) which resulted in incorrect values with framed transport. Replacing .array() with getBytes() fixed this problem. I've attached the patch
EDIT: updated the patch to cover checkAndPut(), checkAndDelete()
UPDATE: updated the patch to use byteBufferToByteArray() instead of getBytes() , also removed unused imports.
