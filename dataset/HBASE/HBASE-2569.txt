Summary:
Improper error handling in face of version mismatch between the client and the server
Description:
I use trunk, and every once in a while, when I upgrade my test instance of HBase, my clients end up in a seemingly endless loop when instantiating an HTable instance:
10/05/18 23:42:46 DEBUG zookeeper.ZooKeeperWrapper: Read ZNode /hbase/root-region-server got 192.168.0.7:61322
10/05/18 23:42:47 DEBUG client.HConnectionManager$TableServers: Root region location changed. Sleeping.
10/05/18 23:42:48 DEBUG client.HConnectionManager$TableServers: Wake. Retry finding root region.
I'm pretty certain that the code throws an appropriate exception to complain about the version mismatch but it must be getting eaten somewhere and the code probably applies the usual retry logic instead of throwing up its hands in the air and immediately giving up, as I think it should.
