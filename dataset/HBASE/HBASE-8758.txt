Summary:
Error in RegionCoprocessorHost class preScanner method documentation.
Description:
preScannerOpen() method of RegionCoprocessorHost class is documented to return 'false' value in negative case (default operation should not be bypassed). Actual implementation returns 'null' value.
Proposed solution is just to correct comment to match existing implementation.
