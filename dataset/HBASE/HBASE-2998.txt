Summary:
rolling-restart.sh shouldn't rely on zoo.cfg
Description:
I tried the rolling-restart script on our dev environment, which is configured with zoo.cfg for zookeeper, and it worked pretty well. Then I tried it on our MR cluster, which doesn't have a zoo.cfg, and we suffered some downtime (no biggie tho, nothing critical was running). When the script calls this line:
bin/hbase zkcli stat $zmaster
It directly runs a ZooKeeperMain which isn't modified to read from the HBase configuration files. What happens next if ZK isn't running on the master node is that it receives a ConnectionRefused, ignores it, procedes to restart the master (which waits on the znode), and the starts restarting the region servers. They can't shutdown properly under 60 seconds, since they need a master, so they get killed. What follows is pretty ugly and pretty much requires a whole restart.
