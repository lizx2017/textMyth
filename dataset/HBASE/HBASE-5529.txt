Summary:
MR test failures becuase MALLOC_ARENA_MAX is not set
Description:
When running unit tests on CentOS 6 I get a bunch of unit test failures in mapreduce-related tests due to:
2012-03-03 00:14:18,776 WARN [Container Monitor]
monitor.ContainersMonitorImpl$MonitoringThread(436): Container

running beyond virtual memory limits. Current usage: 223.1mb of 2.0gb
