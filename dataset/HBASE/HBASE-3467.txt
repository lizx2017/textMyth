Summary:
Get doesn't find values with negative timestamps
Description:
Timestamps are allowed to be negative values, since they're stored as type long. However, using the Get object to search for versions by setting setMaxVersions() misses them.
I'm not sure where this code lives, but my suspicion is that the code which scans for matching value timestamps has a min value of 0 when it should be using java.lang.Long.MIN_VALUE.
