Summary:
server side scanner doesn't honor stop row
Description:
I have a large table. If I create a scanner with a stop row near the beginning of the table, the last hasNext call hangs for a while. If I do the same with the stop row near the end of the table, the last hasNext call is pretty quick.
I suspect that the server side scanner isn't terminating early, and is actually scanning through the whole table returning nothing.
