Summary:
minor doc update about DEFAULT_ACCEPTABLE_FACTOR
Description:
Per trunk code, in LruBlockCache.java:
static final float DEFAULT_ACCEPTABLE_FACTOR = 0.99f;
but the site doc still :
"number of region servers * heap size * hfile.block.cache.size * 0.85"
seems the HBASE-6312 forgot to update this doc
