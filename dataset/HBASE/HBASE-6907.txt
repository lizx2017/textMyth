Summary:
KeyValue equals and compareTo methods should match
Description:
KeyValue.KVComparator includes the memstoreTS when comparing, however the KeyValue.equals() method ignores the memstoreTS.
The Comparator interface has always specified that comparator return 0 when equals would return true and vice versa. Obeying that rule has been sort of optional in the past, but Java 7 introduces a new default collection sorting algorithm called Tim Sort which relies on that behavior. http://bugs.sun.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=6804124
Possible problem spots:
there's a Collections.sort(KeyValues) in RedundantKVGenerator.generateTestKeyValues(..)
TestColumnSeeking compares two collections of KeyValues using the containsAll method. It is intentionally ignoring memstoreTS, so will need an alternative method for comparing the two collections.
