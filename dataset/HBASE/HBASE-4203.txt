Summary:
While master restarts and if the META region's state is OPENING then master cannot assign META until timeout monitor deducts
Description:
1. Start Master and 2 RS.
2. If any exception happens while opening the META region the state in znode will be OPENING.
3. If at this point the master restarts then the master will start processing the regions in RIT.
4. If the znode is found to be in OPENING then master waits for timeout monitor to deduct and then call opening.
5. If default timeout monitor is configured(1800000 sec/30 min) then it will take 30 mins to open the META region itself.
Soln:
====
Better not to wait for the Timeout monitor period to open catalog tables on Master restart
