Summary:
[hbase] TestCompaction assertions fail on some hosts
Description:
Changes to TestCompaction introduced in hadoop-1768 passed an hudson build (#722) but reports on the hadoop irc have them failing on an an hp+ubuntu box:
cutting> it's nothing fancy. /proc/cpuinfo shows "Intel(R) Pentium(R) 4 CPU 3.20GHz".
<buenaventura> Thats single-cpu...
<cutting> yep
<cutting> 1GB of ram. bog standard pc.
<cutting> running java 5, not java 6, if that matters.
(Failed also w/ java6).
The assertion that fails is count of row versions after a compaction and flush. There are usually 4 – the 3 from stores and one that is in a flush that happened 'concurrent' to the compaction – but there can be 3 only (the maximum for a column) if non-intuitively the compaction thread starts after the flush finishes which can happen with certain jvm schedulers (hudson is one such).
I commented out the assertions to get the build working again. This issue is about adding them back in again in a manner that has them working on hudson and the bog-standard hp+ubuntu.
