Summary:
Use primitives -- long, byte [] -- in place of Long, BytesWritable, etc.
Description:
Profiling, bulk of allocations are short-lived object wrapping of primitives. Examples include:
+ HADOOP-1483 'Use long primitives creating, renewing, and cancelling leases' now subsumed by this issue.
+ Published APIs for region server, master and clients return ByteWritables or arrays of ByteWritables when could be returning byte [] or byte [][].
