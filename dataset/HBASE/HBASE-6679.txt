Summary:
RegionServer aborts due to race between compaction and split
Description:
In our nightlies, we have seen RS aborts due to compaction and split racing. Original parent file gets deleted after the compaction, and hence, the daughters don't find the parent data file. The RS kills itself when this happens. Will attach a snippet of the relevant RS logs.
