Summary:
[89-fb] Fix per-store metrics aggregation
Description:
In r1182034 per-Store metrics were broken, because the aggregation of StoreFile metrics over all stores in a region was replaced by overriding them every time. We saw these metrics drop by a factor of numRegions on a production cluster â€“ thanks to Kannan for noticing this! We need to fix the metrics and add a unit test to ensure regressions like this don't happen in the future.
