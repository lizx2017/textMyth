Summary:
RegionSplitter Should Allow NSFRE during logical split verification
Description:
When verifying that a split request has been logically completed, the client can throw a NoServerForRegionException if the parent & daughter regions are in flux at this time. We should catch that error and retry later when the daughter regions should have been brought online.
