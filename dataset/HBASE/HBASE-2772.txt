Summary:
Scan doesn't recover from region server failure
Description:
Very simple, if the region server you are scanning from dies for any reason, your scanner will die too because it will not try to get a new lease and will reuse the same id.
It doesn't happen to region that moves because we keep them opened until the scanner is closed.
It could be affecting branch, I'm just not sure yet.
I found this issue with TestReplication from HBASE-2223.
