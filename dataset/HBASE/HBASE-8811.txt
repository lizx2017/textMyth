Summary:
REST service ignores misspelled "check=" parameter, causing unexpected mutations
Description:
In rest.RowResource.update(), this code keeps executing a request if a misspelled check= parameter is provided.
    if (CHECK_PUT.equalsIgnoreCase(check)) {
      return checkAndPut(model);
    } else if (CHECK_DELETE.equalsIgnoreCase(check)) {
      return checkAndDelete(model);
    } else if (check != null && check.length() > 0) {
      LOG.warn("Unknown check value: " + check + ", ignored");
    }
By my reading of the code, this results in the provided cell value that was intended as a check instead being treated as a mutation, which is sure to destroy user data. Thus the priority of this bug, as it can cause corruption.
I suggest that a better reaction than a warning would be, approximately:
return Response.status(Response.Status.BAD_REQUEST)
        .type(MIMETYPE_TEXT).entity("Invalid check value '" + check + "'")
        .build();
