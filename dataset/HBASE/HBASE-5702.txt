Summary:
MasterSchemaChangeTracker.excludeRegionServerForSchemaChanges leaks a MonitoredTask per call
Description:
This bug is so easy to reproduce I'm wondering why it hasn't been reported yet. Stop any number of region servers on a 0.94/6 cluster and you'll see in the master interface one task per stopped region server saying the following:
Processing schema change exclusion for region server = sv4r27s44,62023,1333402175340 RUNNING (since 5sec ago) No schema change in progress. Skipping exclusion for server = sv4r27s44,62023,1333402175340 (since 5sec ago)
It's gonna stay there until the master cleans it:
WARN org.apache.hadoop.hbase.monitoring.TaskMonitor: Status Processing schema change exclusion for region server = sv4r27s44,62023,1333402175340: status=No schema change in progress. Skipping exclusion for server = sv4r27s44,62023,1333402175340, state=RUNNING, startTime=1333404636419, completionTime=-1 appears to have been leaked
It's not clear to me why it's using a MonitoredTask in the first place.
