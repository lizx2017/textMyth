Summary:
handle overly large column family in one row
Description:
From a team in TM:
I tried to create the large column in one row and one family. The value of each column has only 10 bytes. When I created the 804226850th column, the region server was crashed. I find that all columns of one row and one family will in the same region. The region server will crash, because this region is too large. And then I want to reboot HBase, after several minutes, the region servers will crash one by one.
If one row and one family cannot split, then no matter how many machines are in HBase system, the capacity of HBase will be limited by one machine. I want to know whether this problem is a bug. If the column quantity in one row and one family is limited, can you tell me the safe range?
Currently a row cannot be split. So an individual row can expand only to some finite limit constrained by the region server capability.
I am impressed that a row was able to successfully contain 804,226,849 columns.
The HBase storage capability goals are currently "billions of rows, millions of columns, thousands of tables". A test involving hundreds of millions of columns is very challenging.
Most important, HBase should not accept input beyond some limit which produces a cascading failure.
I think we also do want to have the architectural discussion about rows that must span region servers due to immensity.
