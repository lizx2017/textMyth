Summary:
Reuse compression streams in HFileBlock.Writer
Description:
We need to to reuse compression streams in HFileBlock.Writer instead of allocating them every time. The motivation is that when using Java's built-in implementation of Gzip, we allocate a new GZIPOutputStream object and an associated native data structure every time we create a compression stream. The native data structure is only deallocated in the finalizer. This is one suspected cause of recent TestHFileBlock failures on Hadoop QA: https://builds.apache.org/job/HBase-TRUNK/2658/testReport/org.apache.hadoop.hbase.io.hfile/TestHFileBlock/testPreviousOffset_1_/.
