Summary:
the hbase-default entry of "hbase.defaults.for.version" causes tests not to run via not-maven
Description:
using the default setup of a maven project for intellij, tests fail because the hbase-default.xml contains a token @@@VERSION@@@. The maven build creates a substitute file, but this file isn't by default on the classpath.
Is there a different place to put the hbase-default.xml file than target/classes? That is excluded from the classpath because IJ has it's own compiler. Including that path in the project classpath seems dangerous.
Can we get the output to go to just 'target' or 'target/generated-sources/org' perhaps?
