Summary:
If a FS bootstrap, need to also ensure ZK is cleaned
Description:
In a test environment where a cycle of start, operation, kill hbase (repeat), noticed that we were doing a bootstrap on startup but then we were picking up the previous cycles zk state. It made for a mess in the test.
Last thing seen on previous cycle was:
2011-03-11 06:33:36,708 DEBUG org.apache.hadoop.hbase.master.AssignmentManager: Handling transition=RS_ZK_REGION_OPENING, server=X.X.X.60020,1299853933073, region=1028785192/.META.
Then, in the messed up cycle I saw:
2011-03-11 06:42:48,530 INFO org.apache.hadoop.hbase.master.MasterFileSystem: BOOTSTRAP: creating ROOT and first META regions
.....
Then after setting watcher on .META., we get a
2011-03-11 06:42:58,301 INFO org.apache.hadoop.hbase.master.AssignmentManager: Processing region .META.,,1.1028785192 in state RS_ZK_REGION_OPENED
2011-03-11 06:42:58,302 WARN org.apache.hadoop.hbase.master.AssignmentManager: Region in transition 1028785192 references a server no longer up X.X.X; letting RIT timeout so will be assigned elsewhere
We're all confused.
Should at least clear our zk if a bootstrap happened.
