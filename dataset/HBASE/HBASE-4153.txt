Summary:
Handle RegionAlreadyInTransitionException in AssignmentManager
Description:
Comment from Stack over in HBASE-3741:
Question: Looking at this patch again, if we throw a RegionAlreadyInTransitionException, won't we just assign the region elsewhere though RegionAlreadyInTransitionException in at least one case here is saying that the region is already open on this regionserver?
Indeed looking at the code it's going to be handled the same way other exceptions are. Need to add special cases for assign and unassign.
