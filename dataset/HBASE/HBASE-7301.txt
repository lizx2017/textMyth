Summary:
Force ipv4 for unit tests
Description:
These two tests are failing when I run them locally:
Failed tests: testMultiSlaveReplication(org.apache.hadoop.hbase.replication.TestMultiSlaveReplication): Waited too much time for put replication
testCyclicReplication(org.apache.hadoop.hbase.replication.TestMasterReplication): Waited too much time for put replication
testSimplePutDelete(org.apache.hadoop.hbase.replication.TestMasterReplication): Waited too much time for put replication
The TestMasterReplication is NPE'ing
Mighty JD said he'd take a looksee.
