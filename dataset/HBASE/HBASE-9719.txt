Summary:
Premptive Call Me Maybe HBase
Description:
Aphyr wrote an interesting article on C* [1]. Some awkward-looking issues were turned up though it seems the author is purportedly doing nothing but exercising the software within spec; he is just paying close attention to what is being returned.
It does not look like Aphyr will be coming our way any time soon [2] – thanks Ian Varley – but he could change his mind. Wouldn't it be coolio if we'd already run his test suite and found any bugs and fixed them before he came by? This issue is about running his article against hbase so we find the embarrassing before he does.
