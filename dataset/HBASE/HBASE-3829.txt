Summary:
TestMasterFailover failures in jenkins
Description:
We'll fail the TestMasterFailover tests on occasion up on jenkins. One reason for the 180000 timeouts it that test completed but a regionserver won't go down because its stuck over in getMaster. Looking into it, we have all these loops in the regionserver; we have the main run loop but then there are loops trying to send regionserver reportForDuty and then over in the regionserver report method. In a recent fail up on jenkins we were stuck in one of these outer loops trying to get master.
This patch removes a bunch of the outer loops instead having the outer loops run around the HRegionServer#run loop.
