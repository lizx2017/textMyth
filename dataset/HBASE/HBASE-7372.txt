Summary:
Check in the generated website so can point apache infrastructure at what to publish as our hbase.apache.org
Description:
January 1st is deadline for changing how we publish our website. We may no longer rsync out to people.apache.org. Apache infrastructure supplies two options here: http://www.apache.org/dev/project-site.html We could redo our site in apache cms format. Or we could just use svnpubsub and keep on w/ how the site is currently generated and on checkin, have it autopublished. I'll go the latter route unless I hear otherwise.
For svnpubsub, we need to point apache infrastructure at a directory that has our checkedin site in it. I was thinking ${hbasedir}/hbase.apache.org
Let me raise this on the dev list too.
