Summary:
hbase doesn't size memcache correctly under -XX:+UseG1GC
Description:
I get this in the logfile:
2009-04-16 23:49:20,518 INFO org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.MemcacheFlusher: Forced flushing of <table redacted>,1239954535262 because global memcache limit of 3.2m exceeded; currently 3.2m and flushing till 2.0m
With the experimental G1 GC, the heap size is created differently, and the way we calculate the size of memcache is flawed under this GC. This affects performance and makes things reallll slow.
