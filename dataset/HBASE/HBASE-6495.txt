Summary:
HBaseAdmin shouldn't expect HConnection to be an HConnectionImplementation
Description:
Currently, the HBaseAdmin has a constructor that takes an HConnection, but then immediately casts it to an HConnectionManager.HConnectionImplementation:
  public HBaseAdmin(HConnection connection)
      throws MasterNotRunningException, ZooKeeperConnectionException {
    this.conf = connection.getConfiguration();

    // We want the real class, without showing it our public interface,
    //  hence the cast.
    this.connection = (HConnectionManager.HConnectionImplementation)connection;
However, this breaks the explicit contract in the javadocs and makes it basically impossible to mock out the hbaseadmin.
We need to either make the hbaseadmin use a basic HConnection and optimize for cases where its smarter or bring up the couple of methods in HConnectionManager.HConnectionImplementation to the HConnection interface.
