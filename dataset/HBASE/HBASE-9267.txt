Summary:
StochasticLoadBalancer goes over its processing time limit
Description:
I trying out 0.95.2, I left it running over the weekend (8 RS, average load between 12 and 3 regions) and right now the balancer runs for 12 mins:
2013-08-19 21:54:45,534 DEBUG [jdec2hbase0403-1.vpc.cloudera.com,60000,1376689696384-BalancerChore] org.apache.hadoop.hbase.master.balancer.StochasticLoadBalancer: Could not find a better load balance plan. Tried 0 different configurations in 777309ms, and did not find anything with a computed cost less than 36.32576937689094
It seems it slowly crept up there, yesterday it was doing:

Tried 0 different configurations in 257374ms, and did not find anything with a computed cost less than 36.3251082542424
And originally it was doing 1 minute.
In the jstack I see a 1000 of these and jstack doesn't want to show me the whole thing:
