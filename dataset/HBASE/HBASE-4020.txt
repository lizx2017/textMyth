Summary:
"testWritesWhileGetting" unit test needs to be fixed.
Description:
The unit test "testWritesWhileGetting" in the org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.TestHRegion test needs to be corrected. It is current using the table name and method name for initializing a HRegion as "testWritesWhileScanning". It should be "testWritesWhileGetting".
Due to this, the test fails as the "initHRegion" method fails in creating a new HRegion for the test.
