Summary:
Fix scan addcolumns after hbase-1385 commit (broken hudson build)
Description:
These are broken up on hudson after 1385 went in. Looking at whats failing, seems like issues with old style vs. new style specifying column names and that our addColumn should just handle them. Did some fix up.
