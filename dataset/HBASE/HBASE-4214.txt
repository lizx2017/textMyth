Summary:
Per-region request counters should be clearer about scope
Description:
In testing trunk, I noticed that per-region request counters shown on table.jsp are lifetime-scoped, rather than per-second or some other time range. However, I'm pretty sure they reset when the region is moved. So, it's hard to use them to judge relative hotness of regions from the web UI without hooking it up to something lik OpenTSDB
