Summary:
Fix possibility of deadlock waiting on -ROOT- deploy
Description:
HBASE-3449 'Server shutdown handlers deadlocked waiting for META' describes case where we could block waiting on ROOT deploy but all of the handlers on master are occupied waiting on ROOT leaving none open to handle ROOT. HBASE-3449 workaround makes the likelihood low. This issue is about fixing it once and for all (cancel of the excecutor and requeuing or some such device).
