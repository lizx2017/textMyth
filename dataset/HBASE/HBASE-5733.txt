Summary:
AssignmentManager#processDeadServersAndRegionsInTransition can fail with NPE.
Description:
Found while going through the code...
AssignmentManager#processDeadServersAndRegionsInTransition can fail with NPE as this is directly iterating the nodes from listChildrenAndWatchForNewChildren with-out checking for null.
Here also we need to handle with null check like other places.
