Summary:
postOpen hook called twice
Description:
postOpen hook is called twice when a region is initializing:
Once at the end of the body of the initializeRegionInternals() method of the HRegion class.
Once at the end initializeRegionStores() method of the HRegion class; initializeRegionStores() is called inside initializeRegionInternals() and as such causes the postOpen hook to be called twice.
