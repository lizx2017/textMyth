Summary:
Shell "close_region" reveals a Master<>HRS problem, regions are not reassigned
Description:
When issuing a "close_region" on the shell the Master logs these entries:
...
2009-06-09 22:11:31,141 DEBUG org.apache.hadoop.hbase.master.RegionManager: Applying operation in tasklists to region
2009-06-09 22:11:33,557 DEBUG org.apache.hadoop.hbase.master.HMaster: Attempting to close region: TestTable,0000291328,1244572849139
2009-06-09 22:11:33,560 INFO org.apache.hadoop.hbase.master.HMaster: Marking TestTable,0000291328,1244572849139 as closed on 192.168.2.103:63745; cleaning SERVER + STARTCODE; master will tell regionserver to close region on next heartbeat
2009-06-09 22:11:34,156 DEBUG org.apache.hadoop.hbase.master.RegionManager: Applying operation in tasklists to region
...
But that is it, no further processing is done. The regions stays closed, and even across a restart it stays closed.
According to what I got told the region should be automatically reassigned to a new server. Please confirm that this is what is expected. If not and the above seems right, then please disregard and close issue.
