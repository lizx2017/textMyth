Summary:
Mapping a very big table kills region servers
Description:
Currently TableInputFormat doesn't change the block caching behavior of scans and one of our table grew so big that using the defaults we kill a least one region server per job run (because of GCs even if we have a heap of 7GB). This doesn't scale well, we should set it by default to false.
