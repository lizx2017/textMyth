Summary:
HBCK check for lingering split parents should check for child regions
Description:
HBCK checks for split parent regions being in meta and hdfs, and reports this as a transient error.
However, split parents, by design, linger around for some time, until its children stops referring to it.
Instead we should check whether the children are there, and do not report anything if it is so.
