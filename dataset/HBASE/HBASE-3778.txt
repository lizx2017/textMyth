Summary:
HBaseAdmin.create doesn't create empty boundary keys
Description:
In my ycsb stuff, I have code that looks like this:
    String startKey = "user1020000000";
    String endKey = "user940000000";
    admin.createTable(descriptor, startKey.getBytes(), endKey.getBytes(), regions);
The result, however, is a table where the first and last region has defined first and last keys rather than empty keys.
The patch I am about to attach fixes this, I think. I have some worries about other uses of Bytes.split, however, and would like some eyes on this patch. Perhaps we need a new dialect of split.
