Summary:
data lost with gora continuous ingest test (goraci)
Description:
Keith Turner re-wrote the accumulo continuous ingest test using gora, which has both hbase and accumulo back-ends.
I put a billion entries into HBase, and ran the Verify map/reduce job. The verification failed because about 21K entries were missing. The goraci README explains the test, and how it detects missing data.
I re-ran the test with 100 million entries, and it verified successfully.
Both of the times I tested using a billion entries, the verification failed.
If I run the verification step twice, the results are consistent, so the problem is
probably not on the verify step.
Here's the versions of the various packages:
package version
hadoop 0.20.205.0
hbase 0.92.1
gora http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/gora/trunk r1311277
goraci https://github.com/ericnewton/goraci tagged 2012-04-08
The change I made to goraci was to configure it for hbase and to allow it to build properly.
