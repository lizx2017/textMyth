Summary:
Restore some API mistakenly removed in client, mapred*, and common
Description:
Here is contrib to the API compatibility story. I went over Aleks' compatibility report and restored removed or overriden methods and constructors, stuff that was in 0.94 non-deprecated and removed in 0.96.
This patch is not comprehensive because some removals cannot be restored as in those that used take Writables (more on this later from Jon).
The changes included here are mostly restore of methods that took a table name as a byte array replaced by a TableName object.
