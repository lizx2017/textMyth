Summary:
The WhileMatchFilter doesn't delegate the call to filterRow()
Description:
While testing the recent MemStoreScanner slowness I noticed that each scan in the randomSeekScan test takes about 19 seconds to complete. The scan in question provides a startRow and a WhileMatchFilter containing a PageFilter that asks for 120 rows. I would have expected this scan to return in roughly the same amount of time as a scan that specifies a startRow and stopRow that spans a similar number of rows.
As it turns out this is an issue with the WhileMatchFilter. The WhileMatchFilter is not delegating the call the filterRow() down the the PageFilter. As a result the PageFilter never increments the rowsAccepted counter.
