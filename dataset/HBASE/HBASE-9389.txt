Summary:
Favorednodes command line not verifying assignments correctly
Description:
In manual testing, encountered an issue to do with the command line tool (HBASE-9116) not verifying the assignments correctly. Although the regions are assigned to the favored nodes, the verification/print showed otherwise.
The command to reproduce the problem (after having created the tables, and loading some data):
bin/hbase org.apache.hadoop.hbase.master.RegionPlacementMaintainer -tables cluster_test1,cluster_test2 -hbase_root /apps/hbase/data -v
