Summary:
If we timeout PENDING_CLOSE and send another closeRegion RPC, need to handle NSRE from RS (comes as a RemoteException)
Description:
When we send a closeRegion RPC to an RS, we are catching NSRE but when the RS is the one throwing the NSRE, then it comes back as a RemoteException (then an NSRE) and we aren't unwrapping it properly.
We need to catch this and then deal with it appropriately.
Still tracking how this happened in the first place.
