Summary:
[UI] Catalog tables section isn't aligned
Description:
I attached a picture of what I got. You can see it doesn't look right.
One more thing is that the page doesn't auto-refresh when you switch tabs. For example, click Catalog tables, create a new table, click User tables, you don't see the new table. You need to refresh the page to see it.
