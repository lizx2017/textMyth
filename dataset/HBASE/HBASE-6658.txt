Summary:
Rename WritableByteArrayComparable to something not mentioning Writable
Description:
After HBASE-6477, WritableByteArrayComparable will no longer be Writable, so should be renamed.
Current idea is ByteArrayComparator (since all the derived classes are *Comparator not *Comparable), but I'm open to suggestions.
