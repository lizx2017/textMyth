Summary:
ICV puts memstore before writing WAL first -- by default; make the default be 'correct' and let better perf be optional
Description:
See this thread up on the list and Lars' note on the end: http://search-hadoop.com/m/Y6xTRp6sxq1/%2522Help+regarding+RowLock%2522&subj=Help+regarding+RowLock
I thought it was just ICV that did the memstore put first. This issue is about making it so the described behavior is optional and that the default out of the box goes for correctness â€“ i.e. write WAL first and then memstore.
