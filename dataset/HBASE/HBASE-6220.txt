PersistentMetricsTimeVaryingRate gets used for non-time-based metrics

PersistentMetricsTimeVaryingRate gets used for metrics that are not time-based, leading to confusing names such as "avg_time" for compaction size, etc. You hav to read the code in order to understand that this is actually referring to bytes, not seconds.
