Summary:
On review HBASE-2707 has problem in that we'll get stuck in the delay queue and never come out
Description:
I committed the hbase-2707 patch yesterday but on second thoughts, it has a flaw in that if nothing in the todo queue, we then poll the delayedtodo queue. If we fall into the latter and it has not elements, then we'll never come out; there are no notifyalls going on to wake us up. Patch coming.
