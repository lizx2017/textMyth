Summary:
Silent Data Offlining During HDFS Flakiness
Description:
See HBASE-1436 . The bug fix for this JIRA is a temporary workaround for improperly moving partially-written files from TMP into the region directory when a FS error occurs. Unfortunately, the fix is to ignore all IO exceptions, which masks off-lining due to FS flakiness. We need to permanently fix the problem that created HBASE-1436 & then at least have the option to not open a region during times of flakey FS.
