Summary:
OpenedRegionHandler racing with itself in ServerShutDownhandler flow leading to HMaster abort
Description:
Steps to reproduce
==================
-> Region R1 is being opened in RS1.
->After processing the znode to OPENED RS1 goes down.
->Now before the OpenedRegionHandler executor deletes the znode if ServerShutDownHandler tries to assign the region to RS2, RS2 transits the node to OPENED and this OpenedRegionHandler executor deletes the znode.
->Now if the first OpenedRegionHandler tries deleting the znode it throws NoNode Exception and causes the HMaster to abort.
