Summary:
Eliminate threadlocal from MVCC code
Description:
Brought up by Vladimir Rodionov and Ted Yu.
Currently we use ThreadLocals to communicate the current readpoint between a RegionScanner and the Store{File}Scanner's down the stack.
Since ThreadLocals are not cheap we should consider whether it is possible to pass the readpoint through the call stack instead.
