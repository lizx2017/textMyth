Summary:
HBaseConfiguration(Configuration c) constructor shouldn't overwrite passed conf with defaults
Description:
While testing out mapreduce with hbase, in the map portion of a task, the map would try to connect to an hbase master at localhost/127.0.0.1. The config passed to the hbaseconfiguration contained the necessary hbase configuration information, but I assume was being overwritten by the defaults in the config files during addResource, as commenting out addHbaseResources in the constructor fixed the symptom. I would expect the configs to be layered on top of each other, e.g. default, then site, then the config passed as a parameter.
