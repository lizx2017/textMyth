Summary:
Place to publish RegionServer information such as webuiport and coprocessors loaded
Description:
HBASE-4070 added loaded CoProcessors to HServerLoad which seems like wrong place to carry this info. We need a locus for static info of this type such as loaded CoProcessors and webuiport as well as stuff like how many cpus, RAM, etc: e.g. in regionserver znode or available on invocation of an HRegionServer method (master can ask HRegionServer when it needs it).
