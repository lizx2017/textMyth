Summary:
Stopping replication via the "stop_replication" command in hbase shell on a slave cluster isn't acknowledged in the replication sink
Description:
After running "stop_replication" in the hbase shell on our slave cluster we saw replication continue for weeks. Turns out that the replication sink is missing a check to get the replication state and therefore continued to write.
