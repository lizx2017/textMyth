Summary:
Redo MemStore heap sizing to be accurate, testable, and more like new LruBlockCache
Description:
MemStore sizing is inaccurate and does not include all overhead.
I'm going to make it look like the LruBlockCache does. Will provide a MemStore.heapSize() method that includes ALL overhead of the MemStore itself.
