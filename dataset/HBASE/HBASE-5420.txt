Summary:
TestImportTsv does not shut down MR Cluster correctly (fails against 0.23 hadoop)
Description:
Test calls startMiniMapReduceCluster() but never calls shutdownMiniMapReduceCluster().
This causes failures with -Dhadoop.profile=23 when both testMROnTable and testMROnTableWithCustomMapper are run, because the cluster cannot start up properly for the second test.
