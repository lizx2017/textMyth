Summary:
A client continues to try and connect to a powered down regionserver
Description:
Experiment-1
Started a dev cluster - META is on the same regionserver as my key-value. I kill the regionserver process but donot power down the machine.
The META is able to migrate to a new regionserver and the regions are also able to reopen elsewhere.
The client is able to talk to the META and find the new kv location and get it.
Experiment-2
Started a dev cluster - META is on a different regionserver as my key-value. I kill the regionserver process but donot power down the machine.
The META remains where it is and the regions are also able to reopen elsewhere.
The client is able to talk to the META and find the new kv location and get it.
Experiment-3
Started a dev cluster - META is on a different regionserver as my key-value. I power down the machine hosting this regionserver.
The META remains where it is and the regions are also able to reopen elsewhere.
The client is able to talk to the META and find the new kv location and get it.
Experiment-4 (This is the problematic one)
Started a dev cluster - META is on the same regionserver as my key-value. I power down the machine hosting this regionserver.
The META is able to migrate to a new regionserver - however - it takes a really long time (~30 minutes)
The regions on that regionserver DONOT reopen (I waited for 1 hour)
The client is able to find the new location of the META, however, the META keeps redirecting the client to powered down
regionserver as the location of the key-value it is trying to get. Thus the client's get is unsuccessful.
