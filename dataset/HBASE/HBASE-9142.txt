Summary:
Mutation#getFamilyMap() return type change between HBase 94 and 96 breaks downstream apps
Description:
In Hbase-94, Mutation#getFamilyMap() had signature:
public Map<byte[],List<KeyValue>> getFamilyMap()
In Hbase-96 it is:
public NavigableMap<byte[],List<? extends Cell>> getFamilyMap()
I understand this might not be an easy fix or even a possible one - but it breaks downstream apps in a nasty way. If the app needs to process the individual columns, then the whole logic is now different. Is there a way to work around this, if this cannot be fixed?
