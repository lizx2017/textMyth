Summary:
Lots of DNS queries from client
Description:
In running a YCSB workload, I managed to DDOS a DNS server since it seems to be flooding lots of DNS requests. Installing nscd on the client machines improved throughput by a factor of 6 and stopped killing the server. These are long-running clients, so it's not clear why we do so many lookups.
