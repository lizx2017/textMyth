Summary:
[0.92 UNIT TESTS] TestReplication.queueFailover occasionally fails [Part-1]
Description:
Have seen it twice in the recent past: http://bit.ly/MPCykB & http://bit.ly/O79Dq7 ..
Looking briefly at the logs hints at a pattern - in both the failed test instances, there was an RS crash while the test was running.
