Summary:
API polluted with default and protected access data members and methods
Description:
If you look at the API in javadoc, its polluted with data members and methods of protected or default access. It makes it difficult for users figuring how the API should be used. At least the user-facing classes – HTable and HBaseAdmin – need cleanup
