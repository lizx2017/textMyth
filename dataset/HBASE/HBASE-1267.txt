Summary:
binary keys broken in trunk (again).
Description:
Binary keys, specifically ones where the first byte of the key is nul '\0' don't work:
Splits happen
Logfile indicates everything normal
But the .META. doesnt list all the regions. It only lists the 'basic' regions: 'table,,1234'. The other regions with the binary keys in the middle just dont seem to be in .META....
