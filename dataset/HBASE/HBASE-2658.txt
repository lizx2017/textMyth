Summary:
REST (stargate) TableRegionModel Regions need to be updated to work w/ new region naming convention from HBASE-2531
Description:
One reason TestTableResource was failing was because comparing region names as strings was failing because the two below no longer matched. My guess is that the rest stuff is not using the new means of constructing region names. See HBASE-2531
