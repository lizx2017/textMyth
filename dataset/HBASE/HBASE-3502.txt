Summary:
Can't open region because can't open .regioninfo because AlreadyBeingCreatedException
Description:
Testing killing .META. I tripped over this one. Last thing seen on regionserver killed was:
2011-02-02 21:44:48,379 DEBUG org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.HRegion: Instantiated TestTable,0591556500,1296683085472.76c9a32c5f068d16240e42a15fed8417.
... which means we could have been inside checkRegioninfoOnFilesystem when we were killed.
This tries to create the .regioninfo file. Seems like that was started over at the NN but then the RS died shortly afterward. Its stopping the Region opening. I suppose I could try and open it for append to shut it then reopen?
