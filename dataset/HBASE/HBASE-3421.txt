Summary:
Very wide rows -- 30M plus -- cause us OOME
Description:
From the list, see 'jvm oom' in http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/hbase-user/201101.mbox/browser, it looks like wide rows – 30M or so – causes OOME during compaction. We should check it out. Can the scanner used during compactions use the 'limit' when nexting? If so, this should save our OOME'ing (or, we need to add to the next a max size rather than count of KVs).
