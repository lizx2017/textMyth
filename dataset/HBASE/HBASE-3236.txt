Description:
jdcryans suggests a page in book where we list major changes in API â€“ the deprecated stuff removed in 0.90.
Ted Yu started a list up in mailing list:
I am trying to compile our code against 0.90
Result.getCellValue() is no longer available.
Can you tell me the alternative ?
..
HConstants is final class now instead of interface
RowFilterInterface is gone
org.apache.hadoop.hbase.io.Cell is gone
org.apache.hadoop.hbase.io.RowResult is gone
constructor
HColumnDescriptor(byte[],int,java.lang.String,boolean,boolean,int,boolean)
is gone
Put.setTimeStamp() is gone
org.apache.hadoop.hbase.filter.Filter has added
getNextKeyHint(org.apache.hadoop.hbase.KeyValue)
If you know the alternative to some of the old classes, please share.
