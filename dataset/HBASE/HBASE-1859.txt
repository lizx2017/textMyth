Summary:
Misc shell fixes patch.
Description:
Miscellaneous fixes to HBase shell:
1) instantiated @formatter in hirb.rb grabs STDOUT, does not allow interactive trapping of STDOUT during shell session
2) passed script to HBase shell does not have access to HBase commands
Possible fixes:
1) Instead of explicitly passing STDOUT to Formatter constructor, can use default Kernel, which will hook into STDOUT when called.
2) Can move load of script2load to after the HBase shell methods are defined, thus giving access to these methods to the loaded script.
