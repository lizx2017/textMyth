Summary:
If a server's lease times out or the server dies, All regions will get reassigned even split or offline ones.
Description:
If a server's lease times out or a server dies (essentially the same thing), when the master tries to find the regions it was serving, it does not check to see if the region has been offlined or split.
In ProcessServerShutdown.scanMetaRegion, the code:
        } else {
          // Get region reassigned
          regions.add(info);
        }
should be:
        } else {
          if (!info.isOffline() && !info.isSplit()) {
            // Get region reassigned
            regions.add(info);
          }
        }
