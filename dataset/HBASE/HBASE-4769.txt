Summary:
Abort RegionServer Immediately on OOME
Description:
Currently, when the HRegionServer runs out of the memory, it will call master, which will cause more heap allocations and throw a second exception that it's run out of memory again. The easiest & safest way to avoid this OOME storm is to abort the RegionServer immediately when it hits the memory boundary. Part of the 89-fb to trunk port.
