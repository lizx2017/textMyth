Summary:
[hbase] Add new WhileMatchRowFilter and StopRowFilter filters
Description:
I've created two additional filters for HBase: WhileMatchRowFilter and StopRowFilter. WhileMatchRowFilter is an extension of RegExpRowFilter; it also filters rows based on whether they match a specified regex. However, unlike its parent, WhileMatchRowFilter filters everything after it's first filtered row - once a row fails to match regex or column specifications, filterAllRemaining() always returns true. This type of functionality will be useful when filtering for a set of adjacent rows that match a certain regex (as opposed to every row that matches that regex).
StopRowFilter filters out every row greater than or equal to a specified rowKey (the stopRow). The filter assumes that the rowKeys it receives are in alphabetical order, so once a key greater than the stopRow is encountered filterAllRemaining() will return true. StopRowFilter will be useful for alphabetical filtering.
Both filters come with JUnit tests, namely TestWhileMatchRowFilter and TestStopRowFilter.
