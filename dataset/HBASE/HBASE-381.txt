Summary:
[hbase] Make default configuration more responsive
Description:
Default configuration is not very first-time user friendly. Creating a table takes 30 seconds on my desktop. The bulk of the time is hbase just sitting in the sleep it does between wakes looking for work. Hbase can be made more responsive by tuning down a couple of parameters without compromizing operation on single node up to small cluster size (10s of machines).
