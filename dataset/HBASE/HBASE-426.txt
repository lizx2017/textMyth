Summary:
hbase can't find remote filesystem
Description:
If filesystem is remote, e.g. its an Hadoop DFS running "over there", there is no means of pointing hbase at it currently (unless you count copying hadoop-site.xml into hbase/conf). Should be possible to just set a fully qualified hbase.rootdir and that should be sufficient for hbase figuring the fs (needs to be backported to 0.1 too).
