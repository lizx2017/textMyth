Summary:
Native folder not available under lib folder in the HBase trunk deployment

I was trying to install Snappy. Found this link.
http://www.spaggiari.org/index.php/hbase/how-to-install-snappy-with#.US7JNzDX_D4.
As per this link there is a native folder under lib directory in the HBase installation path and it is available in 0.94.
