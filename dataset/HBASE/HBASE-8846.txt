Summary:
Revert the package name change for TableExistsException
Description:
I was going through the code changes that were needed for getting an application that was running with hbase-0.92 run with hbase-0.95.
TableExistsException's package has changed - hence, needs a code change in the application. Offline discussion with some folks led us to believe that this change can probably be reverted back.
