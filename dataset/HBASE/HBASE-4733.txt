Summary:
Rest client does not close zookeeper sessions (leaking sessions for each GET or PUT)
Description:
This will appear in the log once the zookeeper connection/session leaking will grow to 2000, zookeeper won't be able to accept any more connections causing REST RPC calls to fail, here is the log when the problem is in progress:

After the fix, the log looks much better, and we can observe zookeeper connections closing after every RPC call:
