Summary:
TestAcidGuarantees system test broken by reliance on MiniCluster
Description:
When I did HBASE-6334 and HBASE-6379, I only focused on the unit test and didn't think to test the system test as well.
The problem is that those JIRAs introduced a reliance on the miniCluster:
    // Add a flusher
    ctx.addThread(new RepeatingTestThread(ctx) {
      public void doAnAction() throws Exception {
        util.flush();
      }
    });
util.flush requires a miniCluster, so doesn't work with a system test.
