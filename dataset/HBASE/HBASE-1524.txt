Summary:
HBase[0.19.3]: TableInputFormatBase.TableRecordReader.restart() @line 110. "startRow" should be changed to "firstRow"
Description:
Version: 0.19.3
Class org.apache.hadoop.hbase.mapred.TableInputFormatBase.TableRecordReader
Method: restart()
Line: 110
Code:
"this.scanner = this.htable.getScanner(trrInputColumns, startRow,"
Suggestions:
Change startRow to firstRow.
Reasons:
1. The restart() method tries to obtain a new Scanner given by the input parameter firstRow under various conditions.
In both lines 114 and 119, firstRow are used for obtaining a Scanner. However, at line 110, startRow is used, which
should be changed to firstRow.
2. The init() method won't be affected since it calls restart(startRow) at line 129.
3. The next() method will be affected since it calls restart(lastRow) at line 215.
