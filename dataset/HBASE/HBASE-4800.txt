Summary:
Result.compareResults is incorrect
Description:
A coworker of mine (James Taylor) found a bug in Result.compareResults(...).
This condition:
      if (!ourKVs[i].equals(replicatedKVs[i]) &&
          !Bytes.equals(ourKVs[i].getValue(), replicatedKVs[i].getValue())) {
        throw new Exception("This result was different: "
should be
      if (!ourKVs[i].equals(replicatedKVs[i]) ||
          !Bytes.equals(ourKVs[i].getValue(), replicatedKVs[i].getValue())) {
        throw new Exception("This result was different: "
Just checked, this is wrong in all branches.
