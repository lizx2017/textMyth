Summary:
Improve master start up time when there is log splitting work
Description:
When there is log split work going on, master start up waits till all log split work completes even though the log split has nothing to do with meta region servers.
It's a bad behavior considering a master node can run when log split is happening while its start up is blocking by log split work.
Since master is kind of single point of failure, we should start it ASAP.
