Summary:
Add hint to ExplicitColumnTracker to avoid seeking
Description:
The issue of slow seeking in ExplicitColumnTracker was brought up by Vladimir Rodionov on the dev list.
My idea here is to avoid the seeking if we know that there aren't many versions to skip.
How do we know? We'll use the column family's VERSIONS setting as a hint. If VERSIONS is set to 1 (or maybe some value < 10) we'll avoid the seek and call SKIP repeatedly.
HBASE-9769 has some initial number for this approach:
Interestingly it depends on which column(s) is (are) selected.
Some numbers: 4m rows, 5 cols each, 1 cf, 10 bytes values, VERSIONS=1, everything filtered at the server with a ValueFilter. Everything measured in seconds.
Without patch:
Wildcard Col 1 Col 2 Col 4 Col 5 Col 2+4
6.4 8.5 14.3 14.6 11.1 20.3
With patch:
Wildcard Col 1 Col 2 Col 4 Col 5 Col 2+4
6.4 8.4 8.9 9.9 6.4 10.0
Variation here was +- 0.2s.
So with this patch scanning is 2x faster than without in some cases, and never slower. No special hint needed, beyond declaring VERSIONS correctly.
