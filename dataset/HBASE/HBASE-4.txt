Summary:
hbase client makes too many requests against .META.,,1 table: caching of .META.,,1 lookups is broken?
Description:
We're running a high load of random reads through a single hbase rest server. When I look at the 60010 master servlet, there are a very high number of hits to the server hosting .META.,,1. That server has 4000 requests in the last "3 seconds", the server hosting ROOT (and two other regions which shouldn't be getting reads) has 80 requests, and all the other regionservers have less.
This doesn't seem right: shouldn't the single hbase client be caching table lookups?
This appears to be a hurdle for scaling our random read rate.
