Summary:
Restore HBCK fix of unassignment and dupe assignment for new master
Description:
HBCK fixing of region unassignment and duplicate assignment was broken with the move to the new master.
We've seen it happen doing testing of 0.90 RCs like that over in HBASE-3332.
Rather than the old "clear everything out approach" which relied on the BaseScanner, in the new master we should just manipulate unassigned ZK nodes and let the master handle the transition.
