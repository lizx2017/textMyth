Summary:
ThriftServer doesn't expose autoflush/writebuffer settings needed for write-heavy loads
Description:
For write-heavy/bulk-load environments, two common recommendations are to disable autoFlush and increase the size of the write buffer:
HTable.setAutoFlush(false)
HTable.setWriteBufferSize(long writeBufferSize)
Neither of exposed via the Thrift API, which seems to preclude using the Thrift interface for write-heavy environments.
As a workaround, we could specify hbase.client.write.buffer in hbase-site.xml, but there is unfortunately not an equivalent configuration setting for autoflush.
