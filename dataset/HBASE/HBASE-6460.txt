Summary:
hbck "-repairHoles" usage inconsistent with "-fixHdfsOrphans"
Description:
According to the hbck's help info, shortcut - "-repairHoles" will enable "-fixHdfsOrphans" as below.
 -repairHoles      Shortcut for -fixAssignments -fixMeta -fixHdfsHoles -fixHdfsOrphans
However, in the implementation, the function "fsck.setFixHdfsOrphans(false);" is called in "-repairHoles". This is not consistent with the usage information.
