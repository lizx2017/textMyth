Summary:
SplitLog Rescan BusyWaits upon Zk.CONNECTIONLOSS
Description:
We ran into a production issue yesterday where the SplitLogManager tried to create a Rescan node in ZK. The createAsync() generated a KeeperException.CONNECTIONLOSS that was immedately sent to processResult(), createRescan node with --retry_count was called, and this created a CPU busywait that also clogged up the logs. We should handle this better.
