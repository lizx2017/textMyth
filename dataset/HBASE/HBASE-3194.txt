Summary:
HBase should run on both secure and vanilla versions of Hadoop 0.20
Description:
There have been a couple cases recently of folks trying to run HBase trunk (or 0.89 DRs) on CDH3b3 or secure Hadoop. While HBase security is in the works, it currently only runs on secure Hadoop versions. Meanwhile HBase trunk won't compile on secure Hadoop due to backward incompatible changes in org.apache.hadoop.security.UserGroupInformation.
This issue is to work out the minimal set of changes necessary to allow HBase to build and run on both secure and non-secure versions of Hadoop. Though, with secure Hadoop, I don't even think it's important to target running with HDFS security enabled (and krb authentication). Just allow HBase to build and run in both versions.
I think mainly this amounts to abstracting usage of UserGroupInformation and UnixUserGroupInformation.
