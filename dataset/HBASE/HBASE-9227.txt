Summary:
RESTServer should handle the loginUser correctly
Description:
HBASE-8662 introduced a change by which the realUser in the method RESTServer.main() gets assigned to the loginUser only when the config hbase.rest.authentication.type is set to something (like "kerberos").
I think we should set the realUser to loginUser even when the config hbase.rest.authentication.type is null. Without that the regular (non-impersonated) accesses also fail.
