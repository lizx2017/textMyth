Summary:
hfile.min.blocksize.size ignored/documentation wrong
Description:
There is a property in hbase-default.xml called hfile.min.blocksize.size set to 65536.
The description says: Minimum store file block size. The smaller you make this, the bigger your index and the less you fetch on a random-access. Set size down if you have small cells and want faster random-access of individual cells.
This property is only used in the HFileOutputFormat and nowhere else. So we should at least change the description to something more meaningful.
The other option I see would be: HFile now has a DEFAULT_BLOCKSIZE field which could be moved to HConstants and HFile could somehow read the hfile.min.blocksize.size from the Configuration or use HConstansts.DEFAULT_BLOCKSIZE if it's not defined. I believe this is what's happening to the other config variables?
