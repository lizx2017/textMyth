Summary:
Zookeeper log4j property set to ERROR on default, same output when cluster working and not working
Description:
I was having some issues with getting zookeeper running, default log level being at ERROR meant that I didn't actually know whether the zk cluster was working or not. INFO is fairly noisy but might be best?
