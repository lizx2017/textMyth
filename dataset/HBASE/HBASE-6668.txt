Summary:
disable in shell may make confused to user
Description:
hbase(main):002:0> disable 'logTable'
0 row(s) in 2.0910 seconds
hbase(main):003:0> disable 'logTable'
0 row(s) in 0.0260 seconds
and we can found table are disabled in log when disable first appears
but when i disable it again the client just return seemed to be sucessful and I can not find any log described it in the log.
look into the admin.rb, find below
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Disables a table
def disable(table_name)
tableExists(table_name)
return if disabled?(table_name)
@admin.disableTable(table_name)
end
that would confuse us when we found it disabled already but returns nothing
