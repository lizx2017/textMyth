Summary:
OpenRegion could be ignored by mistake
Description:
Looked into failed test: http://54.241.6.143/job/HBase-0.95/org.apache.hbase$hbase-server/721/testReport/
In this test run, several tests in TestAssignmentManagerOnCluster failed. Most of them timed out because the first failure testOpenFailedUnrecoverable used too much resource in deleting the table.
http://54.241.6.143/job/HBase-0.95/org.apache.hbase$hbase-server/721/testReport/org.apache.hadoop.hbase.master/TestAssignmentManagerOnCluster/testOpenFailedUnrecoverable/
The reason testOpenFailedUnrecoverable failed is that the second openRegion call was ignored since the previous open call was still going on and stayed in OpenRegionHandler#doCleanUpOnFailedOpen for too long (perhaps thread scheduling issue). The second openRegion call was skipped since the region was still in the middle of opening. However, the failed_open event was already processed by master. Therefore the region stuck in transition and the delete table went no where. It is a similar issue as we ran into before while for that time, the region was closing.
