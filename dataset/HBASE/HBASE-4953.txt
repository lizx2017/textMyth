Summary:
Root region does not get assigned after doing kill -9 on all daemons and restarting HBase
Description:
When doing a kill -9 on all HBase processes and attempting to re-start HBase, the master does not properly assign the root region. The /hbase/root-region-server znode still contains the old regionserver, but the regionserver referenced in it does not get assigned the root region. This might get resolved after the znode expires, though, but some testing is required.
