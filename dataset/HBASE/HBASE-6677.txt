Summary:
Random ZooKeeper port in test can overrun max port
Description:
 
     while (true) {
        try {
          standaloneServerFactory = new NIOServerCnxnFactory();
          standaloneServerFactory.configure(
            new InetSocketAddress(tentativePort),
            configuration.getInt(HConstants.ZOOKEEPER_MAX_CLIENT_CNXNS,
              1000));
        } catch (BindException e) {
          LOG.debug("Failed binding ZK Server to client port: " +
              tentativePort);
          // This port is already in use, try to use another.
          tentativePort++;
          continue;
        }
        break;
      }
In the case of failure and all the above ports have already been binded, you can extend past the max port. Need to check against a max value.
