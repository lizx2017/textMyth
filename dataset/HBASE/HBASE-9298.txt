Summary:
ns checker runs too frequently; too much mention in master logs
Description:
Make ns checker run every 5 minutes instead of every 30 seconds.
Also fix a bit more logging. Can make the asyncprocess messages shorter by removing redundnate info like tablename.
Did pass removing 'region' and 'server' and META qualifiers where they are not needed.
