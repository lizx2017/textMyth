Summary:
need to be able to rolling restart hbase
Description:
Once a hbase install goes live, unless you can take the readers offline, you cannot stop and start the cluster to issue config changes, and other generalized changes.
We need to do a rolling restart. My own experiments confirmed that:
Restarting a regionserver works, you lose access to those regions, but comes back when that regionserver restarts moments later. Maybe there should be a 'reassign these regions because i am going to shut down' flag/code/command.
Restarting .META. regionserver just does not work. The master becomes confused. I have seen it reassign the .META. but not update ROOT, now no one knows where it is, and the root/meta scanners in the master just get hung.
Cant restart master yet, need multi-master election via ZK to make this happen.
This is a combo bug/feature request.
