Summary:
.META. region running into hfile errors
Description:
my .META. region refuses to do anything, I get this snippet of a error in the log file:
Caused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException at
java.nio.Buffer.position(Buffer.java:236) at
org.apache.hadoop.hbase.io.hfile.HFile$Reader$Scanner.blockSeek(HFile.java:1121)
Looks like the seek code is breaking somehow - seeking before the beginning of the block maybe?
