Summary:
HBase shell hangs when creating some 'illegal' tables.
Description:
In hbase shell. These commands hang:
create 'hbase.version','foo'
create 'splitlog','foo'
Interestingly
create 'hbase.id','foo'
create existingtablename, 'foo'
create '.META.','foo'
create '-ROOT-','foo'
are properly rejected.
We should probably either rename to make the files illegal table names (hbase.version to .hbase.version and splitlog to .splitlog) or we could add more special cases.
