Summary:
Add timeouts on all tests in TestHLogSplit
Description:
This test runs twice, once as plane TestHLogSplit and then again as TestHLogSplitCompressed. It shows up from time to time as an 'invisible' test â€“ a test that is not listed as one of the running tests in a failed build (but is present in builds that pass). Let me try setting timeouts on the 30odd tests in this class to see if that makes it fail fast rather than as an 'invisible'.
