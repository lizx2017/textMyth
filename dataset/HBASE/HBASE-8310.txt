Summary:
HBase snapshot timeout default values and TableLockManger timeout
Description:
There are a few timeout values and defaults being used by HBase snapshot.
DEFAULT_MAX_WAIT_TIME (60000 milli sec, 1 min) for client response
TIMEOUT_MILLIS_DEFAULT (60000 milli sec, 1 min) for Procedure timeout
SNAPSHOT_TIMEOUT_MILLIS_DEFAULT (60000 milli sec, 1 min) for region server subprocedure
There is also other timeout involved, for example,
DEFAULT_TABLE_WRITE_LOCK_TIMEOUT_MS (10 mins) for TakeSnapshotHandler#prepare()
We could have this case:
The user issues a sync snapshot request, waits for 1 min, and gets an exception.
In the meantime the snapshot handler is blocked on the table lock, and the snapshot may continue to finish after 10 mins.
But the user will probably re-issue the snapshot request during the 10 mins.
This is a little confusing and messy when this happens.
To be more reasonable, we should either increase the DEFAULT_MAX_WAIT_TIME or decrease the table lock waiting time.
