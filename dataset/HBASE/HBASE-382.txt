Summary:
HBase | Updated Documentation for HBase setup/installation
Description:
The documentation for setting up HBase is relatively unclear and was in need of updating. I have attached a patch that modifies the package.html file (which contains instructional sections such as "Getting Started") to improve the documentation.
