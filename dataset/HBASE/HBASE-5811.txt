Summary:
TestLoadAndSwitchEncodeOnDisk fails sometimes
Description:
Looks like its dependent on isTableEnabled actually returning true when the table is enabled only, isTableEnabled looks like its set whenever any region from a table is enabled which is not the semantic I remember it always having. This needs fixing. Meantime the test TestLoadAndSwitchEncodeOnDisk will fail for me sometimes.
