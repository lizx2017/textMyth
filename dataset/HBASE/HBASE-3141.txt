Summary:
Master RPC server needs to be started before an RS can check in
Description:
Starting up an RPC server is done in two steps. In the constructor, we instantiate the RPC server. Then in startServiceThreads() we start() it.
If someone RPCs in between the instantiation and the start(), it seems that bad things can happen. We need to make sure this can't happen and there aren't any races here.
