Summary:
Generalization of region move implementation + manage draining servers in bulk assign
Description:
The region move implementation now has now a similar behavior whatever the destination server is specified or not. This allows:
to benefit from the improvement in HBASE-5877
as a side effect to have the coprocessors calls when the destination server is not specified
This includes various fixes around draining servers. Draining servers were not excluded during a bulk assign. This is now fixed.
