Summary:
HBase Shell deleteall should not require column to be defined
Description:
It appears that the shell does not allow users to delete a row without specifying a column (deleteall). It looks like the deleteall.rb used to pre-define column as nil, making it optional.
I've created a patch and confirmed it to be working in standalone mode, I will upload it shortly.
