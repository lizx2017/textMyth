Summary:
TestHCM failing sporadically on jenkins and always for me on an ubuntu machine
Description:
TestHCM takes 13 minutes for me on ubuntu and fails in testClosing. It runs fine on a mac. The problem test is not testClosing as I thought originally, its the test just previous, testConnectionUniqueness. testConnectionUniqueness creates the maximum cached HConnections + 10 to verify each is unique if the passed in Configuration has a unique hash. Problem comes when zk enforces its default max from single host of 30 connections which is < (max cached + 10). The max does not seem to be enforced on mac for me. The max connections runs up to max of 31 – zk max + 1 – and works fine until we do the +10. On ubuntu, when we hit the zk max of 30, we'll then go into a fail mode where we cannot set up a zk session... each attempt takes a while. Test passes, it just takes a while.
Only, the uniqueness test does not clean up after itself and so all sessions to zk are outstanding so then when the subsequent testClosing runs, it can't set up connections successfully so fails.
