Summary:
Javadoc: Document that HBaseAdmin.flush(...) is synchronous
Description:
Currently the Javadoc in HBaseAdmin.flush(...) says that this is an asynchronous operation. Looking at the, however, it is in fact not.
Having this as a synchronous operation open ups some use cases we're interested in. For example doing some ingest via the high level API with WAL disabled and then issue a flush through the HBaseAdmin. When the flush succeeded we know the data is securely in HBase.
(This should work even with intermediary splits, as they also force a flush, but that needs to be verified as well.
So this is just for a trivial Javadoc change.
