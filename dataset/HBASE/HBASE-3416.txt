Summary:
For intra-row scanning, the update readers notification resets the query matcher and can lead to incorrect behavior
Description:
In StoreScanner.resetScannerStack(), which is called on the first next() call after readers have been updated, we do a query matcher reset. Normally this is not an issue because the query matcher does not need to maintain state between rows. However, if doing intra-row scanning w/ the specified limit, we could have the query matcher reset in the middle of reading a row. This could lead to incorrect behavior (too many versions coming back, etc).
