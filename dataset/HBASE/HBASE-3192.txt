Summary:
Test that HBase runs when a .META. row without an HRI
Description:
A .META. without an HRI entry should never happen but if it does, it should not cause master shutdown (master is on a hair-trigger at mo. so that issues are noticed quickly). HBASE-3151 fixed being able to deal w/ empty HRI. This issue is about adding a test to verify hbase stays up (make sure chore runs and that test does meta scanning with MetaScanner and MetaReader).
