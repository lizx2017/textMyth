Summary:
Log Splitting & Replay: Distinguish between Network IOE and Parsing IOE
Description:
Originally, if HBase got an IOE from HDFS while splitting or opening a region, it would abort the operation. The assumption being that this is a network failure that will likely disappear at a later time or different partition of the network. However, if HBase gets parsing exceptions, we want to log the problem and continue opening/splitting the region anyways, because parsing is an idempotent problem and retries won't fix this issue.
