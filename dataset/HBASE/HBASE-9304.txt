Summary:
[0.92] TestDrainingServer fails occasionally
Description:
The error is the same in every case:
junit.framework.AssertionFailedError
 at junit.framework.Assert.fail(Assert.java:48)
 at junit.framework.Assert.assertTrue(Assert.java:20)
 at junit.framework.Assert.assertFalse(Assert.java:34)
 at junit.framework.Assert.assertFalse(Assert.java:41)
 at org.apache.hadoop.hbase.TestDrainingServer.setUpBeforeClass(TestDrainingServer.java:78)
This is a check at test startup that every regionserver has an assignment. Looks like sometimes it takes a long time for the cluster to come up - there are 5 RSes started - and not all get region assignments. Probably a test only fix here.
