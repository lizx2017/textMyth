Summary:
HMaster does not go down while splitting logs even if explicit shutdown is called.
Description:
When master starts up and tries to do splitlog, in case of any error we try to do that infinitely in a loop until it succeeds.
But now if we get a shutdown call, inside SplitLogManager
          if (stopper.isStopped()) {
            LOG.warn("Stopped while waiting for log splits to be completed");
            return;
          }
Here we know that the master has stopped. As the task may not be completed now
 if (batch.done != batch.installed) {
      batch.isDead = true;
      tot_mgr_log_split_batch_err.incrementAndGet();
      LOG.warn("error while splitting logs in " + logDirs +
      " installed = " + batch.installed + " but only " + batch.done + " done");
      throw new IOException("error or interrupt while splitting logs in "
          + logDirs + " Task = " + batch);
    }
we throw an exception. In MasterFileSystem.splitLogAfterStartup() we don't check if the master is stopped and we try continously.
