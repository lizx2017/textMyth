Summary:
Short-Circuit Coprocessor doesn't correctly lookup table when on server
Description:
If the coprocessor isn't on the server hosting root/meta/the target HTable, it will fall back to doing the usual HConnection lookup.
However, that call then calls the overloaded getHRegionConnection methods, which HBASE-9534 previously made unsupported for Coprocessors. The initial idea was to limit the number of paths that we could lookup a region, but it was just incorrectly done.
