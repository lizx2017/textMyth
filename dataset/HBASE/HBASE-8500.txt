Summary:
RollingRestart utility at regionserver level
Description:
With the option of blacklisting a region server from getting assigned new regions by the master, we need to have a utility which encapsulates this and uses it for rolling restart of a hbase cluster. The JIRA is to create a utility which restarts a single region server by:
1. blacklisting the region server
2. moving all the regions one by one
3. restart the region server process
4. moving all the regions back
5. removing the region server from blacklist
Along with this, the utility should also be able to estimate the total outage observed from client perspective.
