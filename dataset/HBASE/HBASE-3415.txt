Summary:
When scanners have readers updated we should use original file selection algorithm rather than include all files
Description:
Currently when a StoreScanner is instantiated we use a getScanner(scan, columns) call that looks at things like bloom filters and memstore only flags. But when we get a changed readers notification, we use getScanner() which just grabs everything.
We should always use the original file selection algorithm.
