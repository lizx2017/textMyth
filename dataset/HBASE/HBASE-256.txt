Summary:
[hbase] "The only time that a meta scanner should try to recover a log is when the master is starting."
Description:
Jim points out over in HADOOP-2283 that meta scanner should only replay logs on startup. Currently its possible that it may do so at a point well past startup. Could clash w/ shutdown server code's splitting of edit log.
