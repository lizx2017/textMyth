Summary:
fix spurious -1's from Hadoop QA
Description:
Hadoop QA generated comments based on patches submitted to JIRAs; for example:
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-4960?focusedCommentId=13163191&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13163191
There are some spurious -1's given to the patch. The patch only affects documentation, not source code, but Hadoop QA says that:
-1 findbugs. The patch appears to introduce 72 new Findbugs (version 1.3.9)
warnings.
Evidently Hadoop QA is not able to recall the set of Findbugs warnings from the previous build.
(Of course the Findbugs warnings themselves should be addressed, but this patch could not have added to them).
-1 javadoc. The javadoc tool appears to have generated -160 warning
messages.
This should be "160 warning messages", not "-160 warning messages".
Thanks to NKeywal for suggesting that the relevant file is dev-support/test-patch.sh.
