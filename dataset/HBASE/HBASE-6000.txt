Summary:
Cleanup where we keep .proto files
Description:
I see Andrew for his pb work over in rest has .protos files under src/main/resources. We should unify where these files live. The recently added .protos place them under src/main/protobuf Its confusing.
The thift idl files are here under resources too.
Seems like we should move src/main/protobuf under src/resources to be consistent.
