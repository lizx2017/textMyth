Summary:
[book] zookeeper quorum mistake
Description:
In Chapter 2, section 2.5 "ZooKeeper" under "How many ZooKeepers should I run?" there is the sentence
There can be no quorum if the number of members is an even number.
This is not true. In ZooKeeper, an even number of peers is supported, but it is normally not used because an even sized ensemble requires, proportionally, more peers to form a quorum than an odd sized ensemble requires. For example, an ensemble with 4 peers requires 3 to form a quorum, while an ensemble with 5 also requires 3 to form a quorum. Thus, an ensemble of 5 allows 2 peers to fail, and thus is more fault tolerant than the ensemble of 4, which allows only 1 down peer.
