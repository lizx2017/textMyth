Summary:
With HFile v2, the region server will always perform an extra copy of source files
Description:
With HFile v2 implementation in HBase 0.94 & 0.96, the region server will use HFileSystem as its fs. When it performs bulk load in Store.bulkLoadHFile(), it checks if its fs is the same as srcFs, which however will be DistributedFileSystem. Consequently, it will always perform an extra copy of source files.
