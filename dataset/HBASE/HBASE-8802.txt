Summary:
totalCompactingKVs may overflow
Description:
I happened to get a very large region (mistakely bulk loading tons of HFile into a signle region). When it's getting compacted, the webUI shows a overflow totalCompactingKVs. I found this is due to Compactor#FileDetails#maxKeyCount is int32. It is not a big deal that this variable is only used for displaying compaction progress and everywhere else uses long.
totalCompactingKVs=1909276739, currentCompactedKVs=11308733425,
