Summary:
not able to run the test suite in background because TestShell gets suspended on tty output
Description:
Can't run the test suite in background. Problem seems to be due to TestShell.
This works fine:
% mvn test -Dtest=TestShell -Dtest.output=true
But:
% mvn test -Dtest=TestShell -Dtest.output=true & 
or,
% mvn test -Dtest=TestShell -Dtest.output=true >& test.log &
causes test to hang, and eventually timeout after 3600 seconds.
The process is reported as being suspended on tty output.
[3] + Suspended (tty output) mvn test -Dtest=TestShell -Dtest.output=true
