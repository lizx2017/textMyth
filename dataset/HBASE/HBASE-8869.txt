Summary:
incorrect javadoc for CompactionRequest.compareTo()
Description:
   * <p>Note: The date is only accurate to the millisecond which means it is
   * possible that two requests were inserted into the queue within a
   * millisecond.  When that is the case this function will break the tie
   * arbitrarily.
but in real code, the granularity is ns, not ms: this.timeInNanos = System.nanoTime();
