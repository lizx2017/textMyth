Summary:
Recovered replication queue wait on themselves when terminating
Description:
When I ported the replication code on the new master I broke a few things, and it seems that the threads created for recovered queues never properly terminate because they join on themselves. Easy fix in ReplicationSource:
-      this.terminate("Finished recovering the queue");
+      LOG.info("Finished recovering the queue");
+      this.running = false;
