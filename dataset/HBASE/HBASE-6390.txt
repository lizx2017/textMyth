Summary:
append() and increment() may result in inconsistent result on retries.
Description:
append() and increment() api can give inconsistent result in following scenarios :
1- For eg, if the client does not receive the response in the specified time, it retries. Now the first call to increment/append is already done and this retry will again make the operation to succeed.
2- Now if the sync() to WAL fails we get an IOException, on getting an exception there is a retry done which again results in the doing the increment/append again.
When may need some sort of roll back for the second problem.
For the first one we need to see how to handle this.
