Summary:
Will keep scheduling major compactions if last time one ran, we didn't.
Description:
Excerpt below has major compactions scheduled ever few hours but nothing to compact each time through – last run was a major compaction – and times are off. Need to touch files if nothing to compact so major doesn't get scheduled again.

Then it says:
2008-12-20 13:47:43,935 DEBUG org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.HStore: Skipping major compaction because only one (major) compacted file only and elapsedTime 289999825 is < ttl=-1
I think whats happening is that we're not compacting because we just did but major compactions keep getting triggered because we are not updating the file timestamp. Look into it. At least fix up logging so its clearer whats happening.. Here is snippet:
