Summary:
Enable and disable of table needs a bit of loving in new master
Description:
The tools are in place to do a more reliable enable/disable of tables. Some work has been done to hack in a basic enable/disable but its not enough – see the test avro/thrift tests where a disable/enable/disable switchback can confuse the table state (and has been disabled until this issue addressed).
This issue is about finishing off enable/disable in the new master. I think we need to add to the table znode an enabling/disabling state rather than have them binary with a watcher that will stop an enable (or disable) starting until the previous completes (Currently we atomically switch the state though the region close/open lags – some work in enable/disable handlers helps in that they won't complete till all regions have transitioned.. but its not enough).
Need to add tests too.
Marking issue critical bug because loads of the questions we get on lists are about enable/disable probs.
