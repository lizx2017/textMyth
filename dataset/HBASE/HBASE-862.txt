Summary:
region balancing is clumsy
Description:
Daniel Leffel has an install of 500 regions on 4 nodes. He's running 0.2.0.
On restart, load balancing is running while the 600 regions are being initially opened. Makes for churn. Load balancing should wait before it cuts in.
Have also seen on occasion that it will not find equilibrium after a restart.
Adding a node is catastrophic. >20% of the regions were closed and were taking the longest time to show up on the new server. I would think that the region balancing would work in more sophisticated and gradual manner.
