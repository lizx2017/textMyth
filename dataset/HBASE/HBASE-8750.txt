Summary:
MetaServerShutdownHandler stucks if .META. assignment fails in previous attempt
Description:
While running log replay on a one node setup, I killed meta regionserver. The MetaSSH tries to assign the meta table, but it failed as there was no other regionservers to assign to. But the meta server znode was already updated to null. When the assignment fails, the metaSSH is retried. But from the next iteration, it will not try to assign the meta region, but keeps on waiting for meta region. This keeps on going even after regionserver is brought up again.
