Summary:
HBaseAdmin.tableExists(new Text("TestTable5")) returns false when table actually exists.
Description:
Process:
One the 1st run of the application, i use tableExists( new Text("TestTable5")) & tableCreate to create the table.
On the 2nd run, I call tableExists(new Text("TestTable5")), which returns false, then i call disableTable, deleteTable, and finally createTable.
Workaround for now is to avoid using Text. tableExists(byte[]) works when i tested it.
To test this, you have to run the program 2 times. Once to create the table that doesnt exist, then the 2nd time to see the error.
