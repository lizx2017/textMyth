Summary:
IllegalStateException when new server comes online, is given 200 regions to open and 200th region gets timed out of regions in transition
Description:
Yesterday we committed a change that makes it so the master will crash is a zk transition that is unexpected. Its extreme but good for highlighting bad state changes (we also started marking these as illegalstateexceptions yesterday too).
So, testing new master I brought up a new server. Balancer tried to give new server 256 regions.
2010-10-01 16:01:42,972 INFO org.apache.hadoop.hbase.master.LoadBalancer: Calculated a load balance in 0ms. Moving 256 regions off of 7 overloaded servers onto 1 less loaded servers
Turns out we failed complete open of all 256 servers within the regions-in-transition timeout period so we tried to reassign. The master aborted because region was in the PENDING_OPEN state when we went about assigning.
