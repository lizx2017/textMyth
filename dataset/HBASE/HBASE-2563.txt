Summary:
Deprecate methods which accept as a parameter or return a value of type Cell
Description:
We've deprecated io.Cell, so we should probably deprecate methods which return or accept Cell values. See http://hadoop.apache.org/hbase/docs/r0.20.4/api/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/io/class-use/Cell.html for the complete list. Here are some selections:
getCellValue(), getCellValue(byte[], byte[]), and getCellValues() methods of client.Result
Entry.getValue() and Entry.setValue(Cell) methods of io.RowResult
cellFromHBase(Cell[]) and cellFromHBase(Cell) methods of thrift.ThriftUtilities
Writables.cellToLong(Cell), Writables.cellToString(Cell), and Writables.getHRegionInfo(Cell) methods of hbase.util
Also some hbase.rest stuff, but I don't know what's going on there.
