Summary:
TestZKBasedOpenCloseRegion.testReOpenRegion fails occasionally
Description:
Failed here:
https://builds.apache.org/job/HBase-TRUNK-on-Hadoop-2.0.0/607/testReport/org.apache.hadoop.hbase.master/TestZKBasedOpenCloseRegion/testReOpenRegion/
and
https://builds.apache.org/job/HBase-TRUNK/4232/testReport/org.apache.hadoop.hbase.master/TestZKBasedOpenCloseRegion/testReOpenRegion/
In both cases, we fail for the same reason. The previous test closes a region. The failing test starts but we are reopening the region we'd just closed as we are wont to do. This is the region that gets chosen by the failing test to practise reopen on only it is not yet fully open so in comes the close and it gets stomped on by the ongoing open.
Let me post some log.
