Summary:
Perf: parallelize puts
Description:
Right now with large region count tables, the write buffer is not efficient. This is because we issue potentially N RPCs, where N is the # of regions in the table. When N gets large (lets say 1200+) things become sloowwwww.
Instead if we batch things up using a different RPC and use thread pools, we could see higher performance!
This requires a RPC change...
