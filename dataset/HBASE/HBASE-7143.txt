Summary:
TestMetaMigrationRemovingHTD fails when used with Hadoop 0.23/2.x
Description:
TestMetaMigrationRemovingHTD fails when build is done with "-Dhadoop.profile=23" option.
The reason is the changes of defaults in "-mkdir" CLI call. In 0.23/2.x, it doesn't create parent directories by default anymore.
The patch will be submitted shortly.
