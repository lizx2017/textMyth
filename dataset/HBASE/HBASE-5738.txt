Summary:
Using HBase with HA HDFS requires bogus hardcoded port value
Description:
When configuring HBase with HDFS HA, we currently have to have the 8020 port (regardless of what port HDFS is using for the namenode rpc address) in the following property in hbase-site.xml:
  <property>
    <name>hbase.rootdir</name>
    <value>hdfs://ha-nn-uri:8020/hbase</value>
  </property>
Otherwise the master and regionservers will not start.
The value in the above property should really just be "hdfs://ha-nn-uri/hbase" (replace "ha-nn-uri" with your uri and "hbase" with the name of the hbase directory in HDFS that you are using, as appropriate).
