Summary:
TableInputFormatBase with row filters scan too far
Description:
When TableInputFormatBase has a non-null RowFilterInterface to apply, it creates combines the row filter with a StopRowFilter to get a scanner for each input split. However, the StopRowFilter never indicates that fitlerAllRemaining is true, so each input split will end up scanning to the end of the table. (Contrast with HTable.getScanner(byte[][] columns, byte[] starRow, byte[] stopRow, long timestamp) which uses a StopRowFilter wrapped in a WhileMatchRowFilter to ensure that scanning ends at the stop row.
