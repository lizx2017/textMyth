Summary:
Allow non-admin users to list all table names
Description:
HBASE-8692, prevents users retrieving table descriptors they don't have admin access to. As a side-effect it also prevents non-admin users from being able to list tables in the CLI. One proposal to fix this is to provide an API in HMaster which returns a list of table names only.
