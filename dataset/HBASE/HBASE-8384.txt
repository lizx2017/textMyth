Summary:
heap size computation for HStore is fishy
Description:
There's something off with heap size computation for HStore. If one adds a long to HStore, and size of long to the computation, TestHeapSize passes both locally (for me) and in jenkins. If one adds an int and size of int, it passes locally but fails in Jenkins. Perhaps the numbers are already off and some sort of packing is taking/not taking place differently.
On a tangentially related note, if we can obtain size programmatically (the way we do it in test), and only need to do it once, I wonder if we should just do it and remove all the manually modifiable constants stuff.
