Summary:
ganglia metrics should have a common prefix so we can group easier
Description:
The metrics exported are intermixed with other ganglia metrics... some of the names used are very common like 'requests'. Instead we should use a prefix like "hbase_" so they appear both grouped and separate in ganglia UIs.
