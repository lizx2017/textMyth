Summary:
Change unittests that use "table" or "testtable" to use method names.
Description:
While working on HBASE-9686, many tests left files that indicated the method they had come from but several drop data in "table" or "testtable" tables. Naming them this way makes it hard to track which tests these came from. We should make all test use
@Rule TestName name = new TestName();
...
TableName t = TableName.valueOf(name.getMethodName());
