Summary:
-ROOT- and .META. are stale in table.jsp if they moved
Description:
table.jsp does not use a lookup method on CatalogTracker that does not force a refresh of the cache, thus it can get a stale location if ROOT or .META. moved and the master hasn't tried to access them yet.
Should just be a matter of using waitForRoot/Meta.
