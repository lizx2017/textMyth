Summary:
Table name isn't checked in isTableEnabled/isTableDisabled
Description:
Currently when we enable or disable a table in the shell, since we don't verify the table name with HTableDescriptor.isLegalTableName in isTableEnabled and isTableDisabled, we get the following exception:
ERROR: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Invalid path string "/jdcryans180/table/TestTable
" caused by invalid charater @28
This is coming out of ZooKeeper. Instead we should check the table name ourselves in order to give a better feedback.
