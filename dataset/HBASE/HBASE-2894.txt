Summary:
MultiPut exposes public fields
Description:
MultiPut.java
public class MultiPut implements Writable {
  public HServerAddress address; // client code ONLY                                              
        
  // map of regions to lists of puts for that region.                                             
  public Map<byte[], List<Put> > puts = new TreeMap<byte[], List<Put>>(Bytes.BYTES_COMPARATOR);
[...]
I don't see any reason for those fields to be public. Let's make sure this doesn't leak to a stable release, otherwise it becomes part of the API.
Fixing this issue may be pointless if this ever happens: http://su.pr/1SG7fB
edit: Similarly, MultiPutResponse has two fields that are protected, but need not to be:
MultiPutResponse.java
public class MultiPutResponse implements Writable {
                
  protected MultiPut request; // used in client code ONLY
                  
  protected Map<byte[], Integer> answers = new TreeMap<byte[], Integer>(Bytes.BYTES_COMPARATOR);
[...]
