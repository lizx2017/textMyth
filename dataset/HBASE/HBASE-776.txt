Summary:
Master not reassigning .META. from failed/failing regionserver
Description:
In our environment sometimes the regionserver carrying META is also assigned to the 'content' table, into which objects retrieved from Internet crawling is stored. For unclear reason the regionserver occasionally goes "deaf" (seperate issue) and when this happens META is no longer available. The master then never reassigns META, so the whole cluster is down from this point and does not recover. Logs attached.
