Summary:
Hadoop jars used in HBase/lib are not compatible with Hadoop-trunk
Description:
The hadoop jars included in the HBase tree under /lib are not compatible with hadoop-core trunk.
Apparently there have been a couple of revisions to the Hadoop RPC protocol so an HBase built with the included jars will not run against a hadoop trunk cluster.
