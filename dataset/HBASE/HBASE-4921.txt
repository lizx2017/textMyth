Summary:
HTable initialization looks for EMPTY_START_ROW
Description:
The HTable initialization does something like this :
this.connection.locateRegion(tableName, HConstants.EMPTY_START_ROW);
What is the rationale behind this ? What would happen if this region is in flight ? I ran into a problem where I disabled the first region of the table and now I can't create an HTable instance to this table.
Disabling the first region is like disabling the entire table from a client perspective. I feel this is not the correct behavior.
