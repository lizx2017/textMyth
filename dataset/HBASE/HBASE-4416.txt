Summary:
OpenedRegionHandler running for a dead assignment will kill the master
Description:
It goes like this:
Master balances region R from server A to server B
B reports OPENED of R
Master queues a OpenedRegionHandler for R on B
B dies (sad)
Master processes the splits and reassigns R to C
C reports OPENED of R
Master queues a OpenedRegionHandler for R on C
OpenedRegionHandler for R on B is finally processed, but leaves the region in a weird state (log #1)
OpenedRegionHandler for R on C is processed, fails when it tries to delete the znode, kills the master (log #2)
If the master didn't commit seppuku, it would have had a wrong view of the state of that region because it wouldn't link it to the region server that really opened it in the end.
I'm not sure how I would go fixing this though...
