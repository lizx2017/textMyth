Summary:
HCD should only have those fields explicitly set by user while creating tables
Description:
right now we take the default HCD fields and 'snapshot' them into every HCD. So things like 'BLOCKCACHE' and 'FILESIZE' are in every table, even if they don't differ from the defaults. If the default changes in a meanful/important way, the user is left with the unenviable task of (a) determining this happened and (b) actually going through and disabling/altering the tables to fix it.
