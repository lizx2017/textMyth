Summary:
HFileArchiver.resolveAndArchive() race condition may lead to snapshot data loss
Description:
The master have an hfile cleaner thread (that is responsible for cleaning the /hbase/.archive dir)
/hbase/.archive/table/region/family/hfile
if the family/region/family directory is empty the cleaner removes it
The master can archive files (from another thread, e.g. DeleteTableHandler)
The region can archive files (from another server/process, e.g. compaction)
The simplified file archiving code looks like this:
HFileArchiver.resolveAndArchive(...) {
  // ensure that the archive dir exists
  fs.mkdir(archiveDir);

  // move the file to the archiver
  success = fs.rename(originalPath/fileName, archiveDir/fileName)

  // if the rename is failed, delete the file without archiving
  if (!success) fs.delete(originalPath/fileName);
}
Since there's no synchronization between HFileArchiver.resolveAndArchive() and the cleaner run (different process, thread, ...) you can end up in the situation where you are moving something in a directory that doesn't exists.
fs.mkdir(archiveDir);

// HFileCleaner chore starts at this point
// and the archiveDirectory that we just ensured to be present gets removed.

// The rename at this point will fail since the parent directory is missing.
success = fs.rename(originalPath/fileName, archiveDir/fileName)
The bad thing of deleting the file without archiving is that if you've a snapshot that relies on the file to be present, or you've a clone table that relies on that file is that you're losing data.
Possible solutions
Create a ZooKeeper lock, to notify the master ("Hey I'm archiving something, wait a bit")
Add a RS -> Master call to let the master removes files and avoid this kind of situations
Avoid to remove empty directories from the archive if the table exists or is not disabled
Add a try catch around the fs.rename
The last one, the easiest one, looks like:
for (int i = 0; i < retries; ++i) {
  // ensure archive directory to be present
  fs.mkdir(archiveDir);

  // ----> possible race <-----

  // try to archive file
  success = fs.rename(originalPath/fileName, archiveDir/fileName);
  if (success) break;
}
