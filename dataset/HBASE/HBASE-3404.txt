Summary:
Compaction Ordering for Bulk Import Files
Description:
We got into an issue today where we were using HFileOutputFormat to perform an incremental load on an already-large cluster. Because bulk-loaded files don't have a sequence ID, they are put in the front of the StoreFile list. This resulted in the following StoreFile ordering
2GB (bulk) => 25GB => 2GB => ...
So this triggered a 30+GB major compaction for every single region. Optimally, we would like bulk import files to be ordered in the compaction list at the time of insertion so this can be a much smaller compaction and rely on StoreFile age for major compaction trigger.
