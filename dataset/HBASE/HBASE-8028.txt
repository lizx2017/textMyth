Summary:
Append, Increment: Adding rollback support
Description:
In case there is an exception while doing the log-sync, the memstore is not rollbacked, while the mvcc is always forwarded to the writeentry created at the beginning of the operation. This may lead to scanners seeing results which are not synched to the fs.
