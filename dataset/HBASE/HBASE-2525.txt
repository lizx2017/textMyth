Summary:
If one-RS only and its restarted before its shutdown is completely processed, we'll never complete shutdown processing
Description:
This is why TestZooKeeper is currently broken in build. There is a single RS only in that test. Its restarted using the hbase.regionserver.restart.on.zk.expire facility in the RS. HBASE-2413 added blocking new servers of same host+port until the old is processed but if the old was only server carrying root and meta, and we won't let in the new server until the old server is processed AND processing of old server shutdown inline has assignment of root and meta, we're stuck.
