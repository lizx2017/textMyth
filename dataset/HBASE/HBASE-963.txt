Summary:
Fix the retries in HTable.flushCommit
Description:
Many are seeing writes not getting into tables since HBASE-748 was committed. As I explained to Jonathan:
<jdcryans> jgray: but I'm pretty sure that under high load a split took too long and the write didn't get through
<jdcryans> jgray: That part has to be refactored to be used with other kind of batching
<jdcryans> jgray: because the exponential backoff retry logic is in HCM but I had to get the retry out of it...
So this issue is about getting the retry logic out of HTable, hopefully merging it with the rest of HCM.
