Summary:
Offline Meta Repair no longer points to the correct location
Description:
B.4.3. Special case: Root and META are corrupt.
The most drastic corruption scenario is the case where the ROOT or META is corrupted and HBase will not start. In this case you can use the OfflineMetaRepair tool create new ROOT and META regions and tables. This tool assumes that HBase is offline. It then marches through the existing HBase home directory, loads as much information from region metadata files (.regioninfo files) as possible from the file system. If the region metadata has proper table integrity, it sidelines the original root and meta table directories, and builds new ones with pointers to the region directories and their data.
$ ./bin/hbase org.apache.hadoop.hbase.util.OfflineMetaRepair
The path should be org.apache.hadoop.hbase.util.hbck.OfflineMetaRepair
