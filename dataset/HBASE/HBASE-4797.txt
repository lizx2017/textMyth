Summary:
[availability] Skip recovered.edits files with edits we know older than what region currently has
Description:
Testing 0.92, I crashed all servers out. Another bug makes it so WALs are not getting cleaned so I had 7000 regions to replay. The distributed split code did a nice job and cluster came back but interesting is that some hot regions ended up having loads of recovered.edits files – tens if not hundreds – to replay against the region (can we bulk load recovered.edits instead of replaying them?). Each recovered.edits file is taking about a second to process (though only about 30 odd edits per file it seems). The region is unavailable during this time.
