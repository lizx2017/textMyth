Summary:
Upgrade site plugin; fix assembly doc up on jenkins builds
Description:
Up on jenkins, we currently make assemblies but there no doc in them. The site goal runs last. You can't run it anywhere else else build fails. Upgrading the site plugin helps. Upgrading site plugin I notice that there are a bunch of extra reports generated that would be no harm showing on the web site; e.g. dependencies transitively included, what dependencies we have, etc. This issue is about upgrading site plugin to fix jenkins assemblies and to expose reports we are generating anyways (at least one report is new w/ the info-report upgrade from earlier today).
