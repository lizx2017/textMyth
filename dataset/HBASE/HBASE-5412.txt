Summary:
HBase book, section 2.6.4, has deficient list of client dependencies
Description:
The current text in section 2.6.4 of the HBase book says this about client dependencies:
Minimally, a client of HBase needs the hbase, hadoop, log4j, commons-logging, commons-lang, and ZooKeeper jars in its CLASSPATH connecting to a cluster.
I tried that, and got an exception due to a class not being found. I fixed that by searching for that class in the jars in lib/, and tried again. Got an exception, due to a different class not found. I iterated until it worked. When I was done, I found myself using the following JARs:
commons-configuration-1.6.jar hadoop-core-1.0.0.jar slf4j-api-1.5.8.jar
commons-lang-2.5.jar hbase-0.92.0.jar slf4j-log4j12-1.5.8.jar
commons-logging-1.1.1.jar log4j-1.2.16.jar zookeeper-3.4.2.jar
