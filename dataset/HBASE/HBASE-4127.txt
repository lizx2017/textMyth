Summary:
HBaseAdmin : Don't modify table's name away
Description:
One of the developers was using the default constructor for HTableDescriptor, which is sadly a bad constructor that should never be used. It made the tablename empty in META & caused an ERROR cycle as region onlining kept failing. We should have never let this happen. Don't do table modifications if the HTableDescriptor name doesn't match the table name passed in.
