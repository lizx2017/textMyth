Summary:
New UI elements may request external resources
Description:
After HBASE-6135, the UI may, depending on browser version, attempt to pull in external resources, e.g. from MasterStatusTmpl.jamon:
    <!--[if lt IE 9]>
      <script src="http://html5shim.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/html5.js"></script>
    <![endif]-->
This won't work if the UI is viewed in a restricted environment. Also, pulling external resources from Googlecode / SVN like this seems not a good practice, those can change at any given third party checkin.
Rather, we should pull in any resources needed into our /static/ ?
