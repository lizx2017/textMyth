Summary:
Master goes to infinite loop if AccessControlException occurs while setting cluster id during initialization
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
change permission of /hbase to a user other than one running hbase
delete hbase.id if already exists
start master, it will try to create cluster ID file in /hbase and fail while doing so with org.apache.hadoop.security.AccessControlException
From this point it will go to infinite loop.
Reason: org.apache.hadoop.hbase.util.FSUtils.setClusterId has a wait > 0 and no control over retries when called during master initialization.
Quoting : checkRootDir in MasterFileSystem
// Make sure cluster ID exists
    if (!FSUtils.checkClusterIdExists(fs, rd, c.getInt(
        HConstants.THREAD_WAKE_FREQUENCY, 10 * 1000))) {
      FSUtils.setClusterId(fs, rd, UUID.randomUUID().toString(), c.getInt(
          HConstants.THREAD_WAKE_FREQUENCY, 10 * 1000));
    }
