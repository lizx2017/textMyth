Summary:
TestFlushSnapshotFromClient.testConcurrentSnapshottingAttempts fails
Description:
Assigning Matteo to take a look (give back to me if you don't have time boss).
Failed here: https://builds.apache.org/job/HBase-TRUNK/4293/testReport/org.apache.hadoop.hbase.snapshot/TestFlushSnapshotFromClient/testConcurrentSnapshottingAttempts/
Yesterday, it failed in a different place and for different reason: https://builds.apache.org/view/H-L/view/HBase/job/hbase-0.95/352/testReport/junit/org.apache.hadoop.hbase.snapshot/TestFlushSnapshotFromClient/testFlushTableSnapshot/
The latter test fail was noted on tail of HBASE-8984. There I speculate that its the 'load' of 400. I don't think the load reporting is correct. Will dig in on that.
