Summary:
Fully qualified hbase.rootdir doesn't work
Description:
Jim was setting up cluster w/ new hbase. Setting fully qualified hbase.rootdir was failing. Complaint was that the filesystems didn't match â€“ i.e. the hdfs of the fully qualified hbase.rootdir didn't jibe w/ the default hadoop file:///.
Fix needs to be backported.
The problem was that because the hadoop config files were not found (because they are in a different directory and not on the classpath) then fs.get(conf) returns file:///
