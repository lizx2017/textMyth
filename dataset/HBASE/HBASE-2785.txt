Summary:
TestScannerTimeout.test2772 is flaky
Description:
I knew that that test could be flaky but it seemed to work fine for a while. Basically if the region server takes too long to abort (more than 6 seconds) then the client will detect that the scanner expired instead of just moving. Find a less flaky way.
