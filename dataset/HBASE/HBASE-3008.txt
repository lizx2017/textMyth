Summary:
Memstore.updateColumnValue passes wrong flag to heapSizeChange
Description:
Memstore.updateColumnValue passes the wrong flag to heapSizeChange, making it so that the size keeps growing while the actual size is probably the same. For example, in our production environment we see tables that only take ICVs doing flushes of a few KBs when it thinks there's 64MB in:
Started memstore flush for region somecountingtable,,1248719998664.121282795. Current region memstore size 64.0
Added hdfs://borg9:9000/hbase/somecountingtable/121282795/counter/3564459650504019443, entries=905, sequenceid=72504291507, 
memsize=183.3k, filesize=18.5k to somecountingtable,,1248719998664.121282795
