Summary:
HbaseAdmin.createTable cannot handle creating three regions
Description:
createTable(HTableDescriptor desc, byte [] startKey, byte [] endKey, int numRegions) (line #370) dictates that you must specify a minimum of three regions, however is not able to handle being fed a value three. This is a result of line #379 where it attempts to create the key splits, and calls Bytes.Split with a value of 0 for the third parameter. createTable should instead just create a byte[][] with the startKey and endKey in this scenario.
