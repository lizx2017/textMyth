Summary:
OrderedBytes does not decode Strings correctly
Description:
While writing a test describing the expected behavior for HBASE-9283, I discovered an error in String decoding. The error occurs when the string being decoded does not start at position 0. The unit tests were originally designed to cover this scenario, but this condition slipped in the transition to PositionedByteBuffer.
Update the tests to cover this scenario and fix the String decoding logic. String appears to be the only codec affected. This error is only in decoding â€“ encoding produces correct byte[].
