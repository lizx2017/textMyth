Summary:
Allow spaces in coprocessor conf (aka trim() className)
Description:
This is annoying especially for coprocessors where you've long class name.
but maybe is a bug of Configuration.getStrings() that doesn't trim each string.
When you've comma separated values like in the coprocessors case, you've to pack together your values without spaces ("v1,v2,v3,...") otherwise the coprocessor is not loaded because the class name with spaces is not found.
