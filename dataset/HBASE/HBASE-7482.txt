Summary:
Port HBASE-7442 HBase remote CopyTable not working when security enabled to trunk
Description:
Excerpt about the choice of solution from :
The first option was actually quite messy to implement. clusterId and conf are fixed in HBaseClient when it's created and cached by SecureRpcEngine, so to implement the fix here I would have had to pass the different cluster confs up through HConnectionManager and HBaseRPC in order to override the clusterId in SecureClient#SecureConnection.
I've gone with the second option of creating and caching different SecureClients for the local and remote clusters in SecureRpcEngine - keyed off of the clusterId instead of the default SocketFactory. I think this is a cleaner solution.
