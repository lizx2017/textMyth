Summary:
[hbase] Compaction cleanup; less deleting + prevent possible file leaks
Description:
This issue is being created so I can commit the compaction patch that just passed hudson over in HADOOP-2283. That issue is about trouble accessing hdfs. It should stay open since haven't yet figured whats up. As a by-product of the investigation, the compaction patch was generated.
