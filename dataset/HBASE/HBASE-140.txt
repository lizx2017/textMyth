Summary:
[hbase] Fix assertion failures in TestTableMapReduce
Description:
TestTableMapReduce consists of two tests: a very simple one that verifies that it is working, and a larger test that verifies that it works when the table consists of multiple regions.
There are two failure modes:
1) an assertion failure in the verify method
2) the test times out because something does not shut down cleanly.
to figure out what is causing these failures, the first step will be to do copious logging in the test. Once the root cause is determined, we can address it.
Unfortunately, some of the testing will have to be done via Hudson, because that is the only environment in which it fails. We routinely test under Windows, Fedora Core 6, MacOsX, and Ubuntu. Windows and Ubuntu have both single and dual processor configurations. FC6 and MacOS run on dual core machines.
Only Hudson seems crippled enough to demonstrate these problems. (A good thing since they are real problems)
