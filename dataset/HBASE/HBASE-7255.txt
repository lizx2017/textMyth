Summary:
KV size metric went missing from StoreScanner.
Description:
In trunk due to the metric refactor, at least the KV size metric went missing.
See this code in StoreScanner.java:
    } finally {
      if (cumulativeMetric > 0 && metric != null) {

      }
    }
Just an empty if statement, where the metric used to be collected.
