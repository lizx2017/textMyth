Summary:
HLog tool documentation should be updated to use FSHLog for trunk and 0.95.
Description:
The WAL tool section in the hbase book suggests
$ ./bin/hbase org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.wal.HLog --dump hdfs://example.org:8020/hbase/.logs/example.org,60020,1283516293161/10.10.21.10%3A60020.1283973724012
but in trunk HLog is an interface and FSHLog is the implementation. The doc has to be updated accordingly. Even if we don't do this now we have to when the trunk version gets released.
