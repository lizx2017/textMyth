Summary:
Client with cached region location pointing at dead server does not recover
Description:
Testing in HBASE-1908 uncovered an issue where I had a client that had cached a region location. I killed that regionserver, waited for recovery/reassignment, and then tried to scan the table again from the same client w/o restarting it.
A client normally gets a NotServingRegionException when a region is reassigned, but since this server is dead the client just got Connection Refused type exceptions. These didn't seem to trigger the client to ask META for a new region location.
