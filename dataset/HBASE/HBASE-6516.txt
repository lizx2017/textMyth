Summary:
hbck cannot detect any IOException while ".tableinfo" file is missing
Description:
HBaseFsck checks those missing .tableinfo files in loadHdfsRegionInfos() function. However, no IoException will be catched while .tableinfo is missing, since "FSTableDescriptors.getTableDescriptor" doesn't throw any IoException.
