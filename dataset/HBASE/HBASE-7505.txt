Summary:
Server will hang when stopping cluster, caused by waiting for split threads
Description:
We will retry 100 times (about 3200 minitues) for HRegionServer#postOpenDeployTasks now, see HConnectionManager#setServerSideHConnectionRetries.
However,
when we stopping the cluster, we will wait for split threads in HRegionServer#join,
if META/ROOT server has already been stopped, the split thread won't exit because it is in the retrying for HRegionServer#postOpenDeployTasks
