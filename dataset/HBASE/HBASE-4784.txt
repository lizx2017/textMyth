Summary:
Void return types not handled correctly for CoprocessorProtocol methods
Description:
If a CoprocessorProtocol derived interface defines a method with a void return type, the method cannot be called using HTable.coprocessorExec(). Instead ExecResult will throw an IOException on the client trying to do a Class.forName() on "void".
Looking at ExecResult, it appears that the valueType field (which causes the error) is no longer even used, so I'd suggest we just get rid of it.
