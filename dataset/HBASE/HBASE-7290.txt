Summary:
Online snapshots
Description:
HBASE-6055 will be closed when the offline snapshots pieces get merged with trunk. This umbrella issue has all the online snapshot specific patches. This will get merged once one of the implementations makes it into trunk. Other flavors of online snapshots can then be done as normal patches instead of on a development branch.
