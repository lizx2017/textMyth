Summary:
Consolidate HRegion creation/opening API
Description:
Currently we have 4 ways to instantiate an HRegion.
HRegion.createHRegion()
HRegion.openHRegion()
HRegion.newHRegion() + r.initialize()
new HRegion() + r.initialize()
Aside from tests and HMerge and SplitTransaction code everyone use createHRegion() and openHRegion(). To avoid errors due to missing initialization calls I think we should limit the access to newHRegion() and the constructor.
