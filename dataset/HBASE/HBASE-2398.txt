Summary:
NPE in HLog.append when calling writer.getLength
Description:
Doing some test uploads on a fresh single node setup, I'm seeing non-fatal NPEs in the region server log coming from HLog.append when calling writer.getLength. I'll post a log in a follow-up comment.
Assigning to Nicolas so that he takes a look.
