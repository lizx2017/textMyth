Summary:
DistributedLogSplitter failing to split file because it has edits for lots of regions
Description:
Testing 0.92.0RC, ran into interesting issue where a log file had edits for many regions and just opening the file per region was taking so long, we were never updating our progress and so the split of the log just kept failing; in this case, the first 40 edits in a file required our opening 35 files â€“ opening 35 files took longer than the hard-coded 25 seconds its supposed to take "acquiring" the task.
First, here is master's view:

Master then gives it elsewhere.
Over on the regionserver we see:
