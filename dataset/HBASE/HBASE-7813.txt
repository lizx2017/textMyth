Summary:
Bug in BulkDeleteEndpoint kills entire rows on COLUMN/VERSION Deletes
Description:
Try a BulkDeleteEndpoint using DeleteType.COLUMN or DeleteType.VERSION and give it a set of Columns which are not in the row.
A Delete is constructed using just the row alone. No family/column/version is added and it is applied, thus deleting the entire row.
