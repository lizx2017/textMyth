Summary:
HBASE-2283 removed bulk sync optimization for multi-row puts
Description:
previously to HBASE-2283 we used to call flush/sync once per put(Put[]) call (ie: batch of commits). Now we do for every row.
This makes bulk uploads slower if you are using WAL. Is there an acceptable solution to achieve both safety and performance by bulk-sync'ing puts? Or would this not work in face of atomic guarantees?
discuss!
