Summary:
Master restart on create table with splitkeys does not recreate table with all the splitkey regions
Description:
-> Create table using splitkeys
-> MAster goes down before all regions are added to meta
-> On master restart the table is again enabled but with less number of regions than specified in splitkeys
Anyway client will get an exception if i had called sync create table. But table exists or not check will say table exists.
Is this scenario to be handled by client only or can we have some mechanism on the master side for this? Pls suggest.
