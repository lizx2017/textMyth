Summary:
Unnecessary KV order check in StoreScanner
Description:
In StoreScanner.next(List<KeyValue>, int, String) I find this code:
      // Check that the heap gives us KVs in an increasing order.
      if (prevKV != null && comparator != null
          && comparator.compare(prevKV, kv) > 0) {
        throw new IOException("Key " + prevKV + " followed by a " +
            "smaller key " + kv + " in cf " + store);
      }
      prevKV = kv;
So this checks for bugs in the HFiles or the scanner code. It needs to compare each KVs with its predecessor. This seems unnecessary now, I propose that we remove this.
