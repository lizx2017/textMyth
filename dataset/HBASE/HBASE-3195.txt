Summary:
Fix the new TestTransform breakage up on hudson
Description:
This new test has been failing up on hudson since it was introduce at #1606. I took a look. It looks reasonable but its failing in an odd way â€“ can't find blocks in hdfs.
I'm moving it aside for now till test gets some loving. Breakage lasted till at least #1613.
