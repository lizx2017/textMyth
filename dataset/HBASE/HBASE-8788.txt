Summary:
Edit of .proto files moving classes to better homes
Description:
A client wants to hook up to hbase and make use of our .proto files. On review, our .proto files are a little messy: the filter proto is in the hbase.proto file rather than in filter.protos, the server/regionload stuff is in hbase.proto rather than in cluster.status, etc.
