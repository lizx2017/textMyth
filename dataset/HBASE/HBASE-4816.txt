Summary:
Regionserver wouldn't go down because split happened exactly at same time we issued bulk user region close call on our way out
Description:
A regionserver wouldn't go down because it was waiting on a user region to close only the user-space region had just been opened as part of a split transaction – it was a new daughter – just as we'd issued the bulk close to all user regions on receipt of a cluster shutdown call.
We need to add a check for this condition – user tables that did not get the close.
