Summary:
HConstants.MAX_ROW_LENGTH is incorrectly 64k, should be 32k
Description:
the max length of a row has to fit into a signed short. That is 32k. The constant is incorrect, but in the depths of KeyValue it does the right thing:
if (rlength > Short.MAX_VALUE)
{ throw new IllegalArgumentException("Row > " + Short.MAX_VALUE); }
so your Put wont fail and instead it will fail in the KeyValue constructor. So far only that 1 line in Put uses this constant, but we should have a correct value here.
