Summary:
hbase shell translate_hbase_exceptions() rely on table name as first argument
Description:
shell/commands.rb translate_hbase_exceptions() rely on the fact that the table name is the first argument.
This is true for many of the commands but for example:
grant(user, rights, table_name, family=nil, qualifier=nil
revoke(user, table_name, family=nil, qualifier=nil)
has user as first argument, so if you specify a table that doesn't exists, or where you don't have access you end up with a message like "Unknown table
{username}
" and so on...
