Summary:
Fix error handling in get(List<Get> gets)
Description:
See HBASE-3634 for details. The get(List<Get> gets) call needs to catch (or rather use a try/finally) the exception thrown by batch() and copy the Result instances over and return it. If that is not intended then we need to fix the JavaDoc in HTableInterface to reflect the new behavior.
In general it seems to make sense to check the various methods (list based put, get, delete compared to batch) and agree on the correct behavior.
