Summary:
TestHLog.testSplit failing in trunk
Description:
Build is broke because this test won't pass.
Seems to be two issues at least:
1. we need to change the test so it keeps logs in one subdir, archives in another and split products in yet another as per regionserver. New split code does cleanup of old logs dir if successful. In this test it was removing the created splits so when verify went to run, the log no longer existed
2. The verify of splits tests that sequence numbers are in order. They don't seem to be (the assertion failure was masked by a close reader exception).
