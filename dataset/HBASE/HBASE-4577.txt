Summary:
Region server reports storefileSizeMB bigger than storefileUncompressedSizeMB
Description:
Minor issue while looking at the RS metrics:
numberOfStorefiles=8, storefileUncompressedSizeMB=2418, storefileSizeMB=2420, compressionRatio=1.0008
I guess there's a truncation somewhere when it's adding the numbers up.
FWIW there's no compression on that table.
