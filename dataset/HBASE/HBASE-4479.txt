Summary:
TestMasterFailover failure in Hbase-0.92#17
Description:
When the master restarted it was not able to get any servers online and the restart was a clean restart.
Hence there were no regions to assign.
Hence the retainAssignment tries to get one of the regions and uses RANDOM.getInt(size). Here size is 0.
So ideally 0 is not accepted here. Hence we have got an exception making the master not to come up and the test case timeout.
Though we need to see if really no regions was expected when the master came up, but this JIRA's intent is to deal such scenario where the size can be 0.
