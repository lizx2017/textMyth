Summary:
[hbase] HTable API should use interfaces instead of concrete classes as method parameters and return values
Description:
Currently the HTable API uses concrete classes instead of interfaces, for example, TreeMap instead of SortedMap or Map. The API should be revised to use interfaces instead so that clients and the implementation is not bound to a specific concrete class.
