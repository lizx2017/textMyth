Summary:
RowCounter may return incorrect result if column name is specified in command line
Description:
The RowCounter use FirstKeyOnlyFilter regardless of whether or not the
command line argument specified a column family (or family:qualifier).
In case when no qualifier was specified as argument, the scan will
give correct result. However in the other case the scan instance may
have been set with columns other than the very first column in the
row, causing scan to get nothing as the FirstKeyOnlyFilter removes
everything else.
