Summary:
Inconsistent/wrong treatment of timestamp parameters in the old Thrift API
Description:
The old Thrift API treats timestamps wrong/inconsistent.
getRowTs should return a specific version or null if that doesn't exist. Currently it does seem to treat the timestamp as exclusive so the row is not found. Same goes for getVerTs but there it might only be a documentation problem.
I'll go through the old API and will try to find any such problems and correct them in a way that is consistent with the Java API where possible.
Peter Falk reported this on the mailing list. Thanks!
