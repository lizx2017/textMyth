Summary:
UI should not use InfoPort to list servers
Description:
When disabling the info port (setting it to -1) while running more than one RegionServer daemon on the same machine, the UI pages are getting confused/confusing. They list servers by <hostname/info-port> but since both instances use "-1" it shows incoherent info. The UI should always use the <hostname/rpc-port> to list the servers.
