Summary:
HBase client does not get privileges necessary to execute in security manager environment
Description:
HBase does not get privileges to run access controlled code, such as when using Sockets.
------------------------------------------
A DataNucleus, HBase user posted this:
http://www.jpox.org/servlet/forum/viewthread_thread,5869
He is having trouble to run DataNucleus HBase in a JVM running with
security manager activated.
The permission required for the codebase is a SocketPermission,
however the HBase client api does not run in a privileged block.
To workaround we've added the doPrivileged block in DataNucleus, and
the user grants datanucleus-hbase jar the SocketPermission.
However, I think you should add these doPrivileged blocks to HBase
code. Could you please look at these, and let me know when it's
solved, so we can remove the doPrivileged blocks from DataNucleus
code?
