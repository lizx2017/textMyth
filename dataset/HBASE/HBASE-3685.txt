Summary:
when multiple columns are combined with TimestampFilter, only one column is returned
Description:
As reported by an Hbase user:
"I have a ThreadMetadata column family, and there are two columns in it: v12:th: and v12:me. The following code only returns v12:me
get.addColumn(Bytes.toBytes("ThreadMetadata"), Bytes.toBytes("v12:th:");
get.addColumn(Bytes.toBytes("ThreadMetadata"), Bytes.toBytes("v12:me:");
List<Long> threadIds = new ArrayList<Long>();
threadIds.add(10709L);
TimestampFilter filter = new TimestampFilter(threadIds);
get.setFilter(filter);
get.setMaxVersions();
Result result = table.get(get);
I checked hbase for the key/value, they are present. Also other combinations like no timestampfilter, it returns both."
Kannan was able to do a small repro of the issue and commented that if we drop the get.setMaxVersions(), then the problem goes away.
