Summary:
Master may assign META region twice to two regionservers when regionserver is closed and started repeatedly in short time
Description:
In the following case:
1.first,kill all the regionservers
2.then, start all the regionservers immediately
3.then, kill all the regionservers immediately
4.then, start all the regionservers immediately
Master may assign META region twice , and make two regionserver carrying META region.
Through logs, we find that:
Before 1, Regionserver A carrys the META region,
Between 2 and 3 , master receives Regionserver A startup message and is ready to assign meta region to Regionserver B
But, it fails because of 3, and then reassign meta region to Regionserver C,Then ,it is successful after 4,
when 4 , Regionserver C is started earlier than Regionserver A , and Regionserver A is started earlier than Regionserver C successfully online the META region. Therefore, when master receives Regionserver A startup message in 4, it consider Regionserver A carryed META region through CatalogTracker and create a MetaServerShutdownHandler
In MetaServerShutdownHandler's process(), after completing split hlog, Regionserver C has already onlined META region,
however it will execute the following code all the same where isCarryingMeta() return true :
if (isCarryingMeta())this.services.getAssignmentManager().assignMeta();
After that, META region will online on two regionservers
In order to prevent it , we should verify meta region location before assign Meta region .
