Summary:
Thread contention over row locks set monitor
Description:
HRegion maintains a set of row locks. Whenever any thread attempts to lock or release a row it needs to acquire the monitor on that set. We've been encountering cases with 30 handler threads all contending for that monitor, blocked progress on the region server. Clients timeout, and retry making it worse, and the region server stops responding to new clients almost entirely.
