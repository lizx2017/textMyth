Summary:
Pair does not deep check arrays for equality.
Description:
Pair does not deep check arrays for equality. It merely does x.equals for the sent Object. However, with any type of array this is merely going to compare the array pointers, rather than the underlying data structure.
It requires a rewriting of the private equals method in Pair to check for elements being an array, then checking the underlying elements.
