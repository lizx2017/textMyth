Summary:
Master startup is too slow on HBase trunk
Description:
When I start the HBase trunk master on my five-node cluster, it gets stuck in the state "initializing master service threads" for a minute or two, then "waiting for regionserver number to settle", and only then starts log splitting. We don't have such delays in the 0.89-fb master, and I believe we can optimize the new master to eliminate these delays as well.
