Summary:
Store build version in hbase-default and verify at runtime
Description:
This is a second attempt at HBASE-3470 (now reverted) which didn't work properly at MR job submission time since MR unjars the job jar into /tmp when submitting.
This new JIRA will store the hbase version inside hbase-default, and at runtime verify that the hbase-default matches the version of the code.
