Summary:
Broken formatting in LRU stats output
Description:
I've seen this a few times - the output for LRU stats ends up with some invalid characters in it:
11/03/03 14:36:06 DEBUG hfile.LruBlockCache: LRU Stats: total=1.49 MB, free=180.56 MB, max=182.05 MB, blocks=0, accesses=0, hits=0, hitRatio=ï¿½%, cachingAccesses=0, cachingHits=0, cachingHitsRatio=ï¿½%, evictions=0, evicted=0, evictedPerRun=NaN
Note the messed up "hitRatio" and "cachingHitsRatio". I can't figure out how to reproduce, though.
