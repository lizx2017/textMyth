Summary:
[89-fb] Scan unassigned region directory on master failover
Description:
In case the master dies after a regionserver writes region state as OPENED or CLOSED in ZK but before the update is received by master and written to meta, the new master that comes up has to pick up the region state from ZK and write it to meta. Otherwise we can get multiply-assigned regions.
