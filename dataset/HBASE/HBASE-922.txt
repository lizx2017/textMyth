Summary:
Bloom filters will not work if enabled after table is created and contains data
Description:
Currently it is possible to enable a bloom filter after a table is created and data has been stored in it by disabling the table and modifying the column.
While this correctly sets the attribute in the column descriptor, it does not create bloom filters for existing data so that on the first compaction, an NPE will be thrown because the HStore expects each HStoreFile to have a bloom filter.
