Summary:
[0.92 UNIT TESTS] TestMasterObserver.testRegionTransitionOperations fails occasionally
Description:
I have seen a hudson run failing with TestMasterObserver.testRegionTransitionOperations failing. The logs (http://bit.ly/Q5PiVJ) seemed to indicate that
 HMaster.move 
was called on a region that was under transition, and the master's assignment manager at that time didn't have information about the region.
