Summary:
[monitor] Ganglia metric hbase.master.cluster_requests should exclude the scan meta request generated by master, or create a new metric which could show the real request from client
Description:
We have a big table which have 30k regions but the request is not very high (about 50K per day).
We use the hbase.master.cluster_request metrics to monitor the cluster request but find that lots of requests is generated by master, which scan the meta table at regular intervals.
It is hard for us to monitor the real request from the client, it is possible to filter the scanning meta table or create a new metric which could show the real request from client.
Thank you.
