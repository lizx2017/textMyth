Summary:
ColumnPaginationFilter doesn't return the requested number of columns
Description:
The ColumnPaginationFilter doesn't return the correct number of columns when the limit is less than the total number of columns. I don't know much about the internals of Hbase, but it appears that the problem is more re-producible when a table is split accross at least 2 regions. I have created a unit test which can re-produce the issue which is now attached.
