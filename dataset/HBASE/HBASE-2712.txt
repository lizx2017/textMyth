Summary:
Cached region location that went stale won't recover if asking for first row
Description:
Let's say that:
A client cached the location of some region, not the first one in the table
The RS that was holding it fails
The first thing the client does after the failure is trying to reach the first row of that region
This will never recover, since HCM.deleteCachedLocation doesn't delete if the row we asked for is the first row in a region. This looks a lot like HBASE-1920, but there isn't enough information in that jira to say that it's the same thing.
This is a blocker, and it kills 0.20.5 RC2 (sorry).
