Summary:
distributed log splitting can get indefinitely stuck
Description:
After the configured number of retries SplitLogManager is not going to resubmit log-split tasks. In this situation even if the splitLogWorker that owns the task dies the task will not get resubmitted.
When a regionserver goes away then all the split-log tasks that it owned should be resubmitted by the SplitLogMaster.
