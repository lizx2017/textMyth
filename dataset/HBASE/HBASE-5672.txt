Summary:
TestLruBlockCache#testBackgroundEvictionThread fails occasionally
Description:
We find TestLruBlockCache#testBackgroundEvictionThread fails occasionally.
I think it's a problem of the test case.
Because runEviction() only do evictionThread.evict():
public void evict() {
      synchronized(this) {
        this.notify(); // FindBugs NN_NAKED_NOTIFY
      }
    }
However when we call evictionThread.evict(), the evictionThread may haven't been in run() in the TestLruBlockCache#testBackgroundEvictionThread.
If we run the test many times, we could find failture easily.
