Summary:
Compile against hadoop 0.24-SNAPSHOT
Description:
Need to compile hbase against the latest hadoop trunk which just had NN HA merged in.
1) add a hadoop 0.24 profile
2) HBASE-5480
3) HADOOP-8124 removed deprecated Syncable.sync(). It brings compile errors for hbase against hadoop trunk(0.24). TestHLogSplit and TestHLog still call the deprecated sync(). Need to replace it with hflush() so the compilation can pass.
