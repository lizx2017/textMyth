Summary:
[hbase] Fix build failures in TestHBaseCluster
Description:
TestHBaseCluster has been failing occasionally in nightly and patch builds. It appears that a scanner gets created before all the previous writes have made it to the memcache (and consequently, the scanner's memcache snapshot does not contain them).
