Summary:
jmx bean layout makes no sense
Description:
Top level is 'hadoop' Under 'hadoop', there is 'HBase' MBean. BESIDE this MBean is one named Master and another named RegionServer. It makes no sense.
Top level should be org.apache.hbase. Inside there should be an MBean per running server. It should be the server's ServerName, not 'Master' or 'RegionServer'.
Under RegionServer there is a RegionServer bean [sic], then beside it a RegionServerStatistics and a RegionServerDynamicStatistics.
I'd think that as they are, they are unusable.
