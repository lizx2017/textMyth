Summary:
CleanerChore checkAndDeleteDirectory not deleting empty directories
Description:
CleanerChore checkAndDeleteDirectory is not deleting empty directories. As a result, some directories are kept in the FS but should have been removed.
To reproduce, simply create an empty directory under /hbase/.archive/table_name/. If you place a file into this directory, it's not more empty and therefore it's correctly removed.
