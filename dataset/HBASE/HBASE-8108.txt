Summary:
Add m2eclispe lifecycle mapping to hbase-common
Description:
The maven-antrun-plugin execution doesn't have a default mapping in m2eclipse, so if you import the project into eclipse, you will get an error that the mapping is undefined. All that's needed is to define an execution via the org.eclipse.m2 lifecycle-mapping plugin - it doesn't actually affect the usual maven build at all.
