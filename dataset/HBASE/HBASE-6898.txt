Summary:
Use branch to host custom build artifacts
Description:
Based on conversation here: http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/hbase-dev/201209.mbox/%3CCAPcDmSvS-MpZLGXU0gpYUYz9JoqghcZEngML_JYEtWPCXhYvAw%40mail.gmail.com%3E
In short, we should have a single, committer accessible and audit-able place to store custom build artifacts for HBase.
Occasionally, we need to build custom artifacts for HBase that haven't made it into the upstream projects. In the past we have hosted them in various committer's people.apache.org/ publicly visible object hosting sites (which just need a certain file structure to work as maven repositories). While the best course of action is to get the upstream projects to release a version with the change we require, this is not always possible immediately and for the short term we need the modified artifact.
This ticket would add a branch to the hbase source and update the pom to point to the apache visible svn tree to act as the pseudo-maven respositories. This gives us a low friction, auditable, committter accessible place to upload custom build artifacts. They can also be easily removed as the upstream projects release new versions.
