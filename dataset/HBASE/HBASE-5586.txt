Summary:
[replication] NPE in ReplicationSource when creating a stream to an inexistent cluster
Description:
This is from 0.92.1-ish:
2012-03-15 09:52:16,589 ERROR
org.apache.hadoop.hbase.replication.regionserver.ReplicationSource:
Unexpected exception in ReplicationSource, currentPath=null
java.lang.NullPointerException
       at org.apache.hadoop.hbase.replication.regionserver.ReplicationSource.chooseSinks(ReplicationSource.java:223)
       at org.apache.hadoop.hbase.replication.regionserver.ReplicationSource.connectToPeers(ReplicationSource.java:442)
       at org.apache.hadoop.hbase.replication.regionserver.ReplicationSource.run(ReplicationSource.java:246)
I wanted to add a replication stream to a cluster that wasn't existing yet so that the logs would be buffered until then. This should just be treated as if there was no region servers.
