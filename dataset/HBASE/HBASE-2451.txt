Summary:
.META. by-passes cache; BLOCKCACHE=>'false'
Description:
In a new install, if I describe '.META.', it says:
DESCRIPTION                                                             ENABLED                               
 {NAME => '.META.', IS_META => 'true', MEMSTORE_FLUSHSIZE => '16384', F true                                  
 AMILIES => [{NAME => 'historian', COMPRESSION => 'NONE', VERSIONS => '                                       
 2147483647', TTL => '604800', BLOCKSIZE => '8192', IN_MEMORY => 'false                                       
 ', BLOCKCACHE => 'false'}, {NAME => 'info', COMPRESSION => 'NONE', VER                                       
 SIONS => '10', TTL => '2147483647', BLOCKSIZE => '8192', IN_MEMORY =>                                        
 'false', BLOCKCACHE => 'true'}]} 
BLOCKCACHE is 'true' for the 'info' family (Yes historian is still in 0.20 branch).
But, if I add logging to hfile and storefile and store, blockcache is 'false' â€“ there is no cache constructed for use by the hfile.
This is killing cluster performance.
It looks like a problem parsing the 'true' value in columnfamily. I'll put up a patch in the morning. Meantime, marking as blocker on 0.20.4.
