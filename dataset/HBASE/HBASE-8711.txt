Summary:
Requests count is completely off
Description:
I tried 0.95.1 RC1 in standalone, and the requests count in both the master and RS web UIs are wrong. I haven't dug too much in but it seems too low when I'm sending load, and it takes >10 seconds to clear up when the cluster becomes completely idle.
