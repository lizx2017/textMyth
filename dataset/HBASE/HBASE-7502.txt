Summary:
TestScannerTimeout fails on snapshot branch
Description:
TestScannerTimeout#test3686a fails consistently on snapshot branch. This is because there is an increase in the number of watches on the rs znode and its deletion takes more time now. The repercussion is that when test3686a starts, it ensures that there are two regionservers and it counts the aborted regionserver as a live one. While processing, it kills one of its server, and also the znode of the previously aborted server expires. Overall effect is there are no regionservers now, and client hangs.
