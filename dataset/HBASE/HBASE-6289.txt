Summary:
ROOT region doesn't get re-assigned in ServerShutdownHandler if the RS is still working but only the RS's ZK node expires.
Description:
The ROOT RS has some network problem and its ZK node expires first, which kicks off the ServerShutdownHandler. it calls verifyAndAssignRoot() to try to re-assign ROOT. At that time, the RS is actually still working and passes the verifyRootRegionLocation() check, so the ROOT region is skipped from re-assignment.
  private void verifyAndAssignRoot()
  throws InterruptedException, IOException, KeeperException {
    long timeout = this.server.getConfiguration().
      getLong("hbase.catalog.verification.timeout", 1000);
    if (!this.server.getCatalogTracker().verifyRootRegionLocation(timeout)) {
      this.services.getAssignmentManager().assignRoot();
    }
  }
After a few moments, this RS encounters DFS write problem and decides to abort. The RS then soon gets restarted from commandline, and constantly report:
