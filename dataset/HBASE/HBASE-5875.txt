Summary:
Process RIT and Master restart may remove an online server considering it as a dead server
Description:
If on master restart it finds the ROOT/META to be in RIT state, master tries to assign the ROOT region through ProcessRIT.
Master will trigger the assignment and next will try to verify the Root Region Location.
Root region location verification is done seeing if the RS has the region in its online list.
If the master triggered assignment has not yet been completed in RS then the verify root region location will fail.
Because it failed
splitLogAndExpireIfOnline(currentRootServer);
we do split log and also remove the server from online server list. Ideally here there is nothing to do in splitlog as no region server was restarted.
So master, though the server is online, master just invalidates the region server.
In a special case, if i have only one RS then my cluster will become non operative.
