Summary:
Column family and qualifier should be allowed to be set as null in grant shell command
Description:
In 0.94, grant.rb has the following:
Grant users specific rights.
Syntax : grant <user> <permissions> [<table> [<column family> [<column qualifier>]]
In 0.95.2, when I tried to grant permission on a table to user hrt_1, I got some exception:
hbase(main):003:0> grant 'hrt_1', 'R', 't1'

ERROR: java.lang.NullPointerException: null

Here is some help for this command:
Grant users specific rights.
Syntax : grant <user> <permissions> <table> <column family> <column qualifier>

permissions is either zero or more letters from the set "RWXCA".
READ('R'), WRITE('W'), EXEC('X'), CREATE('C'), ADMIN('A')

For example:

    hbase> grant 'bobsmith', 'RWXCA'
    hbase> grant 'bobsmith', 'RW', 't1', 'f1', 'col1'
