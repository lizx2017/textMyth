Summary:
Ability to batch edits destined to different regions
Description:
The old (pre-PB) "multi" and "multiPut" RPCs allowed one to batch edits destined to different regions. Seems like we've lost this ability after the switch to protobufs.
The MultiRequest only contains one RegionSpecifier, and a list of MultiAction. The MultiAction message is contains either a single MutationProto or a Get (but not both â€“ so its name is misleading as there is nothing "multi" about it). Also it seems redundant with MultiGetRequest, I'm not sure what's the point of supporting Get in MultiAction.
I propose that we change MultiRequest to be a just a list of MultiAction, and MultiAction will contain the RegionSpecifier, the bool atomic and a list of MutationProto. This would be a non-backward compatible protobuf change.
If we want we can support mixing edits and reads, in which case we'd also add a list of Get in MultiAction, and we'd have support having both that list and the list of MutationProto set at the same time. But this is a bonus and can be done later (in a backward compatible manner, hence no need to rush on this one).
