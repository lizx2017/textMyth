Summary:
HBASE-1551 broke the ability to manage non-regionserver start-up/shut down. ie: you cant start/stop thrift on a cluster anymore
Description:
I used to be able to do:
bin/hbase-daemons.sh stop thrift
bin/hbase-daemons.sh start thrift
I can't anymore. We can't manage anything but regionservers and zookeeper with this script now.
