Summary:
unsychronized logWriters map is mutated from several threads in HLog splitting
Description:
In splitLog, the logWriters map is an unsynchronized collection, and the spawned threads mutate it. In practice I've now seen several times a situation where one of the puts into this map is lost, and a thread ends up renaming a file it's in the process of writing to, causing those edits to be lost when the log is split.
