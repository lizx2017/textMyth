Summary:
hbase shell needs to warn on deleting multi-region table
Description:
if a multi-region table is deleted, then re-created, the old regions in the storefiles can interfere with the new table. to fix this, a major compaction should be issued before loading the new table. the shell should warn people of this so we don't end up with unhappy users.
