Summary:
Master retry on ZK session expiry causes inconsistent region assignments.
Description:
1> ZK Session timeout in the hmaster leads to bulk assignment though all the RSs are online.
2> While doing bulk assignment, if the master again goes down & restart(or backup comes up) all the node created in the ZK will now be tried to reassign to the new RSs. This is leading to double assignment.
we had 2800 regions, among this 1900 region got double assignment, taking the region count to 4700.
