Summary:
"Table '.META.' does not exist." in trunk
Description:
I attempted to try out HBASE-458, and discovered that I couldn't create a table in shell at all on a fresh trunk.
hql > show tables;
error msg : org.apache.hadoop.hbase.TableNotFoundException: Table '.META.' does not exist.
I tried wiping out my dfs to see if that made a difference, and it didn't.
This is a big problem.
