Summary:
Timestamp mismatch between WAL and MemStore for ICVs
Description:
We've been running replication for a little while now and the tool I wrote to verify replicated data (will be posted in HBASE-3013) works great, unless that data is counters. The reason is that in HRegion.incrementColumnValue we append to the WAL a KV with a timestamp that we're not reusing for the MemStore (since we do some processing on it in updateColumnValue), so the replicated KV is different and comparing sets of rows using time ranges usually fails because one row will almost surely be cut in half on the edges (at least this is what my testing shows).
I guess this is also an issue on the slave cluster since if we don't want values on the same ts on the master cluster, why would we want it elsewhere?
