Summary:
Setters of class HTableDescriptor do not work properly
Description:
Setters "setName()" and "setDeferredLogFlush()" do not work properly because for example after calling setName() the internal property nameAsString is not modified and then if you call getNameAsString() you get the previous value and not the new one. Something similar happens to the setter "setDeferredLogFlush()"
