Summary:
[hbase] Concurrent creates of a table named 'X' all succeed
Description:
If multiple threads all try to create a table of a particular, all succeed. It makes for a mess.
Create table needs to be synchronized so only one thread creates a table and subsequent threads fail with 'table already exits'. The test for pre-existence also needs fixing.
