Summary:
[WINDOWS] MiniZookeeperCluster multiple daemons bind to the same port
Description:
TestHBaseTestingUtility.testMiniZooKeeper() tests whether the mini zk cluster is working by launching 5 threads corresponding to zk servers.
NIOServerCnxnFactory.configure() configures the socket as:
        this.ss = ServerSocketChannel.open();
        ss.socket().setReuseAddress(true);
setReuseAddress() is set, because it allows the server to come back up and bind to the same port before the socket is timed-out by the kernel.
Under windows, the behavior on ServerSocket.setReuseAddress() is different than on linux, in which it allows any process to bind to an already-bound port. This causes ZK nodes starting on the same node, to be able to bind to the same port.
The following part of the patch at https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-8223 deals with this case for Hadoop:
if(Shell.WINDOWS) {
+      // result of setting the SO_REUSEADDR flag is different on Windows
+      // http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms740621(v=vs.85).aspx
+      // without this 2 NN's can start on the same machine and listen on 
+      // the same port with indeterminate routing of incoming requests to them
+      ret.setReuseAddress(false);
+    }
We should do the same in Zookeeper (I'll open a ZOOK issue). But in the meantime, we can fix hbase tests to not rely on BindException to resolve for bind errors. Especially, in MiniZKCluster.startup() when starting more than 1 servers, we already know that we have to increment the port number.
