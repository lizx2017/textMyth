Summary:
TestLogRolling doesn't use the right HLog half the time
Description:
Since HBASE-2868, TestLogRolling uses 2 region servers instead of 1. The rest of the un-refactored code isn't expecting that, and only used the log from the first RS. This is why we get very inconsistent results. Fix by either coming back to 1 RS or at least use the right HLog.
