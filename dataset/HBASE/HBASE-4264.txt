Summary:
TestMergeTool is too sensitive to hanging HBase cluster from other test
Description:
The TestMergeTool.testMergeTool failure in build 2154 was due to the following check:
      HBaseAdmin.checkHBaseAvailable(getConf());
      LOG.fatal("HBase cluster must be off-line.");
HBase cluster from some other test(s) was hanging since "merging regions 0 and 1" is the first merge.
The test can be made more robust by calling HBaseAdmin.shutdown() before making the first merge.
In Merge.java, -1 is returned in 5 places. I think we should return different values so that it is more obvious what the cause was.
