Summary:
Generalize ServerCallable creation to support custom callables
Description:
Currently, sever callables are instantiated via direct calls. Instead, we can use a single factory and that allows more specialized callable implementations, for instance, using a circuit-breaker pattern (or the Hystrix implementation!) to minimize attempts to contact the server.
