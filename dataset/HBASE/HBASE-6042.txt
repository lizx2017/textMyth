Summary:
FirstKeyOnlyFilter does not work in conjunction with getColumns()
Description:
Given the implementation of ScanQueryMatcher, we check
filter.filterKeyValue()
before determining weather we are going to include the KV in the
result or not. Thus, if the scan/get were to specify columns other
than the very first column in the row, they get nothing because
the filter removes everything else.
