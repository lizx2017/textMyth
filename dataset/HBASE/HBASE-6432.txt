Summary:
HRegionServer doesn't properly set clusterId in conf
Description:
ClusterId is normally set into the passed conf during instantiation of an HTable class. In the case of a HRegionServer this is bypassed and set to "default" since getMaster() since it uses HBaseRPC to create the proxy directly and bypasses the class which retrieves and sets the correct clusterId.
This becomes a problem with clients (ie within a coprocessor) using delegation tokens for authentication. Since the token's service will be the correct clusterId and while the TokenSelector is looking for one with service "default".
