Summary:
HBaseAdmin::isTableAvailable( name ) returns true when the table does not exist
Description:
HBaseAdmin::isTableAvailable( name ) returns true for a table in which HBaseAdmin::tableExists( name ) returns false.
It appears from the code that the default return value from isTableAvailable() is true and false is only returned in the case where the table is found and not all the region servers are online.
