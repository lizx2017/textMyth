Summary:
Wiki Thrift Documentation For Scan Methods
Description:
The documentation on the Wiki for the Scan methods in Thrift are wrong. The wiki page is http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/Hbase/ThriftApi. The openScanner, getScannerResult and closeScanner methods aren't methods in the Thrift interface. They should be scannerOpen, scannerGet, and scannerClose. Some of the method paramaters might need to be changed too.
