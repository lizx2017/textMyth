Summary:
BaseRegionObserver#pre(Compact|Flush|Store)ScannerOpen returns null
Description:
As pointed out in https://github.com/forcedotcom/phoenix/pull/131, BaseRegionObserver#preCompactScannerOpen returns null by default, which hoses any coprocessors down the line, making override of this method mandatory. The fix is trivial, patch coming momentarily.
Update:
This same behavior is present in the Flush and Store versions of the same method - this should all be moved to the proposed 'return passed scanner' default behavior.
