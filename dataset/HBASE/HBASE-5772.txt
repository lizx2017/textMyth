Summary:
Unable to open the few links in http://hbase.apache.org/
Description:
Few links in http://hbase.apache.org/ is not working.
For example, Ref Guide (multi-page) will actually link to http://hbase.apache.org/book/book.html and if I try to open this, Page not found error is coming.
If I add /book in the url, like http://hbase.apache.org/book/book/book.html, it is taking me to the Apache HBase Reference Guide
I think the folder structure has been changed.
