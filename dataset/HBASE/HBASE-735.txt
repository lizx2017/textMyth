Summary:
hbase shell doesn't trap CTRL-C signal
Description:
From withing the hbase shell, when there's a IO problem, the hbase client code tries to recover automatically but sometimes we know what's going on and all we want is to cancel the operation by pressing CTRL-C but the shell doesn't catch it and we need to either wait for the operation to timeout or close the terminal and open another one.
