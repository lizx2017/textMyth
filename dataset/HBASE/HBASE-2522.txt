Summary:
Disabling a table during a split (tricky) can leave the daughter regions assigned and marked offline in .META.
Description:
If for any reason the master takes too much time to process a MSG_REPORT_SPLIT_INCLUDES_DAUGHTERS, and that a user successfully disables the table, then the daughter regions will still be assigned and marked as offline in .META.
A test case I'm uploading to HBASE-2515 shows the issue.
