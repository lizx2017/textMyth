Summary:
A corrupt HFile could cause endless attempts to assign the region without a chance of success
Description:
As described in HBASE-9737, a corrupt HFile in a region could lead to an assignment storm in the cluster since the Master will keep trying to assign the region to each region server one after another and obviously none will succeed.
The region server, upon detecting such a scenario should mark the region as "RS_ZK_REGION_FAILED_ERROR" (or something to the effect) in the Zookeeper which should indicate the Master to stop assigning the region until the error has been resolved (via an HBase shell command, probably "assign"?)
