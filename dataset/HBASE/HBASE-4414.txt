Summary:
Region splits by size not being triggered in at least some cases
Description:
We seem to have lost the triggering of region splits by size somewhere in trunk.
Running a simple test to load data only:
1. create 'usertable', 'f1' in hbase shell
2. run a YCSB load of 10M records
I wind up with a single region containing all records, around 13GB, despite max region size being configured to 640MB.
    ip-10-160-217-155.us-west-1.compute.internal:8120 1316045713501
        requestsPerSecond=0, numberOfOnlineRegions=1, usedHeapMB=1544, maxHeapMB=2962
        usertable,,1316045755455.1e11a9f71072113258942e03dabaa468.
            numberOfStores=1, numberOfStorefiles=16, storefileUncompressedSizeMB=13611, storefileSizeMB=13621, compressionRatio=1.0007, memstoreSizeMB=50, storefileIndexSizeMB=0, readRequestsCount=0, writeRequestsCount=1930, rootIndexSizeKB=108, totalStaticIndexSizeKB=10511, totalStaticBloomSizeKB=0, totalCompactingKVs=3356000, currentCompactedKVs=3356000, compactionProgressPct=1.0
As best I can tell, the changes introduced in HBASE-3797 and HBASE-1476 dropped some cases where we were triggering region splits when we didn't compact.
