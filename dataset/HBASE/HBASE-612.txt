Summary:
HColumnDescriptor's readFields() method is version aware but its write() method is not
Description:
HColumnDescriptor's readFields() method is version aware but its write() method is not.
I found this tracing the cause of a NPE in the Master's IPC server processing a region open message where the serialized HColumnDescriptor objects were a version earlier than my latest.
Attached is a patch against trunk which cures the problem.
