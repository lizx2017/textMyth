Summary:
Race between RegionOpenedHandler and AssignmentManager
Description:
When the master is processing a ZK event for REGION_OPENED, it calls delete() on the znode before it removes the node from RegionsInTransition. If the notification of that delete comes back into AssignmentManager before the region is removed from RIT, you see an error like:
2011-08-30 17:43:29,537 WARN [main-EventThread] master.AssignmentManager(861): Node deleted but still in RIT: .META.,,1.1028785192 state=OPEN, ts=1314751409532, server=todd-w510,55655,1314751396840
Not certain if it causes issues, but it's a concerning log message.
