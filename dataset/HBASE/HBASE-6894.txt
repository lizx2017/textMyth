Summary:
Adding metadata to a table in the shell is both arcane and painful
Description:
In production we have hundreds of tables w/ whack names like 'aliaserv', 'ashish_bulk', 'age_gender_topics', etc. It be grand if you could look in master UI and see stuff like owner, eng group responsible, miscellaneous description, etc.
Now, HTD has support for this; each carries a dictionary. Whats a PITA though is adding attributes to the dictionary. Here is what seems to work on trunk (though I do not trust it is doing the right thing):
hbase> create 'SOME_TABLENAME', {NAME => 'd', VERSION => 1, COMPRESSION => 'LZO'}
hbase> # Here is how I added metadata
hbase> disable 'SOME_TABLENAME'
hbase> alter 'SOME_TABLENAME', METHOD => 'table_att', OWNER => 'SOMEON', CONFIG => {'ENVIRONMENT' => 'BLAH BLAH', 'SIZING' => 'The size should be between 0-10K most of the time with new URLs coming in and getting removed as they are processed unless the pipeline has fallen behind', 'MISCELLANEOUS' => 'Holds the list of URLs waiting to be processed in the parked page detection analyzer in ingestion pipeline.'}
...
describe...
enable...
The above doesn't work in 0.94. Complains about the CONFIG, the keyword we are using for the HTD dictionary.
It works in 0.96 though I'd have to poke around some more to ensure it is doing the right thing.
But this METHOD => 'table_att' stuff is really ugly.... can we fix it?
And I can't add table attributes on table create seemingly.
A little bit of thought and a bit of ruby could clean this all up.
