Summary:
[89-fb] Add an option to blacklist a region server
Description:
Add an API to blacklist a region server. The master should not assign any new regions to the blacklisted region server. This will help in Rolling Restart of HBase, where one can blacklist a regionserver, drain all the regions(which should be fast), restart the regionserver, assign the regions backs and then remove the region server from the blacklist
