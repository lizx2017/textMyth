Summary:
Disable table doesn't work reliably
Description:
When creating a couple of tables like this:
1) create an empty table
2) disable table, add new column family, enable table
3) put 100 small documents into newly created column
around once in 10 tries the disable doesn't happen.
I have no clue as to why the table isn't disabled in the first place, but if this occurs, two things in HBaseAdmin.disableTable() strike me as odd:
after numRetries tries to wait for disabling we exit the loop; there is no exception or error message:
...
2008-05-14 16:19:47,903 INFO org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.HBaseAdmin: Disabled table table31
2008-05-14 16:19:47,910 INFO org.apache.hadoop.ipc.Server: IPC Server handler 3 on 60000, call addColumn(table31, {name: document, max versions: 3, compression: NONE, in memory: false, block cache enabled: false, max length: 2147483647, time to live: FOREVER, bloom filter: none}
) from XXX.XX.40.36:47116: error: org.apache.hadoop.hbase.TableNotDisabledException: table31
...
the scanner iterates over HRegionInfos of several tables. If any one of those is disabled, we also leave the loop as if the requested table had been disabled.
I've had this disabling problem occur quite reliably over the last days - today I couldn't reproduce it, though HBase version hasn't changed. ???
