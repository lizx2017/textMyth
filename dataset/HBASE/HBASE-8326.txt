Summary:
mapreduce.TestTableInputFormatScan times out frequently
Description:
It looks like since this change org.apache.hadoop.hbase.mapreduce.TestTableInputFormatScan has not passed a single time in the EC2 builds (http://54.241.6.143/job/HBase-0.94/). Change was introduced in Build #72, since then this tests times out (or doesn't finish)
