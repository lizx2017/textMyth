Summary:
Add hbase contrib lib dir to root build.xml javadoc classpath
Description:
hbase is about to add a lib directory. In here we will add libs needed by hbase but that are not of use to the parent hadoop (e.g. the jline jar to support the pending hbase shell feature).
Editing the hbase build.xml to add the new hbase lib directory to the CLASSPATH works for all targets but 'javadoc'. The javadoc target in the parent hadoop project does not delegate down to the the src/contrib/build.xml file as does compile, test, and clean targets. Even if it did, the javadoc tool does not seem to be amenable to incremental doc generation; it wants all src to hand before it starts to work.
