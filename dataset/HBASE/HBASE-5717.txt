Summary:
Scanner metrics are only reported if you get to the end of a scanner
Description:
When you turn on Scanner Metrics, the metrics are currently only made available if you run over all records available in the scanner. If you stop iterating before the end, the values are never flushed into the metrics object (in the Scan attribute).
Will supply a patch with fix and test.
