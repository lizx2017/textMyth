Summary:
[replication] Remove dead sinks from ReplicationSource.currentPeers and pick new ones
Description:
I happened to look at a log today where I saw a lot lines like this:
2012-12-06 23:29:08,318 INFO org.apache.hadoop.hbase.replication.regionserver.ReplicationSource: Slave cluster looks down: This server is in the failed servers list: sv4r20s49/10.4.20.49:10304

What struck me as weird is this had been going on for some days, I would expect the RS to find new servers if it wasn't able to replicate. But the reality is that only a few of the chosen sink RS were down so eventually the source hits one that's good and is never able to refresh its list of servers.
We should remove the dead servers, it's spammy and probably adds some slave lag.
