Summary:
TableInputFormat does not setup the configuration for HBase mapreduce jobs correctly
Description:
In 0.20.x and earlier TableMapReduceUtil (and other Input/OutputFormat classes) used to setup the HTable with a HBaseConfiguration object, now that has been deprecated in #HBASE-2036 they are constructed with Hadoop configuration objects which do not contain the configuration xml file resources required to setup HBase. I think it is currently expected this is done when constructing the job but as this needs to be done for every HBase mapreduce job it would be cleaner if the TableMapReduceUtil class did this whilst setting up the TableInput/OutputFormat classes.
