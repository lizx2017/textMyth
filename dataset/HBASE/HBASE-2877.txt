Summary:
Unnecessary byte written when serializing a Writable RPC parameter
Description:
When HbaseObjectWritable#writeObject serializes a Writable RPC parameter, it writes its "class code" twice to the wire. writeClassCode is already called once unconditionally at the beginning of the method, and for Writable arguments, it's called a second time towards the end of the method. It seems that the code is trying to deal with the "declared type" vs. "actual type" of a parameter. The Hadoop RPC code was already doing this before Stack changed it to use codes in r608738 for HADOOP-2519. It's not documented when this is useful though, and I couldn't find any use case. Every RPC I've seen so far just ends up with the same byte sent twice to the wire.
