Summary:
Two tables of same name if first with column family A, B, C and second with column family D
Description:
I see two tables of same name in an hbase instance. The first was made with column familes 1, 2, 3. I then dropped that table and made a new one with column family 4. I notice now – or rather Jim Firby noticed – that two tables are showing in the UI, both named the same; one with familes 1, 2, and 3 with the other showing column family 4.
Scanning etc., seems to work properly. Looking on disk, I see one subdir named for the table with all column families under it.
Haven't tried to reproduce.
