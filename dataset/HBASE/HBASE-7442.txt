Summary:
HBase remote CopyTable not working when security enabled
Description:
When security is enabled, HBase CopyTable fails with Kerberos exception:
FATAL org.apache.hadoop.ipc.SecureClient: SASL authentication failed. The most likely cause is missing or invalid credentials. Consider 'kinit'.
javax.security.sasl.SaslException: GSS initiate failed [Caused by GSSException: No valid credentials provided (Mechanism level: Failed to find any Kerberos tgt)]
This is only when copying to remote HBase cluster (using either MRv1 or YARN), local copy works fine.
