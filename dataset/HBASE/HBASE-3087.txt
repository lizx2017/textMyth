Summary:
Metrics are not respecting period configuration
Description:
This was discussed on an email thread and then summarized in a comment from stack over in HBASE-2888 (which is a more broad jira):
Setting hbase.period in hadoop-metrics.properties doesn't seem to have an effect; counts are off. Here's what I noticed digging in code:
'hadoop-metrics.properties' gets read up into a metrics attributes map but nothing seems to be done w/ them subsequently. Reading up in hadoop, in branch-0.20/src/core/org/apache/hadoop/metrics/package.html, it seems to imply that we need to getAttribute and set them after we make a metrics Context; i.e. in this case, call setPeriod in RegionServerMetrics, etc.?
More broadly, need to make sure settings in hadoop-metrics.properties take effect when changed.
