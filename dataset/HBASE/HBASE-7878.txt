Summary:
recoverFileLease does not check return value of recoverLease
Description:
I think this is a problem, so I'm opening a ticket so an HBase person takes a look.
Apache Accumulo has moved its write-ahead log to HDFS. I modeled the lease recovery for Accumulo after HBase's lease recovery. During testing, we experienced data loss. I found it is necessary to wait until recoverLease returns true to know that the file has been truly closed. In FSHDFSUtils, the return result of recoverLease is not checked. In the unit tests created to check lease recovery in HBASE-2645, the return result of recoverLease is always checked.
I think FSHDFSUtils should be modified to check the return result, and wait until it returns true.
