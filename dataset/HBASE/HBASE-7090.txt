Summary:
HMaster#splitLogAndExpireIfOnline actually does it if the server is NOT online
Description:
This has been there for some time. It is a surprise to find it is reversed actually. Did I missing anything?
I think it really means to do it if the server is online.
  private void splitLogAndExpireIfOnline(final ServerName sn)
      throws IOException {
    if (sn == null || !serverManager.isServerOnline(sn)) {
      return;
    }
    LOG.info("Forcing splitLog and expire of " + sn);
    fileSystemManager.splitLog(sn);
    serverManager.expireServer(sn);
  }
