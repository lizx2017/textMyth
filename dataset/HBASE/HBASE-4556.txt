Summary:
Fix all incorrect uses of InternalScanner.next(...)
Description:
There are cases all over the code where InternalScanner.next(...) is not used correctly.
I see this a lot:
while(scanner.next(...)) {
}
The correct pattern is:
boolean more = false;
do {
   more = scanner.next(...);
} while (more);
