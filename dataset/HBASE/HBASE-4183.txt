Summary:
FSUtils checkFileSystem() should not close the FileSystem by default
Description:
The checkFileSystem() function in FSUtils closes down the FileSystem for the HRegionServer by default if the FileSystem is not available. Ideally we should let the the HRegionServer threads exit and then shutdown the FileSystem. The checkFileSystem() function should not by default kill the FileSystem.
