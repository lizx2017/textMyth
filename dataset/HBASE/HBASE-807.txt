Summary:
Lost split meta updates
Description:
Two different clusters suffered loss of meta table updates yesterday. In particular, they both lost knowledge of splits.
The manifestation of the loss was a NPE doing a get of a row that was within the range of the split region:
NativeException: java.lang.NullPointerException: null
    from org/apache/hadoop/hbase/client/ServerCallable.java:64:in `getServerName'
    from org/apache/hadoop/hbase/client/HConnectionManager.java:900:in `getRegionServerWithRetries'
    from org/apache/hadoop/hbase/client/HTable.java:467:in `get'
    from org/apache/hadoop/hbase/client/HTable.java:449:in `get'
...
Digging in, a ghost of the daughter regions remained down in .META. store files in the form of region historian updates.
On one cluster, there was an HDFS storm where HDFS was badly abused trying to make it work. On the other, original data was written with RC1 which had lots of issues. For now, let the HDFS storm and the fact that the data was written with RC1 'explain' the loss... but lets keep an eye out in case we see this issue again.
