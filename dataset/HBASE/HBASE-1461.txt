Summary:
region assignment can become stale and master doesnt fix it
Description:
I have been playing with ZK recovery and other crash scenarios. There is a very rare but potential bug where a region can be assigned to be open on an existing regionserver, but the regionserver itself doesn't have the region open.
The HMaster should also check the opposite of what it does - make sure that regions assigned to server X are actually open on that server.
