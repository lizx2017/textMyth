Summary:
Can't put with ts in shell
Description:
On the latest branch I can't issue a put with a ts in the shell, it does this:
hbase(main):008:0> put 't', 'r', 'f:', 'test', 123123
NameError: no constructor with arguments matching
 [class org.jruby.java.proxies.ArrayJavaProxy, class org.jruby.RubyFixnum] on 
 object #<Java::OrgApacheHadoopHbaseClient::Put:0x49239780>
It works without a ts and delete/scan aren't affected by this.
