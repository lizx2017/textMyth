Summary:
Store ignores checksum errors when opening files
Description:
If you corrupt one of the storefiles in a region (eg using vim to muck up some bytes), the region will still open, but that storefile will just be ignored with a log message. We should probably not do this in general - better to keep that region unassigned and force an admin to make a decision to remove the bad storefile.
