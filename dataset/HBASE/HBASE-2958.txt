Summary:
When hbase.hlog.split.skip.errors is set to false, we fail the split but thats it
Description:
When hbase.hlog.split.skip.errors is set to false, if we encounter an error splitting, splitting stops and exception is let propagate up the stack. I see that its caught in the new MasterFileSystem class and logged, but thats it. It would seem processing continues BUT we've dropped the edits in the split. We need to do better (default is hbase.hlog.split.skip.errors set to false â€“ i.e. skip errors but keep going).
