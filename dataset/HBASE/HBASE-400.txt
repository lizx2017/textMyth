Summary:
[Hbase Shell] Unit tests for HQL commands implementation
Description:
HQL commands have been implemented through the issue
HADOOP-1720. Unit tests that test these newly
implemented HQL commands are needed to make sure that those commands
are correctly implemented.
In this issue, we are going to provide unit tests that set up a minibase cluster,
execute various commands, and verify the results, as Stack suggested in the issue
HADOOP-1720 as follows:
Stack said:
This is a large amount of new functionality but it is without unit tests. Regression in something as complicated as a shell is a real danger. Do you have any objection to adding at least a basic test that does a setup of a minihbasecluster adding a table using your create command (with assertion that add was successful, and that all options specified were enabled, perhaps using your describe command), and then disable, enable, input, select, and drop asserting each of the steps has happened as you go? (I can help out if you'd like).
