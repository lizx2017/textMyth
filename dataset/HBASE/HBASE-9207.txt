Summary:
An Offline SplitParent Region can be assigned breaking split references
Description:
An offline split parent region can be assigned by using 'assign' from shell.
This may trigger a compaction on the split parent region that should be offline, breaking the references of the two daughters.
The easy way to test this is:
disable compactions
create a table and insert some row
split
shutdown the master (otherwise there's a state checked inside the AssignmentManager)
start the master
assign the region marked as OFFLINE => true, SPLIT => true (the compaction on region startup will probably break the reference of the two daughters)
