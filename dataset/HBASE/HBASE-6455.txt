Summary:
org.apache.hadoop.hbase.PerformanceEvaluation sets the map reduce output path as a child of input path
Description:
I was the running PerformanceEvaluation test with a modified job configuration where the job output path is created before the splits and that unmasked the issue because the the PeInputFormat.getSplits() function expects to find only files under the input path.
The attached patch addresses both the issues.
Creates separate input and output path rooted under a single folder e.g. "<user_home>/performance_evaluation/<yyyyMMddHHmmss>/inputs" and "<user_home>/performance_evaluation/<yyyyMMddHHmmss>/outputs", and
The PeInputFormat.getSplits(), now skips any folder found under the input path and process only files.
