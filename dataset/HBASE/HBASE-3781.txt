Summary:
hbase shell cannot start "NoMethodError: undefined method `close' for nil:NilClass"
Description:
After following the instruction for installing hbase on windows with cygwin, and trying to run the hbase shell i got the following error
NoMethodError: undefined method `close' for nil:NilClass
initialize at C:/_servers/db/hbase/V090~1.2//bin/../lib/ruby/irb/hirb.rb:39
start at C:_servers\db\hbase\V090~1.2\/bin/hirb.rb:171
(root) at C:_servers\db\hbase\V090~1.2\/bin/hirb.rb:183
After a while of investigation it seems that the error comes from the fact that "/dev/null" is not functioning as expected. When changing to "NUL" (in lib/ruby/irb/hirb.rb line 34), which is window equivalent, the shell worked ok.
The fix
change: f = File.open("/dev/null", "w") to f = File.open("NUL", "w")
