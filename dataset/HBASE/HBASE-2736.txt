Summary:
Disable table does not work anymore
Description:
When trying to disable a table, the shell exhausts the retries, then throws the following:
ERROR: org.apache.hadoop.hbase.RegionException: Retries exhausted, it took too long to wait for the table t1 to be disabled.
in HBaseAdmin.java:disableTable, after disabling, the code checks again, using isTableDisabled, which always returns false.
Also, after running a disable, in Zookeeper, in "/hbase/UNASSIGNED", I get an entry, which is exactly the name of the only region of the table I am trying to disable. This leads me to believe this bug is somehow linked to HBASE-2694.
This reproduces on my machine, our cluster, with freshly installed HBase, with new data, as well as with old one.
