Summary:
HBase script assumes pre-Hadoop 0.21 layout of jar files
Description:
The following in the bin/hbase:
HADOOPCPPATH=$(append_path "${HADOOPCPPATH}" `ls ${HADOOP_HOME}/hadoop-core*.jar`)
assumes a pre-21 Hadoop layout. It'll be better to dynamically account for
either hadoop-core* or hadoop-common*, hadoop-hdfs*, hadoop-mapreduce*
