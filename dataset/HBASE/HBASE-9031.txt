Summary:
ImmutableBytesWritable.toString() should downcast the bytes before converting to hex string
Description:
The attached patch addresses few issues.
We need only (3*this.length) capacity in ByteBuffer and not (3*this.bytes.length).
Do not calculate (offset + length) at every iteration.
No test is required at every iteration to add space (' ') before every byte other than the first one. Uses sb.substring(1) instead.
Finally and most importantly (the original issue of this report), downcast the promoted int (the parameter to Integer.toHexString()) to byte range.
Without #4, the byte array {54,125,64, -1, -45} is transformed to "36 7d 40 ffffffff ffffffd3" instead of "36 7d 40 ff d3".
