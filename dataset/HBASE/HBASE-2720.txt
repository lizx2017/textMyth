Summary:
TestFromClientSide fails for client region cache prewarm on Hudson
Description:
TestFromClientSide failed by HBASE-2468 patch: http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/HBase-TRUNK/1322/testReport/junit/org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client/TestFromClientSide/testRegionCachePreWarm/
It seems the number of actual cached regions was less than expected (as configured) on hudson.
