Summary:
Do not retry exceptions such as unknown scanner or illegal argument
Description:
We moved a bunch of the client code inside Callables. Exceptions out of Callable.call are caught and the method reinvoked up to the retry limit. This behavior is done even if the exception shouldn't be retried: e.g. UnknownScannerException. In the latter case, it doesn't matter how many times you retry, its never going to come right.
