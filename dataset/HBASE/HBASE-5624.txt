Summary:
Aborting regionserver when splitting region, may cause daughter region not assigned by ServerShutdownHandler.
Description:
If one region is splitting when regionserver is stoping.
The following code may executed in SplitTransaction#openDaughters.
// TODO: Is this check needed here?
    if (stopped || stopping) {
      // add 2nd daughter first (see HBASE-4335)
      MetaEditor.addDaughter(server.getCatalogTracker(),
          b.getRegionInfo(), null);
      MetaEditor.addDaughter(server.getCatalogTracker(),
          a.getRegionInfo(), null);
      LOG.info("Not opening daughters " +
          b.getRegionInfo().getRegionNameAsString() +
          " and " +
          a.getRegionInfo().getRegionNameAsString() +
          " because stopping=" + stopping + ", stopped=" + stopped);
    } 
So, for the two daughter regions, their location are both null in .META.
When ServerShutdownHandler process the dead server, it will not assign these two daughter regions since their location(info:server) are null in .META. by MetaReader.getServerUserRegions().
