Summary:
midKey found compacting is the first, not necessarily the optimal
Description:
It does this in HRegion:
      for (HStore store: stores.values()) {
        final byte [] key = store.compact(force);                                                                                  
        if (key != null && midKey == null) {                                                                                       
          midKey = key;                                                                                                            
        }
      }
If many families, then we can return a suboptimal midKey.
Marking minor but including in 0.2 because (I think) the fix is trivial.
