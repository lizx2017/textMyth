Summary:
Disabling of Catalog tables should not be allowed
Description:
HBaseAdmin#disableTable() when called with META or ROOT table, it will pass the disable instruction to Master and table is actually getting disabled. Later this API call will fail as there is a call to HBaseAdmin#isTableDisabled() which is having a check like isLegalTableName(tableName).So this call makes the catalog table to be in disabled state.
We can have same kind of isLegalTableName(tableName) checks in disableTable() and enableTable() APIs
