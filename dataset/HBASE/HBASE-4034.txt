Summary:
HRegionServer should be stopped even if no META regions are hosted by the HRegionServer
Description:
HRegionServer always makes sure one META region is hosted for it to stop. This should be changed so that even if no META regions are hosted, the HRegionServer should be stopped once all user regions are closed.
