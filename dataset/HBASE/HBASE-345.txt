Summary:
[hbase] Change configuration on running cluster
Description:
Most options currently require restart for them to be noticed or taking table offline. It should be possible to change certain configuration attributes even though the cluster is online and under load; examples would include setting flush and compaction size/frequency/limits or more radically, changing region size.
