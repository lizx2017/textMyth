Summary:
Shell should allow deletions in .META. and -ROOT- tables
Description:
For administrative and debugging purposes, it would be nice to be able to delete rows from .META. via the shell. The alternative is writing custom java code to do such operations, which is just ridiculous. The reality of HBase's maturity is that from time to time we're going to have to reach into the .META. and ROOT tables to fix things, so I think the shell should be where that happens.
Currently, attempting to delete from either table gives a "non-existant table" error.
