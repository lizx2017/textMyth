Summary:
HBaseConfiguration implements hashCode() without implementing equals()
Description:
I was browsing though the HBase 0.20.1 code in order to learn about the way HBase deals with Configuration and I noticed that HBaseConfiguration overrides hashCode() without implementing equals(). This can cause some tricky, hard to debug problems whenever instances of this class are added to Maps or HashSets.
