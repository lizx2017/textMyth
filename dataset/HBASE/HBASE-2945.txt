Summary:
stop using string for block name in LRU block cache/hfile
Description:
all my profiling runs indicate there is a large number of string/char[] objects and string manipulation is taking a long time in profiling runs. These come from the LRU block cache, block id. Also we should support the eviction of blocks belonging to particular hfiles, and the current code doesn't help with that right now.
Let's do something better. Whatever that might be.
