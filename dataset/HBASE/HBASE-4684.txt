Summary:
REST server is leaking ZK connections in 0.90
Description:
As reported a month ago, http://search-hadoop.com/m/FD6gmKzrxY1, the REST server is leak ZK connections. Upon investigation I see that TableResource.scanTransformAttrs creates a new HBA per minute per table (when the server is getting requests) but never deletes the connection created in there.
There are a bunch of other places where HBAs are created but not cleaned after like SchemaResource, StorageClusterStatusResource, StorageClusterVersionResource, ExistsResource, etc. Those places shouldn't be as leaky under normal circumstances tho.
Thanks to Jack Levin for bringing up this issue again when he tried to upgrade.
