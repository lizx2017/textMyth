Summary:
Update ExportSnapshot to reflect changes in HBASE-7419
Description:
HBASE-7419 changed the link naming and the HFileLink/Reference check.
ExportSnapshot was not updated after that, so with a Link Reference HFileLink.isLink() now returns false and causes an error during a exportSnapshot with reference files
