Summary:
Improve detection of secure ZooKeeper
Description:
HBase client code assumes ZooKeeper is secured, as long as there is a java.security.auth.login.config property being set. When HBase client is embedded in other java program with other security configuration, it can produce wrong assumption that ZooKeeper is secured. Ideally, isSecureZooKeeper method should detect Jaas configuration specifically for ZooKeeper to ensure that client program doesn't have a false positive detection.
