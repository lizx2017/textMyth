Summary:
Option to Exclude Bulk Import Files from Minor Compaction
Description:
We ran an incremental scrape with HFileOutputFormat and encountered major compaction storms. This is caused by the bug in HBASE-3404. The permanent fix is a little tricky without HBASE-2856. We realized that a quicker solution for avoiding these compaction storms is to simply exclude bulk import files from minor compactions and let them only be handled by time-based major compactions. Add with functionality along with a config option to enable it.
