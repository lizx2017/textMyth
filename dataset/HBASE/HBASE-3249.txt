Summary:
Typing 'help shutdown' in the shell shouldn't shutdown the cluster
Description:
hp on IRC found out the bad way that typing 'help shutdown' actually gives you the full help... and shuts down the cluster. I don't really understand why we process both commands, putting against 0.90.0 if anyone has an idea.
