Summary:
.META. regionserver died, cluster recovered but not UI
Description:
Getting 500 in UI:
org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.RetriesExhaustedException: Trying to contact region server null for region , row '', but failed after 3 attempts.
Exceptions:
java.net.ConnectException: Call to /208.76.44.141:60020 failed on connection exception: java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused
...
Doesn't recover.
I think issue is here in HCM:
        } catch (IOException e) {
          if (e instanceof RemoteException) {
            e = RemoteExceptionHandler.decodeRemoteException(
                (RemoteException) e);
          }
          if (tries < numRetries - 1) {
            if (LOG.isDebugEnabled()) {
              LOG.debug("locateRegionInMeta attempt " + tries + " of " +
                this.numRetries + " failed; retrying after sleep of " +
                getPauseTime(tries), e);
            }
            relocateRegion(parentTable, metaKey);
          } else {
...
The call to relocateRegion is going to result in an attempt at finding the .META.,,1 region in .META. which will get a ConnectionException again.
On ConnectionException, should be backing up and going to ROOT to find new location of .META.
