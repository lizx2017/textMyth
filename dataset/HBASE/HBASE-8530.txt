Summary:
Refine error message from ExportSnapshot when there is leftover snapshot in target cluster
Description:
ExportSnapshot performs the following validation check before starting export:
    // Check if the snapshot already in-progress
    if (outputFs.exists(snapshotTmpDir)) {
      System.err.println("A snapshot with the same name '" + snapshotName + "' is in-progress");
      return 1;
    }
The intention was to prevent concurrent snapshot export when snapshot with the same name may be outstanding.
Here is sample output:
hbase@ip-10-165-36-226 root$ hbase org.apache.hadoop.hbase.snapshot.ExportSnapshot -snapshot snapone -copy-to hdfs://10.12.113.22:8020/apps/hbase/data -mappers 1
A snapshot with the same name 'snapone' is in-progress
We should note the actual path in the error message so that user can check whether the snapshot with same name is still pending.
