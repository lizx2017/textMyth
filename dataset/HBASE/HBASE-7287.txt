Summary:
HBase inconsistencies when merge failing on "Files have same sequenceid"
Description:
When regions merge is failing because the files have the same sequenceID, the expected region is still created even if it's not used, which leaves the system with inconsistencies. The new region creation should be moved after the sequenceID test to avoid this issue, until we find a way to merge regions with the same sequenceID.
