Summary:
TestReplication failing up on builds.a.o because already running zk with new format root servername
Description:
When the test runs, I see this at the start of the output:
2011-09-21 04:56:35,282 INFO  [main] zookeeper.MiniZooKeeperCluster(122): Failed binding ZK Server to client port: 21818
2011-09-21 04:56:35,344 INFO  [main] zookeeper.MiniZooKeeperCluster(136): Started MiniZK Server on client port: 21819
So, I think what is going on is that the test is connecting to the wrong zk ensemble because it does this on setup:
  @BeforeClass
  public static void setUpBeforeClass() throws Exception {
    conf1 = HBaseConfiguration.create();
    conf1.set(HConstants.ZOOKEEPER_ZNODE_PARENT, "/1");
    // smaller block size and capacity to trigger more operations
    // and test them
    conf1.setInt("hbase.regionserver.hlog.blocksize", 1024*20);
    conf1.setInt("replication.source.size.capacity", 1024);
    conf1.setLong("replication.source.sleepforretries", 100);
    conf1.setInt("hbase.regionserver.maxlogs", 10);
    conf1.setLong("hbase.master.logcleaner.ttl", 10);
    conf1.setBoolean(HConstants.REPLICATION_ENABLE_KEY, true);
    conf1.setBoolean("dfs.support.append", true);
    conf1.setLong(HConstants.THREAD_WAKE_FREQUENCY, 100);

    utility1 = new HBaseTestingUtility(conf1);
    utility1.startMiniZKCluster();
....
and we refer to conf1 subsequently rather than to HTU.getConfiguration.
