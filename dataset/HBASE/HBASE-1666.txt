Summary:
'safe mode' is broken; MetaScanner initial scan completes without scanning .META.
Description:
initial scan completed flag is set on scanner though it hasn't been deployed never mind scanned. This means we pass out of safe mode soon after startup.
Even if metascanner is fixed so initialScan does not complete till after .META. has been scanned the first time, 'safe mode' seems to mess with region assignment in a way that makes it crawl.
Investigate and fix.
