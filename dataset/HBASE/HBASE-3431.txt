Summary:
Regionserver is not using the name given it by the master; double entry in master listing of servers
Description:
Our man Ted Dunning found the following where RS checks in with one name, the master tells it use another name but we seem to go ahead and continue with our original name.
In RS logs I see:
2011-01-07 15:45:50,757 INFO  org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.HRegionServer [regionserver60020]: Master passed us address to use. Was=perfnode11:60020, Now=10.10.30.11:60020
On master I see
2011-01-07 15:45:38,613 INFO  org.apache.hadoop.hbase.master.ServerManager [IPC Server handler 0 on 60000]: Registering server=10.10.30.11,60020,1294443935414, regionCount=0, userLoad=false
....
then later
2011-01-07 15:45:44,247 INFO  org.apache.hadoop.hbase.master.ServerManager [IPC Server handler 2 on 60000]: Registering server=perfnode11,60020,1294443935414, regionCount=0, userLoad=true
This might be since we started letting servers register in other than with the reportStartup.
