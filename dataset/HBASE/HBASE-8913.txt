Summary:
Remove ".replogs" reference as we no longer use it
Description:
Code has a single reference remaining of .replogs, that we can now remove as we do not use that dir nor create it anymore.
Previous desc:
The /hbase/ dir can also have .replogs under it, which isn't accounted for during Master's check for user-table dirs, and we end up receiving warnings for missing .tableinfo files under it.
