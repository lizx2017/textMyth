Summary:
Don't ignore corrupt StoreFiles when opening a region
Description:
We used to ignore StoreFiles that failed to open, which led to a situation when only a subset of regions was opened, and HBase did not return results to clients for the affected set of keys. This change makes sure we propagate IOExceptions coming from an attempt to open a StoreFile all the way up to HRegionServer.openRegion, where it will lead to a failure to open the whole region. This way we can avoid returning corrupt data to the application.
