Summary:
requestCompaction priority argument is not used (except for user compaction check)
Description:
In some places, like major compaction chore or requesting interface for coproc, we pass priority value to requestCompaction.
Checking the code in trunk and old code in 94, I see that neither uses this value properly; first, they check it for being user-level. Then they do this:
        // everything went better than expected. create a compaction request
        int pri = getCompactPriority(priority);
        ret = new CompactionRequest(region, this, filesToCompact, isMajor, pri);
getPriority does:
    // If this is a user-requested compaction, leave this at the highest priority
    if(priority == PRIORITY_USER) {
      return PRIORITY_USER;
    } else {
      return this.blockingStoreFileCount - this.storefiles.size();
    }
, so non-user caller value is just thrown away. Probably if it's not NO_PRIORITY, it needs to be used. Overall priority code needs cleanup.
