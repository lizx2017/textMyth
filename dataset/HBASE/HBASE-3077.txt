Summary:
HBase runs off the road if you enable/disable/enable/disable the table and then delete
Description:
HBASE-3063 has a bit of detail. The new master is better around disable, delete but still not good enough. This issue is about digging in a bit. While disable and enable are not just flags up in zk, setting either is followed by the actual open/close of regions. We need to add support to the master where it can follow swift enabling/disabling. HBASE-3063 add some lag to the delete so we'll wait on region close before we go ahead and remove the region but we should be able to do better here too... e.g. make use of Nicolas's new interrupt compactions so delete doesn't ahve to wait on ongoing compactions... and we could add an abort of specific regions only so we could just crash them closed rather than wait on flushes if they are going to be just deleted anyways.
