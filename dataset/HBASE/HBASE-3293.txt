Summary:
Negative timestamps can be inserted without fail but not read again
Description:
When inserting a value into HBase that has a negative timestamp, such as -1, HBase inserts that value without an exception or any kind of other warning if we use the Java API. The value is written to a region and the webinterface of the regionservers shows that there is data in them.
However: neither a Scan nor a Get nor any other operation via MapReduce in the Shell or via Java can read that specific value out.
There would be 2 different fixes in my opinion:
1. simply accept the negative timestamps consequently in read and write operations
2. if negative timestamps cannot be used, throw an exception when someone tries to insert an invalid timestamp
