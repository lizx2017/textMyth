Summary:
Complain if clock skew across the cluster is badly out of sync
Description:
hbase-710 and hbase-609 are issues where the system has broken in presence of clock skew over the cluster. Would be a nice service if master could flag very bad clock skew. Regionservers could report their local time when they ping the master. It could do a compare.
