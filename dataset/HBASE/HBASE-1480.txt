Summary:
compaction file not cleaned up after a crash/OOME server
Description:
We do not clean up compaction files after a crash/OOME of a region server.
I am not sure how the compaction file naming is anymore if its not reproducable some how we
should let the master or the server with the root region check every so often and delete old files say
older then 24 hours in the compaction dir's of the tables
