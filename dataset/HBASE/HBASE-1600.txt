Summary:
Multiple HBase clients to multiple indpendent HBase clusters from the same jvm should be allowed
Description:
ZK quorum servers list is static in ZooKeeperWrapper and is coupled to zoo.cfg.
This prevents multiple clients from connecting to multiple distinct HBase clusters and requires zoo.cfg to exist on a cluster that needs to connect to a remote HBase cluster.
