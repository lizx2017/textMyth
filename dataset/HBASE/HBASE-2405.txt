Summary:
Close, split, open of regions in RegionServer are run by a single thread only.
Description:
JGray and Karthik observed yesterday that a regoin open message arrived at the regionserver but that the regionserver worker thread did not get around to the actually opening until 45 seconds later (region offline for 45 seconds). We only run a single Worker thread in a regoinserver processing open, close, and splits. In this case, a long running close (or two) held up the worker thread. We need to run more than a single worker. A pool of workers? Should opens be prioritized?
