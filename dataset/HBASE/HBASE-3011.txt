Summary:
HMaster cannot exit gracefully when NameNode is unavailable
Description:
When NameNode is not available and HMaster detects it, it tries to shut down itself. However,the main thread stuck at waiting for other scanner threads to exit, which does not happen.
The main problem is that the shutdown request flag is not set to be true so other threads do not know that they need to exit.
