Summary:
DeleteColumns deletes alphabetical next columns when using timestamp 0
Description:
When calling Delete.deleteColumns to delete (all versions of) a column, the columns with a qualifier that is alphabetical higher than the deleted column are deleted as well when the cells have timestamp 0.
When the cells have a timestamp higher than 0 this is not the case.
The test case DeleteColumnsTest (tested against HBase 0.89.0-r1004203-3076) contains a scenario showing this behaviour :
put values in 3 columns (A, B and C) of the same column family at timestamp 0.
delete all versions of column B (using Delete.deleteColumns() )
read columns A and C
result : for column A a result is given, for column C not (the alphabetical order is in play here!)
