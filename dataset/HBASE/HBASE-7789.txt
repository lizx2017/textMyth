Summary:
Clean DeadServer.java and add a Jitter method in ConnectionUtils
Description:
I need to do some changes in DeadServer because of HBASE-7590. To minimize the patch size and simplifies the feedback, I prefer to isolate the issue.
Changes are:
Add the time when the server was declared as dead. It's what I need in HBASE-7590, but it makes sense even without it, for example to be shown in the UI.
suppress the extends on Set & clean up all the not used methods
use directly the object instead of a copy.
For connection utils, we currently have a jitter of 1%. I need a bigger one for sure in one case, but I wonder if we should not increase it in all cases? instead of plus 1%, we should have plus or minus 10% imho.
Tests are in progress locally, I will add the patch when they're ok.
