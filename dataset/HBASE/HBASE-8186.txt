Summary:
Untether javadoc and site build
Description:
Currently javadoc is built when site is invoked. It is tied to the pre-site scope. The javadoc goal is aggregate. Aggregate goals should be run from the command line generally, not tied to scopes else they tend to trigger package invocations in sub-modules (http://www.sonatype.com/books/mvnref-book/reference/assemblies-sect-basics.html).
This issue manifests as mvn build failing because we can't find hbase-*.jar dependencies even though we don't think we want them since we're just doing a site build (We've seen this on jenkins build where Nick added the site check; up there the workaround was adding a -N – do not recurse – flag).
Let me remove building javadoc from site lifecycle. Invoke it explicitly on the command line if you need it. Will update the refguide and remove the -N from the dev-tools as part of this patch.
