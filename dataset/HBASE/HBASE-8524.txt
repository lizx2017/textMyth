Summary:
HBaseClient gets stuck waiting for a response
Description:
We've seen in a couple of replication use cases that the client thread keeps waiting for a response but waits for ever, as it does not get a response.
The client waits indefintely even if a rpcTimeout is specified.
1) Need to find out what is causing this.
2) Convert the unconditional wait() in HBaseClient into a timed wait, so that the client can bail out if it waits longer than the rpcTimeout
