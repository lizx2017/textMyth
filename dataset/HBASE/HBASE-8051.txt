Summary:
0.95 build failing on site goal: 'failed to get report for org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-project-info-reports-plugin: Could not find goal 'dependency-info''
Description:
I cannot reproduce locally using same mvn. Let me try upgrading our report plugin. Apparently 'dependency-info' is a new target since 2.5 and our version is 2.4 going by http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-project-info-reports-plugin/ (I can't find an explicity invocation of 'dependency-info')
