Summary:
Scanner: every cell in a row has the same timestamp
Description:
A row can have multiple cells, and each cell can have a different timestamp. The get command in the shell demonstrates that cells are being stored with different timestamps:
hbase(main):008:0> get 'table1', 'row2'  
COLUMN                       CELL 
 fam1:letters                timestamp=1215707612949, value=def 
 fam1:numbers                timestamp=1215707629064, value=123 
 fam2:letters                timestamp=1215711498969, value=abc 
3 row(s) in 0.0100 seconds
However, using the scanners to retrieve these cells shows that they all have the same timestamp:
hbase(main):009:0> scan 'table1'  
ROW                          COLUMN+CELL
 row2                        column=fam1:letters, timestamp=1215711498969, value=def 
 row2                        column=fam1:numbers, timestamp=1215711498969, value=123 
 row2                        column=fam2:letters, timestamp=1215711498969, value=abc 
3 row(s) in 0.0600 seconds
The scanners are losing timestamp information somewhere along the line.
