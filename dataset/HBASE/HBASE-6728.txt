Summary:
[89-fb] prevent OOM possibility due to per connection responseQueue being unbounded
Description:
The per connection responseQueue is an unbounded queue. The request handler threads today try to send the response in line, but if things start to backup, the response is sent via a per connection responder thread. This intermediate queue, because it has no bounds, can be another source of OOMs.
[Have not looked at this issue in trunk. So it may or may not be applicable there.]
