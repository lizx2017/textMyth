Summary:
Add to MapFile a getClosest that returns key that comes just-before if key not present (Currently does just-after only).
Description:
The list of regions that make up a table in hbase are effectively kept in a mapfile. Regions are identified by the first row contained by that region. To find the region that contains a particular row, we need to be able to search the mapfile of regions to find the closest matching row that falls just-before the searched-for key rather than the just-after that is current mapfile getClosest behavior.
