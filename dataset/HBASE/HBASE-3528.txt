Summary:
Maven should restrict more exported deps
Description:
Our maven build exports a lot of deps, and they flow to clients who depend on us.
for example we shouldnt export thrift,protobuf,jetty,jruby,tomcat,jersey,guava, etc.
Clients should be able to depend on any version of the above libraries or NOT depend on them.
