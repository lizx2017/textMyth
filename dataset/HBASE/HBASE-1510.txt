Summary:
allow zookeeper quorum IPs in DNS as an option
Description:
instead of configuring IPs in zoo.conf, allow retrieving the IPs from DNS. This way we don't have to supply zoo.conf or any hbase-site.xml to clients.
eg, one quorum might ahve a dns name of 'quorum1', the hbase path, you could specify the cluster in code like:
HTable table = new HTable("/quorum1/hbase/table_name");
and avoid having to distribute hbase-site.xml or zoo.cfg.
