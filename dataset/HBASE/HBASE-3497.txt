Summary:
TableMapReduceUtil.initTableReducerJob broken due to setConf method in TableOutputFormat
Description:
setConf() method in TableOutputFormat gets called and it replaces the hbase.zookeeper.quorum address in the job conf xml when you run a CopyTable job from one cluster to another. The conf gets set to the peer.addr that is specified, which makes the job read and write from/to the peer cluster instead of reading from the original cluster and writing to the peer.
Possibly caused due to the change in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-3111
