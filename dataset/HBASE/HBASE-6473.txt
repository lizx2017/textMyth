Summary:
deleted table is not deleted completely, some region may be still online
Description:
consider such Scenario:
we have a table called T1, which has 1 regions: A
1. move A from rs1 to rs2,and A is now closed
2. disable T1,
3. delete T1.
when we disable T1, disable handler will just set the zk to disabled and A will still be assigned. when Ais opened, A in transition will be clean out.
At that time, Deletetable found it is safe to delete all regions and table in meta and fs , it will also delete the zk node of T1.
while (System.currentTimeMillis() < done) {
        AssignmentManager.RegionState rs = am.isRegionInTransition(region);
        if (rs == null) break;
        Threads.sleep(waitingTimeForEvents);
        LOG.debug("Waiting on  region to clear regions in transition; " + rs);
      }
      if (am.isRegionInTransition(region) != null) {
        throw new IOException("Waited hbase.master.wait.on.region (" +
          waitTime + "ms) for region to leave region " +
          region.getRegionNameAsString() + " in transitions");
      }
however A is still being unassigned, when it finished closed the A,it finds that the disabled state in zk is deleted, and then A will be assigned again.
