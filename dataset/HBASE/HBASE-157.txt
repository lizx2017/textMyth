Summary:
[hbase] region 'requests' attribute is unreliable
Description:
Watching the hbase webUI, the request counter in the load column reported in the list of regionservers doesn't make sense. Refreshing, the request count will tend to rise for a while as you'd expect but then they'll start to fall and will often drop to zero. This is on regionservers with constant count of regions (I'd expect load to be zero on a new region after a split).
