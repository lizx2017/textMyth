Summary:
Regex filters are at least an order of magnitude slower since 0.94.3
Description:
I found this issue after debugging a performance problem on an OpenTSDB cluster, it was basically unusable after an upgrade from 0.94.2 to 0.94.6. It was caused by HBASE-7279 (ping Lars Hofhansl).
The easiest way to see it is to run a simple 1 client PE:
$ ./bin/hbase org.apache.hadoop.hbase.PerformanceEvaluation sequentialWrite 1
Then in the shell do a filter scan (flush the table first and make sure if fits in your blockcache if you want stable numbers).
Pre HBASE-7279:
hbase(main):028:0> scan 'TestTable', {FILTER => "(RowFilter (=, 'regexstring:0000055872') )"}
ROW                                                 COLUMN+CELL                                                                                                                                         
 0000055872                                         column=info:data, timestamp=1378248850191, value=(blanked)

Post HBASE-7279
hbase(main):037:0* scan 'TestTable', {FILTER => "(RowFilter (=, 'regexstring:0000055872') )"}
ROW                                                 COLUMN+CELL                                                                                                                                         
 0000055872                                         column=info:data, timestamp=1378248850191, value=(blanked)

I tried a bunch of 0.94, up to 0.94.11, and the tip of 0.96. They are all slow like this.
It seems that since that jira went in we do a lot more row matching, and running the regex gets super expensive.
