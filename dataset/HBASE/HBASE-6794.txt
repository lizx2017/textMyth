FilterBase should provide a default implementation of toByteArray
Description:
See HBASE-6657, FilterBase provides stub implementations for other Filter methods, it seems reasonable for it to provide a default implementation for toByteArray, for Filters that don't need special serialization (e.g. ones with no state).
