Summary:
During recovery use ZK as the source of truth for region state
Description:
In HLogSplitter:locateRegionAndRefreshLastFlushedSequenceId(HConnection, byte[], byte[], String), we talk to the replayee regionserver to figure out whether a region is in recovery or not. We should look at ZK only for this piece of information (since that is the source of truth for recovery otherwise).
