Summary:
hbase script should add $HADOOP_HOME/lib/native/$JAVA_PLATFORM to JAVA_LIBRARY_PATH
Description:
Currently hbase sets JAVA_LIBRARY_PATH to Hbase native/lib/$JAVA_PLATFORM plus anything added to HBASE_LIBRARY_PATH.
If HADOOP_HOME is defined and $HADOOP_HOME/lib/native/$JAVA_PLATFORM directory exits, then $HADOOP_HOME/lib/native/$JAVA_PLATFORM should be added to the JAVA_LIBRARY_PATH.
However this brings up a more general issue, if HADOOP_HOME is defined, hbase should use the JARs, SOs and configuration from it, right?
From what I understand something like this was done in the past.
