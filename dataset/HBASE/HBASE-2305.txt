Summary:
Client port for ZK has no default
Description:
From Doug Meil on the list:
config.set("hbase.zookeeper.property.clientPort","2181");

This is consistent with other references to the importance of "hbase.zookeeper.quorum" except that we did this testing with the intent of connecting using only parameters set in code to eliminate any classpath issues with XML files.

FYI... If the last parameter isn't set you'll get the following error....       could this be defaulted to a reasonable value?

It should be easy to set it to 2181 along with the other port settings in HQuorumPeer.
