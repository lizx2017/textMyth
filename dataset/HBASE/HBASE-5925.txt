Summary:
Issue with only using the old config param hbase.hstore.compactionThreshold but not the corresponding new one
Description:
One observation while going through the code:-
In MemStoreFlusher constructor
this.blockingStoreFilesNumber =
      conf.getInt("hbase.hstore.blockingStoreFiles", 7);
    if (this.blockingStoreFilesNumber == -1) {
      this.blockingStoreFilesNumber = 1 +
        conf.getInt("hbase.hstore.compactionThreshold", 3);
    }
Here as per the code if hbase.hstore.blockingStoreFiles is configured as -1, we are making this value to be 1+ min files to compact
But here we read the old config item only!
Here also we need to read the new config 1st and if not there then the old one.. Is this a miss?
Like
conf.getInt("hbase.hstore.compaction.min",
conf.getInt("hbase.hstore.compactionThreshold", 3))
