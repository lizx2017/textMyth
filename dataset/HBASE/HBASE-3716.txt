Summary:
Intermittent TestRegionRebalancing failure
Description:
See HBase-TRUNK build #1820
This could be due to HBASE-3681
In trunk, default value of "hbase.regions.slop" is 20%. It is possible for load balancer to see region distribution which falls within 20% of optimal distribution.
However, assertRegionsAreBalanced() uses 10% slop.
One solution is to align the slop in assertRegionsAreBalanced() with "hbase.regions.slop" value.
