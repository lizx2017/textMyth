Summary:
Fix FSUtils.createTableDescriptor()
Description:
Currently createTableDescriptor() doesn't return anything.
The caller wouldn't know whether the descriptor is created or not. See exception handling:
   } catch(IOException ioe) {
     LOG.info("IOException while trying to create tableInfo in HDFS", ioe);
   }
We should return a boolean.
If the table descriptor exists already, maybe we should deserialize from hdfs and compare with htableDescriptor argument. If they differ, I am not sure what the proper action would be.
Maybe we can add a boolean argument, force, to createTableDescriptor(). When force is true, existing table descriptor would be overwritten.
