Summary:
Address HBASE-8764 'Some MasterMonitorCallable should retry' review
Description:
Jesse came in w/ some review post-commit. Let me address in this followup. Let me paste form our offlist correspondence:
+++ b/hbase-client/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/client/RegionOfflineException.java

Really? Same patch? Come on man - you are doing similar cleanup all over the place (shakes head)...
+@InterfaceStability.Stable
+public class RpcRetryingCaller<T> {
Calling this stable as the first time its going in seems a bit presumptuous...
+ this.startTime = EnvironmentEdgeManager.currentTimeMillis();
+ int remaining = (int)(callTimeout - (this.startTime - this.globalStartTime));
+ if (remaining < MIN_RPC_TIMEOUT)
Unknown macro: {+ // If there is no time left, we're trying anyway. It's too late.+ // 0 means no timeout, and it's not the intent here. So we secure both cases by+ // resetting to the minimum.+ remaining = MIN_RPC_TIMEOUT;+ }
+ RpcClient.setRpcTimeout(remaining);
Looks like some new logic... seems reasonable to me, so I'll let it slide this time
