Summary:
If you shutdown all RS an active master is never able to recover when RS come back online
Description:
I've been doing some isolated benchmarking of a single RS and can repeatedly trigger some craziness in the master if I shutdown the RS. It is never able to recover after bringing RSs back online. I seem to see different behavior across different branches / revisions of the 92 branch, but there does seem to be an issue in several of them.
Putting against 0.92.1 so we don't hold up the release of 0.92. Should not be a blocker.
Working on a unit test now.
