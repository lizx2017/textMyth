Summary:
ZooKeeper ensureParentExists calls fail on absolute path
Description:
If user specifies absolute path for one of the files in ZooKeeper, the following will not do what it's supposed to:
if (!ensureZNodeExists(parentZNode)) {
...
Because the user specified path is not a child of parentZNode, all operations on it will fail.
