Summary:
it seems that CLASSPATH elements coming from Hadoop change HBase behaviour
Description:
It looks like HBASE-3465 introduced a slight change in behavior. The ordering of classpath elements makes Hadoop ones go before the HBase ones, which leads to log4j properties picked up from the wrong place, etc. It seems that the easies way to fix that would be to revert the ordering of classpath.
