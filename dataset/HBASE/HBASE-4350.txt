Summary:
Fix a Bloom filter bug introduced by HFile v2 and TestMultiColumnScanner that caught it
Description:
Nicolas pointed out to me that the new unit test TestMultiColumnScanner that I wrote for the multi-column scanner Bloom filter optimization (which we will soon release) did not pass on the open-source trunk, and it bisected down to the HFile v2 commit. I debugged the unit test and found that there was a serious bug in HFile v2 Bloom filter lookup not caught by any of the existing unit tests: Bloom filters were used for "non-Get" Scans, which did not have minimum/maximum row set correctly, and some scan results were not returned.
This diff is the unit test that helped catch the problem and a one-line fix for the bug.
