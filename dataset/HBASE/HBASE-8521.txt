Summary:
Cells cannot be overwritten with bulk loaded HFiles
Description:
Let's say you have a pre-built HFile that contains a cell:
('rowkey1', 'family1', 'qual1', 1234L, 'value1')
We bulk load this first HFile. Now, let's create a second HFile that contains a cell that overwrites the first:
('rowkey1', 'family1', 'qual1', 1234L, 'value2')
That gets bulk loaded into the table, but the value that HBase bubbles up is still 'value1'.
It seems that there's no way to overwrite a cell for a particular timestamp without an explicit put operation. This seems to be the case even after minor and major compactions happen.
My guess is that this is pretty closely related to the sequence number work being done on the compaction algorithm via HBASE-7842, but I'm not sure if one of would fix the other.
