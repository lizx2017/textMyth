Summary:
Add more checks in replication if RS is stopped
Description:
In a few places in the replication code I abort the region server if I get ZK exceptions, which often happens when closing down a region server cleanly (wasn't the case before). It results in a bunch of exceptions being thrown for nothing, adding more checks should resolve this easily.
