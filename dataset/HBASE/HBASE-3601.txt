Summary:
TestMasterFailover broken in TRUNK
Description:
After HBASE-3573, went in, TestMasterFailover broke. The change in shutdown technique revealed an issue with our in-memory accounting when a master joins an already cluster; we don't add .META. and ROOT to our set of online regions in the new master so could make for some interesting issues as the new master progressed (Previous shutdown did a count of remaining servers, new shutdown process looks at in-memory state to see if only catalog carrying regionservers online... this is what was going out of whack in new master).
