Summary:
the code for handling when rs.isSplit() inside AM.nodeDeleted is dead code, should be removed
Description:
I am reading the code related to region split. I feel that this code below in AssignmentManager seems to be dead code. Because 1) I don't see any place that callls to update the regionState to be State.SPLIT. 2) for scenario when region has already been split and RS crashed, ServerShutdownHandler should have already taken care of it.
Am I missing something here. If not, I would suggest to remove it.
if (rs.isSplit()) {
LOG.debug("Ephemeral node deleted, regionserver crashed?, " +
"clearing from RIT; rs=" + rs);
regionOffline(rs.getRegion());
