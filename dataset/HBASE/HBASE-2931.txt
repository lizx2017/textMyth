Summary:
Do not throw RuntimeExceptions in RPC/HbaseObjectWritable code, ensure we log and rethrow as IOE
Description:
When there are issues with RPC and HbaseObjectWritable, primarily when server and client have different jars, the only thing that happens is the client will receive an EOF exception. The server does not log what happened at all and the client does not receive a server trace, rather the server seems to close the connection and the client gets an EOF because it tries to read off of a closed stream.
We need to ensure that we catch, log, and rethrow as IOE any exceptions that may occur because of an issue with RPC or HbaseObjectWritable.
