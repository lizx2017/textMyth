Summary:
The JRuby shell documentation is wrong in "get" and "put"
Description:
In the shell documentation we can read:
hbase> get 't1', 'r1', {TIMESTAMP => ts1, VERSIONS => 4}
when in fact there are no facility for this. It will work only because it uses getRow(row, ts).
Also
hbase> put 't1', 'r1', 'c1', ts1
does not work because the 'value' is missing.
