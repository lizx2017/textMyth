Summary:
Use ports for QOS
Description:
META table isnt the only table that needs priority access, users might have tables they wish to always have high speed/real time access, but still allowing map reduces or slow/bulk operations at the same time. If we allow multiple ports open then we can create multiple QOS levels and enable this. Originally from HBASE-2782
