Summary:
HLogKey(walKey) constructor needs to be either removed, deprecated or fixed
Description:
It is currently impossible to use HLogKey(walKey) because of the NPE that occurs due to constructor itself not initializing clusterIds but instead immediately calling readFieldsFromPb which then references it:
