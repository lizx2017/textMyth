Summary:
Add total time RPC call metrics
Description:
Right now we have:
queueCallTime
exposes the ammount of time that a call is in the queue
processCallTime
exposes how long a call was processing
We don't have a stat for total time. It's pretty easy to think that the two metrics might not track together so getting a total time could be useful.
