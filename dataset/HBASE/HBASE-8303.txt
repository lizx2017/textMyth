Summary:
Increse the test timeout to 60s when they are less than 20s
Description:
Short test timeouts are dangerous because:
if the test is executed in the same jvm as another, GC, thread priority can play a role
we don't know the machine used to execute the tests, nor what's running on it;.
For this reason, a test timeout of 60s allows us to be on the safe side.
