Summary:
Javadoc and Throws Declaration for Bytes.incrementBytes() is Wrong
Description:
The throws declaration for Bytes.incrementBytes() states that an IOException is thrown by the method, and javadocs suggest that this is expected if the byte array's size is larger than SIZEOF_LONG.
The code actually uses an IllegalArgumentException, which is probably more appropriate anyways. This should be changed to simplify the code that uses this method.
