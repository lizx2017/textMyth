Summary:
[89-fb] Fix TaskMonitor/MultiPut multithreading bug
Description:
We shouldn't clear an ArrayList that might be iterated on by another thread.
Specifically, multiput() calls clear() on ArrayList (to free up some memory) while MultiPut.toMap is iterating over that ArrayList in a different thread (called from MonitorTasks UI)
