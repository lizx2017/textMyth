Summary:
Add back WALEdit#get/setScopes method
Description:
We removed WALEdit's getScopes and setScopes methods in favor of getFromScope and putIntoScope methods. However, this breaks compatibility between 0.94 versions. Fix is just to add back the get/setScopes methods to support existing clients.
