M_RS_OPEN_ROOT            (21, ExecutorType.RS_OPEN_REGION),  // Master asking RS to open root
It's a mistake only in trunk, causing ROOT couldn't be online for a long long time:
1.ROOT wait open-region-thread to handle opening it.
2.Opening regions wait for ROOT to online, but occupy the threads...
