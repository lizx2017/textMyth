Summary:
RegionCoprocesorHost.preWALRestore throws npe in case there is no RegionObserver registered.
Description:
It seems the check to bypass the Observers chain is at wrong place in case of pre/post WALRestore. It should be inside the "if statement" that checks whether the CP is instance of RegionObserver or not.
