Summary:
ServerShutdownHandler fails on NPE if a plan has a random region assignment
Description:
By chance, we were able to revert the ulimit on one of our clusters to 1024 and it started dying non-stop on "Too many open files". Now the bad thing is that some region servers weren't completely ServerShutdownHandler'd because they failed on:
2011-05-07 00:04:46,203 ERROR org.apache.hadoop.hbase.executor.EventHandler: Caught throwable while processing event M_SERVER_SHUTDOWN
java.lang.NullPointerException
at org.apache.hadoop.hbase.master.AssignmentManager.processServerShutdown(AssignmentManager.java:1804)
at org.apache.hadoop.hbase.master.handler.ServerShutdownHandler.process(ServerShutdownHandler.java:101)
at org.apache.hadoop.hbase.executor.EventHandler.run(EventHandler.java:156)

at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:908)
at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:662)
Reading the code, it seems the NPE is in the if statement:
Map.Entry<String, RegionPlan> e = i.next();
if (e.getValue().getDestination().equals(hsi)) {
  // Use iterator's remove else we'll get CME
  i.remove();
}
Which means that the destination (HSI) is null. Looking through the code, it seems we instantiate a RegionPlan with a null HSI when it's a random assignment.
It means that if there's a random assignment going on while a node dies then this issue might happen.
Initially I thought that this could mean data loss, but the logs are already split so it's just the reassignment that doesn't happen (still bad).
Also it left the master with dead server being processed, so for two days the balancer didn't run failing on:
org.apache.hadoop.hbase.master.HMaster: Not running balancer because processing dead regionserver(s): []
And the reason why the array is empty is because we are running 0.90.3 which removes the RS from the dead list if it comes back.
