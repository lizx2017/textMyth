Summary:
HLog splitLog : Properly Handle User Interrupts
Description:
Nicolas reviewed HBASE-2437 after it had been committed and raised some issues that need addressing. The main issue is that splitLog will ignore user interrupts (aka: InterruptException). Currently, data loss can occur (with 'skip.errors' == true) if a user calls 'kill <master-pid>" during splits because the code will consider the interrupted file completely split. If the master receives an interrupt during splitLog, it needs to abort splitting, delete all partially-complete split files, and exit gracefully.
