Summary:
HTable Mismatch between javadoc and what it actually does
Description:
The code is:
/**
Delete all cells that match the passed row and column and whose
timestamp is equal-to or older than the passed timestamp, using an
existing row lock.
@param row Row to update
@param column name of column whose value is to be deleted
@param ts Delete all cells of the same timestamp or older.
@param rl Existing row lock
@throws IOException
@deprecated As of hbase 0.20.0, replaced by {@link #delete(Delete)}
*/
public void deleteAll(final byte [] row, final byte [] column, final long ts,
final RowLock rl)
throws IOException
{ Delete d = new Delete(row, ts, rl); d.deleteColumn(column); delete(d); }
The code should call deleteColumns() instead.
