Summary:
[89-fb] Avoid acquiring the same row lock repeatedly
Description:
When processing the multiPut, multiMutations or multiDelete operations, each IPC handler thread tries to acquire a lock for each row key in these batches. If there are duplicated row keys in these batches, previously the IPC handler thread will repeatedly acquire the same row key again and again.
So the optimization is to sort each batch operation based on the row key in the client side, and skip acquiring the same row lock repeatedly in the server side.
