Summary:
JSON formatting for cluster status is sort of broken
Description:
In our testing on the REST side of things, we discovered that the request curl -H "Accept: application/json" http://localhost:8080/status/cluster" gets a JSON that collapses the node-list array into one node-element (can see if there are more than 1 RS in the cluster).
