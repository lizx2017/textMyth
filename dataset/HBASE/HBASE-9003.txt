Summary:
TableMapReduceUtil should not rely on org.apache.hadoop.util.JarFinder#getJar
Description:
This is the problem: TableMapReduceUtil#addDependencyJars relies on org.apache.hadoop.util.JarFinder if available to call getJar(). However getJar() uses File.createTempFile() to create a temporary file under hadoop.tmp.dir/target/test-dir. Due HADOOP-9737 the created jar and its content is not purged after the JVM is destroyed. Since most configurations point hadoop.tmp.dir under /tmp the generated jar files get purged by tmpwatch or a similar tool, but boxes that have hadoop.tmp.dir pointing to a different location not monitored by tmpwatch will pile up a collection of jars causing all kind of issues. Since JarFinder#getJar is not a public API from Hadoop (see Alejandro Abdelnur comment on HADOOP-9737) we shouldn't use that as part of TableMapReduceUtil in order to avoid this kind of issues.
