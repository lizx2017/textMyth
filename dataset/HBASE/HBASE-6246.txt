Summary:
Admin.move without specifying destination does not go through AccessController
Description:
    if (destServerName == null || destServerName.length == 0) {
      LOG.info("Passed destination servername is null/empty so " +
        "choosing a server at random");
      this.assignmentManager.clearRegionPlan(hri);
      // Unassign will reassign it elsewhere choosing random server.
      this.assignmentManager.unassign(hri);
I think we should go through security to see if there is sufficient permissions to do this operation?
