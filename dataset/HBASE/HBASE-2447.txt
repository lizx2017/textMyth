Summary:
LogSyncer.addToSyncQueue doesn't check if syncer is still running before waiting
Description:
In testing GC pause scenarios with kill -STOP, I got the regionserver into a situation where it was blocked forever while shutting down (also blocking clients, since the RPCs were still pinging). The root issue is that, if the log syncer has an error just as more edits are being done, addToSyncQueue() can go to sleep waiting on a syncer which has just died.
