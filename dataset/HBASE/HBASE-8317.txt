Summary:
Seek returns wrong result with PREFIX_TREE Encoding
Description:
TestPrefixTreeEncoding#testSeekWithFixedData from the patch could reproduce the bug.
An example of the bug case:
Suppose the following rows:
1.row3/c1:q1/
2.row3/c1:q2/
3.row3/c1:q3/
4.row4/c1:q1/
5.row4/c1:q2/
After seeking the row 'row30', the expected peek KV is row4/c1:q1/, but actual is row3/c1:q1/.
I just fix this bug case in the patch,
Maybe we can do more for other potential problems if anyone is familiar with the code of PREFIX_TREE
