Summary:
Address some recent random test failures
Description:
I've seen many unspecific test failures recently that cannot be reproduced locally even when running these test is a loop for a very long time.
Many of these test one way or the other make assumption w.r.t. wall clock time. While I cannot fix that, an option to increase some of these timeout a bit.
This issue is to remind me to do that.
