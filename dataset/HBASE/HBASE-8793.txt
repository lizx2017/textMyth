Summary:
Regionserver ubuntu's startup script return code always 0
Description:
hbase-regionserver startup script always returns 0 (exit 0 at the end of the script) this is wrong behaviour which causes issues when trying to recognise true status of the service.
Replacing it with 'exit $?' seems to fix the problem, looking at hbase master return codes are assigned to RETVAL variable which is used with exit.
Not sure if the problem exist in other versions.
> /etc/init.d/hbase-regionserver.orig status
hbase-regionserver is not running.
> echo $?
After fix:
> /etc/init.d/hbase-regionserver status
hbase-regionserver is not running.
> echo $?
