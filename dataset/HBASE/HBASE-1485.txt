Summary:
Wrong or indeterminate behavior when there are duplicate versions of a column
Description:
As of now, both gets and scanners will end up returning all duplicate versions of a column. The ordering of them is indeterminate.
We need to decide what the desired/expected behavior should be and make it happen.
Note: It's nearly impossible for this to work with Gets as they are now implemented in 1304 so this is really a Scanner issue. To implement this correctly with Gets, we would have to undo basically all the optimizations that Gets do and making them far slower than a Scanner.
