Summary:
Regionserver addresses are still not right in the new tables page
Description:
They are mostly right.
I'm guessing its stale cache of regions in the client hosted by the UI. If the webserver ran a scan, it'd probably fix it all up but thats a bit messy. I tried using the address that is in the .META. table directly but that doesn't work.... we don't seem to deploy table properly and UI complains "No server address for row TestTable,,1213074650399". I'll attach my patch.
