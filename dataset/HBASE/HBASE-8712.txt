Summary:
HFileLinkCleaner (FSUtils.listStatus) logs too much if links do not exists
Description:
Testing 0.95.1 RC1, I found that just inserting data and splitting seems to trigger a bug in the archivedHFileCleaner that makes it complain about missing files. It seems to happen mostly to reference files post-split.
I'm attaching a grep I did with the file name (you'll see the same file name happens to be in 2 regions, it's because it's a reference file).
