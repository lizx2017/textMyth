Summary:
Failure of creating split dir if it already exists prevents splits from happening further
Description:
The scenario is
-> The split of a region takes a long time
-> The deletion of the splitDir fails due to HDFS problems.
-> Subsequent splits also fail after that.
private static void createSplitDir(final FileSystem fs, final Path splitdir)
  throws IOException {
    if (fs.exists(splitdir)) throw new IOException("Splitdir already exits? " + splitdir);
    if (!fs.mkdirs(splitdir)) throw new IOException("Failed create of " + splitdir);
  }
Correct me if am wrong? If it is an issue can we change the behaviour of throwing exception?
Pls suggest.
