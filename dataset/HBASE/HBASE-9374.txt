Summary:
Client requires write access to hbase.local.dir unnecessarily
Description:
Per this thread from the dev list.
It appears that as of HBASE-1936, we now require that client applications have write access to hbase.local.dir. This is because ProtobufUtil instantiates a DyanamicClassLoader as part of static initialization. This classloader is used for instantiating Comparators, Filters, and Exceptions.
Client applications do not need to use DynamicClassLoader and so should not require this write access.
