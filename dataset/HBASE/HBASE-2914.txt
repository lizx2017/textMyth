Summary:
Profiling indicates that ThriftUtilities.rowResultFromHBase is quite inefficient
Description:
Profiling of ThriftServer here at SU has indicated that the call ThriftUtilities.rowResultFromHBase() is quite inefficient. It first calls Result.getRowResult() which is inefficient and slow. Instead by reimplementing to create the TRowResult (the thrift return type) straight from the KeyValue[] array the performance boost is substantial, reducing time serializing the results. In my profiling the time spent in scannerGetList() went from 1100ms to 108ms on similar test runs.
