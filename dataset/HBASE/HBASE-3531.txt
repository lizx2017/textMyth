Summary:
When under global memstore pressure, may try to flush unflushable regions in a tight loop
Description:
Ted ran into this in cluster testing. If the largest region is unflushable (eg it's in the midst of closing during a split, and hence doing its own flush), the global memstore pressure code doesn't notice this. So, it keeps trying to flush it, and ignores the false return code from flushRegion.
Instead, we should iterate down the list of regions and keep trying to flush them until we find one that works.
