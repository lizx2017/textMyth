Summary:
Coprocessors Are Unable To Load If RegionServer is Launched Using a Different Classloader than System Default
Description:
If a region server is launched in a context such that its classloader is different from the system class loader, then the Class object used to represent the Coprocessor interface of the coprocessor will be different than the Coprocessor Class object that is used by RegionCoprocessorHost.loadSystemCoprocessors() .
There's a few options that come to mind to fix this problem:
1. Remove the logic where loadSystemCoprocessors changes the context's ClassLoader back to the system default classloader.
2. Remove the cast to Coprocessor in CoprocessorHost.load() and invoke methods via reflection.
3. Set the class loader back to the system default before launching any daemon threads.
