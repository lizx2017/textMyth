Summary:
Add a test scope dependency on org.slf4j:slf4j-api to hbase-client
Description:
hbase-client needs a test scope dependency on org.slf4j:slf4j-api in its POM. Without this change at least Eclipse cannot resolve org.slf4j.Logger from RecoverableZooKeeper - the ZooKeeper classes use it - and so the 'hbase-client' project will not build.
