Summary:
Change logging for Coprocessor exec call to trace
Description:
Currently both RegionServer and HMaster log (debug) this
"Received dynamic protocol exec call with protocolName <class>"
on each coprocessor exec call.
We just filled our RegionServer log with 160gb of these since we're making heavy use of coprocessors.
I would like to change this to trace. Any objections?
