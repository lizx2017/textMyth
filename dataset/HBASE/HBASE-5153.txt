Summary:
Add retry logic in HConnectionImplementation#resetZooKeeperTrackers
Description:
HBASE-4893 is related to this issue. In that issue, we know, if multi-threads share a same connection, once this connection got abort in one thread, the other threads will got a "HConnectionManager$HConnectionImplementation@18fb1f7 closed" exception.
It solve the problem of "stale connection can't removed". But the orignal HTable instance cann't be continue to use. The connection in HTable should be recreated.
Actually, there's two aproach to solve this:
1. In user code, once catch an IOE, close connection and re-create HTable instance. We can use this as a workaround.
2. In HBase Client side, catch this exception, and re-create connection.
