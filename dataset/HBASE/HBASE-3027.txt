Summary:
If existing recovered.edits file when a release w/ hbase-2727 is deployed (it makes a dir named recovered.edits) then trouble
Description:
Just ran into this up on Alexey's cluster. He updated to SU github and it looks like some regions had recovered.edits files under them. The newer code was trying to read the file as a directory and failing with the plain but at same time cryptic mssage:
Caused by: org.apache.hadoop.ipc.RemoteException: java.io.FileNotFoundException: Parent path is not a directory: /hbase/mysql_word_documents/c574e848df63a14054e054545da2d3f3/recovered.edits   
It'd be a small thing to add a check if 'recovered.edits' is a file and process it as such when reading in recovered edits.
