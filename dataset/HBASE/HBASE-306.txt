Summary:
[hbase] Add an '--master=X' and '--html' command-line parameters to shell
Description:
Add to hbase shell command-line processing. At a minimum should be able to pass the master you want the shell to go against. Currently you need to edit the hbase-site.xml that is under the shell. Also, add an '--html' to output resultsets in html rather than as ascii tables (The html output is xhtml which might be sufficent for those who might want resultsets as xml â€“ lets see).
