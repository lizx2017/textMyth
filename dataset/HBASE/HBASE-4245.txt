Summary:
Cluster hangs if RS serving root fails during startup sequence
Description:
On a large-ish cluster, the following sequence of events was seen to happen:
master started, ROOT and META were both unassigned
ROOT is assigned to rs01
META is assigned to rs02
Upon open of META, it writes its location into ROOT on rs01
rs01 crashes while appending to its HLog due to some other bug
rs02 fails the region open sequence
master notices that rs01 has crashed, and enqueues a ServerShutdownHandler
ServerShutdownHandler blocks on CatalogTracker.waitForMeta() since ROOT and META are not assigned yet
master times out assignment of META, but never succeeds because ROOT location is still marked as rs01
This causes the cluster to never start up.
