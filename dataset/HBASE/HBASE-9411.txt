Summary:
Increment / decrement of rpcCount in RpcServer#Connection is not protected by synchronization
Description:
Here is related code:
    /* Decrement the outstanding RPC count */
    protected void decRpcCount() {
      rpcCount--;
    }

    /* Increment the outstanding RPC count */
    protected void incRpcCount() {
      rpcCount++;
    }
Even though rpcCount is volatile, in non atomic operations (increment / decrement) different threads may get unexpected result.
