Summary:
Bad imports in TestUser from HBASE-4515 change
Description:
The HBASE-4515 patch mistakenly added unused imports to TestUser:
import org.apache.hadoop.security.UnixUserGroupInformation;
import org.apache.hadoop.security.UserGroupInformation;
Both should be removed. UnixUserGroupInformation is specific to non-secure Hadoop and importing it will break compilation against secure Hadoop variants (0.20.205, 0.22, 0.23).
