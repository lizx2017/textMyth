Summary:
Cleanup Calls Conservatively On Timeout
Description:
In the event of a socket timeout, the HBaseClient iterates over the outstanding calls (on that socket), and notifies them that a SocketTimeoutException has occurred. Ideally, we should be cleanup up just those calls that have been outstanding for longer than the specified socket timeout.
