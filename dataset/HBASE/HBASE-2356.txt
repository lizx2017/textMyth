Summary:
HBASE-2066: may not be invalidating client cache properly when a region moves
Description:
we need a better test for this and a fix. i have seen, and have heard other people complain, about situations when regions move and the client does not seem to always relocate the region properly in a post HBASE-2066 hbase client. I have seen cases where this DOES work so there is investigation to be done.
