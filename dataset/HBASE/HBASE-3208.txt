Summary:
HLog.findMemstoresWithEditsOlderThan needs to look for edits that are equal to too
Description:
Follow up to HBASE-3198, now that we are doing the right thing it seems that TestWALObserver is throwing NPEs. Digging in more, I figured that HLog.findMemstoresWithEditsOlderThan actually needs to be looking at edits that are equal or older rather than just older since logs with only 1 edit won't get any regions to flush.
