Compactions too slow
Description:
know there was some changes to compaction a few days back I just got back
to where I could run imports with the new client api
and noticing that compactions are vary slow I meand 100x+ slower then they
used to be I thought one of the servers compaction thread had died
but after retesting and ruleing that out.
I tested with and without compression and with and with out
blockcache and all are running about the same
I got one small compaction to complete it took 1977 secs to compact 48.56MB
