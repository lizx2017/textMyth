Summary:
upgrade thrift to 0.5.0 and use mvn version
Description:
We should upgrade our thrift to 0.5.0, it is the latest and greatest and is in apache maven repo.
Doing some testing with a thrift 0.5.0 server, and an older pre-release php client shows the two are on-wire compatible.
Given that the upgrade is entirely on the server side, and has no wire-impact this should be a relatively low-impact change.
