Summary:
If a region is split during RS shutdown process, the daughter regions are NOT made online by master
Description:
When a region is splitted during the RS shutdown process, RS just written the daughter region infos to META, but not make them online. Then, for master, in its ServerShutdownHandler, the function isDaughterMissing() uses FindDaughterVisitor to check whether daughter region is OK. However, this visitor doesn't check whether the value for HConstants.SERVER_QUALIFIER carries non-null value.
Therefore for the scenario, isDaughterMissing() returns false, skipping the following line:
assignmentManager.assign(daughter, true);
