Summary:
ThriftServerRunner.HbaseHandler.mutateRow() does not use ByteBuffer correctly
Description:
We have fixed similar bug in
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-5507
It uses ByteBuffer.array() to read the ByteBuffer.
This will ignore the offset return the whole underlying byte array.
The bug can be triggered by using framed Transport thrift servers.
