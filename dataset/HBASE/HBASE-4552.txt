Summary:
multi-CF bulk load is not atomic across column families
Description:
Currently the bulk load API simply imports one HFile at a time. With multi-column-family support, this is inappropriate, since different CFs show up separately. Instead, the IPC endpoint should take a of CF -> HFiles, so we can online them all under a single region-wide lock.
