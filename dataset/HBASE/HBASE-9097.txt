Summary:
Set HBASE_CLASSPATH before rest of the classpath
Description:
We encountered this when one of the hadoop test jars (specifically hadoop-mapreduce-client-jobclient-2.0.0-cdh4.3.0-tests.jar, but that's beside the point) had an hdfs-site.xml. This clobbered the hdfs-site.xml that we included on the classpath via HBASE_CLASSPATH in hbase-env.sh, meaning the master didn't start in HA NN mode, because the proxy-provider wasn't found in the hdfs-site.xml from the test jar (even though it was in our config file) because that was the first resolution of that file.
This should be a fairly simple fix in bin/hbase, but has some potentially wide-ranging effects on existing installs that just 'happen' to work.
Generally, I'd expect things set on the HBASE_CLASSPATH to take precedence over anything else when starting the hbase daemon.
