Summary:
ZKW constructor should not always create nodes and should be more amenable to general usage
Description:
The constructor in ZooKeeperWatcher does too much. It does things like create the layout in ZK. It's probably not harmful but it's unnecessary. It should ensure that the basenode is created. Other stuff should at least be stuffed into an initializeNodes() method or the like and only called by the first active master on cluster startup.
Other components in HBase that want to also access ZK, things like rest, should be able to reuse ZKW and ZKUtil easily.
