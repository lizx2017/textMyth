Summary:
base64 encoded values are not contained in quotes during the HBase REST JSON serialization
Description:
base64 encoded values are having the quotes put around the values before the base64 encoding takes place. This renders improper JSON that some (all?) json parsers are unable to process.
The defect should be fixed in the agile-json jar available here:
http://github.com/gottesmm/agile-json-2.0/tree/master
I'm hoping to get to this before this weekend.
