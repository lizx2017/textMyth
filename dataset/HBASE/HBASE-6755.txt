Summary:
HRegion.internalObtainRowLock uses unecessary AtomicInteger
Description:
I was looking at HBase's implementation of locks and saw that is unnecessarily uses an AtomicInteger to obtain a unique lockid.
The observation is that we only need a unique one and don't care if we happen to skip one.
In a very unscientific test I saw the %system CPU reduced when the AtomicInteger is avoided.
