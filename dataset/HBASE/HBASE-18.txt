Summary:
[hbase] A sequence of create/delete/create/etc. generates 'info:regioninfo is empty; has keys:' and eventually fails
Description:
Marking as minor issue since its a concurrency issue in admin function. Though that said, this is a guaranteed way to generate rows in META that are without their regioninfo (Looks like we might add startcode and servername after a row has had its regioninfo removed).
Issue was found by Dave Simpson running a create/delete/create sequence. Attaching log.
