Summary:
Slow query log in trunk is too verbose
Description:
Running a YCSB workload against trunk, the slow query log ends up logging the entire contents of "mutate" RPCs (in PB-encoded binary). This then makes the logging back up, which makes more slow queries, which makes the whole thing spin out of control. We should only summarize the RPC, rather than printing the whole contents.
