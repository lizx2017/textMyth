Summary:
[hbase] Implement "ALTER TABLE ... CHANGE column" operation
Description:
Right now, you can add or delete column families, but not change them once they are created. This is really inconvenient for things like adding compression or bloom filters to a column family once you get going. As new people come to HBase, they're going to make schema decisions that are incorrect and will need a way to modify their tables, so this is an important new feature.
