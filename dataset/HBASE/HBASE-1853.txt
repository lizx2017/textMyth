Summary:
Each time around the regionserver core loop, we clear the messages to pass master, even if we failed to deliver them
Description:
At the head of the regionserver run loop we do this:
          synchronized(this.outboundMsgs) {
            outboundArray =
              this.outboundMsgs.toArray(new HMsg[outboundMsgs.size()]);
            this.outboundMsgs.clear();
          }
We do this even if we failed to deliver the message to the master â€“ Connection refused or whatever.
