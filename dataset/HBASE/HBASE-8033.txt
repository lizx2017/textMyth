Summary:
Break TestRestoreSnapshotFromClient into TestRestoreSnapshotFromClient and TestCloneSnapshotFromClient
Description:
Over in HBASE-8019, I broke TestRestoreSnapshotFromClient into TestRestoreSnapshotFromClient and TestCloneSnapshotFromClient which allowed build #889 to pass.
This JIRA does the same for 0.95 and trunk.
In the future, we can add more tests into these two classes without timing out Jenkins build.
