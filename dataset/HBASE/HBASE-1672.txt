Summary:
Map tasks not local to RS
Description:
The number of data local map tasks while scanning a table is only about 10% of the total map tasks...
My table had 280 regions and 13M records... The number of map tasks in the scan job were equal to the number of regions (280). Only 25 of them were data local tasks.
