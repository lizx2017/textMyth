Summary:
Minor bug in delete flow.
Description:
Timestamp updation in Delete flow is not considering all flavors (Delete record, Delete Family, Delete Column) of Delete API. Currently its considering Delete Record only.
org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.HRegion.prepareDeleteTimestamps(Delete, byte[])
      for (KeyValue kv: kvs) {
        //  Check if time is LATEST, change to time of most recent addition if so
        //  This is expensive.
        if (kv.isLatestTimestamp() && kv.isDeleteType()) {
Basically used a wrong API.
kv.isDeleteType() should be KeyValue.isDelete(type);
