Summary:
"Num compacting KVs" diverges from "num compacted KVs" over time
Description:
I have been running what amounts to an ingestion test for a day or so. This is an all-in-one cluster launched with './bin/hbase master start' from sources. In the RS stats on the master UI, the "num compacting KVs" has diverged from "num compacted KVs" even though compaction has been completed from perspective of selection, no compaction tasks are running on the RS. I think this could be confusing â€“ is compaction happening or not?
Or maybe I'm misunderstanding what this is supposed to show?
