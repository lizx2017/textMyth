Summary:
HBase table truncate semantics seems broken as "disable" table is now async by default.
Description:
The new async design for disable table seems to have caused a side effect on the truncate command. (IRC chat with jdcryans)
Apparent Cause:
"Disable" is now async by default. When truncate is called, the disable operation returns immediately and when the drop is called, the disable operation is still not completed. This results in HMaster.checkTableModifiable() throwing a TableNotDisabledException.
With earlier versions, disable returned only after Table was disabled.
