Summary:
Hadoop FileSystem changes in 0.21
Description:
Trying to get trunk running on hadoop 0.21 I noticed a few things:
FileSystem.listStatus() throws a FNF exception if the path does not exist.
FileSystem's finalizer has moved into a static internal Cache class, so the reflection hack in HRegionServer must be updated.
The attached patch got me up and running. Will not be ready for commit until trunk is going against hadoop 0.21
