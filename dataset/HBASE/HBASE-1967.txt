Summary:
[Transactional] client.TestTransactions.testPutPutScan fails sometimes
Description:
Testcase: testPutPutScan took 15.822 sec FAILED
expected:<299> but was:<199>
Not sure exactly how the test is supposed to work but it seems that sometimes the two Put are on the same timestamp so the value returned is 199. I will commit a temporary fix to branch in order to release 0.20.2
