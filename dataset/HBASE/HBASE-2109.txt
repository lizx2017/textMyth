Summary:
status 'simple' should show total requests per second, also the requests/sec is wrong as is
Description:
status 'simple' doesnt give us aggregate load, leaving the user to add up numbers by hand.
Futhermore, the per-server requests numbers are off, too high by a factor of 3 - they are using the default toString() which assumes a 1 second report rate, when the shipping default is 3 seconds.
