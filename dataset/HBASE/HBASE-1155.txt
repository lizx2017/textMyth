Summary:
Verify that FSDataoutputStream.sync() works
Description:
In order to guarantee that an HLog sync() flushes the data to the HDFS, we will need to invoke FSDataOutputStream.sync() per HADOOP-4379.
Currently, there is no access to the underlying FSDataOutputStream from SequenceFile.Writer, as it is a package private member.
