Summary:
Per-region WAL breaks CP backwards compatibility in 0.94 for non-enabled case
Description:
Moving from a single WAL to the possibility of multiple WALs, the method signature in RegionServerServices became:
  /** @return the HLog for a particular region. Pass null for getting the
   * default (common) WAL */
  public HLog getWAL(HRegionInfo regionInfo) throws IOException;
However, CPs that previously needed access to the WAL would just call:
RegionServerServices.getWAL();
Which is equivalent to calling:
RegionServerServices.getWAL(null);
but which requires a code change, recompilation, and possibly an additional compatibility layer for different versions of 0.94... not a great situation.
