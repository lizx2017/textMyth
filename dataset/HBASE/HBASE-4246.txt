Summary:
Cluster with too many regions cannot withstand some master failover scenarios
Description:
We ran into the following sequence of events:
master startup failed after only ROOT had been assigned (for another reason)
restarted the master without restarting other servers. Since there was at least one region assigned, it went through the failover code path
master scanned META and inserted every region into /hbase/unassigned in ZK.
then, it called "listChildren" on the /hbase/unassigned znode, and crashed with "Packet len6080218 is out of range!" since the IPC response was larger than the default maximum.
