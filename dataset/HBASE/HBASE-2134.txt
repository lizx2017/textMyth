Summary:
Ivy nit regarding checking with latest snapshots
Description:
Currently - if a new jar gets published in one of the dependent m2 snapshots - ivy does not retrieve it unless the cache is cleared. Add changing="true" to the dependency. ( There has to be an alternate way to do it at the resolver level, but for now this works without a hitch).
