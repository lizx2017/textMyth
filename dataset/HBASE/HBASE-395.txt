Summary:
[hbase] Refactor HStore and internal (and related) classes into hbase.store subpackage
Description:
HStore, the class responsible for managing data storage for column families within a region, is a very large class with more than a few internal classes. I propose moving HStore and HStoreFile into the hbase.store subpackage, and then moving internal classes out of HStore and into their own package-internal classes within the subpackage. This will make the code much more readable and manageable. In addition, it will help to logically delineate which classes are involved in managing a store.
