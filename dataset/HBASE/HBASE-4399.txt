Summary:
[REST] Update JSON examples
Description:
The JSON examples in the REST documentation were generated by specifying application/json encoding and then observing the result from Jersey and JAXB. Some time along the way the dependencies for parsing and producing JSON have changed and so the behavior has changed. The examples in the docs should be updated with what is produced and accepted by the latest.
