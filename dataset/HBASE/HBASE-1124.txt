Summary:
Balancer kicks in way too early
Description:
Balancer kicks in before all regions are assigned out. Causes confusion. Master won't accept OPENs from "overloaded" HRS. Master is slow to respond to UI and HRS during. Master sometimes takes too long to respond to a HRS heartbeat and so the HRS will reinit. This causes more confusion.
