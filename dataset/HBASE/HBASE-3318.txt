Summary:
Split rollback leaves parent with writesEnabled=false
Description:
I saw a split rollback today, and it left the region in a state where it was able to take writes, but wasn't able to flush or compact. It's printing this message every few milliseconds:
NOT flushing memstore for region xxx., flushing=false, writesEnabled=false
I see why, writesEnabled is never set back in HRegion.initialize:
// See if region is meant to run read-only.
if (this.regionInfo.getTableDesc().isReadOnly()) {
  this.writestate.setReadOnly(true);
}
Instead it needs to pass isReadOnly into the setReadOnly method to work correctly.
I think it should go in 0.90.0 if there's a new RC.
