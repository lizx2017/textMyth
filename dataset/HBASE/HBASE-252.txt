Summary:
Random reads in mapfile are ~40% slower in TRUNK than they are in 0.15.x
Description:
Opening a mapfile on hdfs and then doing 100k random reads inside the open file takes 3 times longer to complete in TRUNK than same test run on 0.15.x.
Random read performance is important to hbase.
Serial reads and writes perform about the same in TRUNK and 0.15.x.
Below are 3 runs done against 0.15 of the mapfile test that can be found in hbase followed by 2 runs done against TRUNK:
