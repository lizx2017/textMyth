Summary:
Problem with HBCK mergeOverlaps
Description:
In HDFSIntegrityFixer#mergeOverlaps(), there is a logic to create the final range of the region after the overlap.
I can see one issue with this code
            if (RegionSplitCalculator.BYTES_COMPARATOR
                    .compare(hi.getEndKey(), range.getSecond()) > 0) {
              range.setSecond(hi.getEndKey());
            }
Here suppose the regions include the end region for which the endKey will be empty, we need to get finally the range with endkey as empty byte[]
But as per the above logic it will see that any other key greater than the empty byte[] and will set it.
Finally the new region created will not get endkey as empty byte[]
