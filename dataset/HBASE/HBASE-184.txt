Summary:
[hbase] Replace all String.getBytes() with String.getBytes("UTF-8")
Description:
We cannot rely on the default encoding being UTF-8 so a naked String.getBytes() will return the bytes in whatever the default encoding is for the platform on which code is running. If it is subsequently read on another machine with a different default encoding, converting the bytes back to a string will result in garbage.
Consequently, we should always specify an encoding for getBytes() and new String. UTF-8 is the preferred encoding.
The places where we use unqualified getBytes are:
HConstants.DELETE_BYTES, HConstants.COMPLETE_CACHEFLUSH
hbase.io.MapWritable.main (but this will not be an issue once HADOOP-1760 is completed)
TestHMemcache.addRows
PerformanceEvaluation.generateValue
TestGet
TestHRegion
TestHBaseCluster
TestTableMapReduce
TestScanner2
TestRegExpRowFilter
TestRowFilterSet
