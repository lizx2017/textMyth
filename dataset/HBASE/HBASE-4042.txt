Summary:
TestDistributedLogSplitting broke on trunk
Description:
There's a couple of issues going on here. Its taken me a while to figure whats up and am still not done. Here's what I found so far:
+ The last test testWorkerAbort has been hanging because there is no one to process the log split the final assert is expecting completed; we've killed the lone RS that this test put up. This test passes most of the time for me locally; luck has the log processed before the RS with its splitLogWorker processes the log before we go out. Putting up a new RS with a splitLogWorker makes this test pass for me most of the time now but I've seen an error in testing so need to dig in still.
+ The first test, testThreeRSAbort is a good test. Its turning up a issue that has nothing to do w/ log splitting. If .META. is on one of the RSs that goes down – we launch w/ 6 RSs – then we get stuck in catalog tracker waiting on meta to be up again (though it deploys fin – we don't notice its deploy in master). I'm on this one at mo.
