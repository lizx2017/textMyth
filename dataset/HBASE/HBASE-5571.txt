Summary:
Table will be disabling forever
Description:
If we restart master when it is disabling one table, the table will be disabling forever.
In current logic, Region CLOSE RPC will always returned NotServingRegionException because RS has already closed the region before we restart master. So table will be disabling forever because the region will in RIT all along.
In another case, when AssignmentManager#rebuildUserRegions(), it will put parent regions to AssignmentManager.regions, so we can't close these parent regions until it is purged by CatalogJanitor if we execute disabling the table.
