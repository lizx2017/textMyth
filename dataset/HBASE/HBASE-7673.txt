Summary:
Incorrect error logging when a replication peer is removed
Description:
When a replication peer is removed (and all goes well), the following error is still logged:
[ERROR][14:14:21,504][ventThread] org.apache.hadoop.hbase.replication.regionserver.ReplicationSourceManager - The queue we wanted to close is missing peer-state
This is due to a watch being set on the peer-state node under the replication peer node in ZooKeeper, and the ReplicationSource#PeersWatcher doesn't correctly discern between nodes when it gets nodeDeleted messages.
