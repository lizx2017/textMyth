Summary:
Compaction algorithm should prioritize reference files
Description:
I got myself into a state where my table was un-splittable as long as the insert load was coming in. Emergency flushes because of the low memory barrier don't check the number of store files so it never blocks, to a point where I had in one case 45 store files and the compactions were almost never done on the reference files (had 15 of them, went down by one in 20 minutes). Since you can't split regions with reference files, that region couldn't split and was doomed to just get more store files until the load stopped.
Marking this as a minor issue, what we really need is a better pushback mechanism but not prioritizing reference files seems wrong.
