Summary:
get rid of scanner timeout
Description:
the client side code has this in ClientScanner.next():
if (e instanceof UnknownScannerException &&
lastNext + scannerTimeout < System.currentTimeMillis())
{ ScannerTimeoutException ex = new ScannerTimeoutException(); ex.initCause(e); throw ex; }
This will cause the client-side to timeout after the 'scannerTimeout'. There doesn't seem to be any good reason for this - we can just restart the scanner at the last row. Leave the server-side scanner as is, but clients should be able to have a 5 day scan that is continuously being restarted.
