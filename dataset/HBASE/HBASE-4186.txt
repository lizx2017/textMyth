Summary:
No region is added to regionsInTransitionInRS
Description:
We have a skip list set called regionsInTransitionInRS (introduced in HBASE-3741) where we try to maintain a list to know the currently processing regions for closing and opening.
In open region handler we are trying to throw an error if the regions are in transition on that RS when we get an open call for the same region.
But we are not adding the region into the set anywhere.
