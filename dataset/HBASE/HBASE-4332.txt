Summary:
Describing a disabled table displays the table as being ENABLED
Description:
On hbase 0.90.3, describing a table which is disabled, on hbase shell shows the table as being ENABLED i.e.
hbase> create 't1','c1'
hbase> describe 't1'
       DESCRIPTION ENABLED   
hbase> drop 't1'
       ERROR: Table t1 is enabled. Disable it first.'
hbase> disable 't1'
hbase> describe 't1'
       DESCRIPTION ENABLED   
hbase> drop 't1'
Table dropped
The describe option can be useful to know if the table is disabled/enabled. I looked through jiras to find if an issue already exists but could not find one. Please mark it as duplicate if one already exists.
