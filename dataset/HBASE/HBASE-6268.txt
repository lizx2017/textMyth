Summary:
Can't enable a table on a 0.94 cluster from a 0.92 client
Description:
In 0.92 we know a table's enabled by doing this in HCM.isEnabledTable:
return getTableState(zkw, tableName) == null;
In 0.94 we do:
return getTableState(zkw, tableName) == TableState.ENABLED;
So what happens is that the the 0.92 client will hang forever since the znode contains ENABLED instead of being absent.
