Summary:
NullPointerException when loadbalancer tries to close the region for reassigning to new RS.
Description:
1. Start 2 RS. Create some regions so that is is balanced.
2. Stop RS2. Now all the Regions from RS2 are assigned to RS1.
3. Again start RS2.
4. Load Balancing is calculated and few regions from RS1 are assigned to RS2.
As part of this step Master tries to unassign the regions from RS1.
          RegionTransitionData data = ZKAssign.getDataNoWatch(zkw, ZKAssign
              .getNodeName(zkw, region.getEncodedName()), null);
          if (data.equals(EventType.RS_ZK_REGION_CLOSING)) {
            ZKAssign.createNodeClosing(zkw, region, master.getServerName());
          }
Now there is no data present in the unassigned node. We are directly comparing the data.
Here data is null. Hence nullpointer exception is thrown.
Hence load balancing fails.
