Summary:
HMaster.getRegionTableClosest should not return null for closed regions
Description:
Raised in the review of HBASE-2560: there are a couple functions in HMaster which return null when a region has not been deployed. Instead, they should return a Pair<HRegionInfo, HServerAddress> where only the address is null (since the info is still in meta!)
