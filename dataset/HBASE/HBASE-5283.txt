RegionLoad.readRequestsCount and RegionLoad.writeRequestsCount are of int type. Our Ops has been running lots of heavy load operation. RegionLoad.getRequestsCount() overflows int.MAX_VALUE. It is set to D986E7E1. In table.jsp, RegionLoad.getRequestsCount() is assigned to long type. D986E7E1 is converted to long FFFFFFFFD986E7E1 which is -645470239 in decimal.
Suggested fix is to make readRequestsCount and writeRequestsCount long type.
