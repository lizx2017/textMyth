Summary:
Deleting and recreating a table in a single process does not work
Description:
When you delete and then recreate/enable the same table in the same process, when you get the HTable reference to the new table you are actually given the old table.
The connection information is never deleted/invalidated.
To fix, we add a call to HConnectionManager.deleteConnectionInfo(conf) at the end of HBaseAdmin.deleteTable(). This information will then be re-loaded with the latest table references once the client asks for it.
