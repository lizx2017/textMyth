Summary:
HBase code update 0.0.0-4
Description:
HClient
Added logic to detect when a region is no longer being served by the
cached region server
Prevent null pointer exception in the get methods because the server
can return null if the data is not found (contributed by Vuk Ercegovac)
Disallow creation of reserved table names
HLocking
Make the lock counter an AtomicInteger
HLog
Add some DEBUG logging
HMaster
Main processing loop did not sleep if there were no known region
servers (contributed by Vuk Ercegovac)
Move processing of kill list after processing all the incoming
region server messages
deleteTable prevents meta scanner from running so that there will be
no race condition between them. Previously, if deleteTable was in
the middle of processing and the meta scanner ran, it could detect a
region as unassigned and try to reassign it.
deleteTable does not update the kill list until it has finished
scanning a meta region. This will prevent lock contention on the
region server.
deleteTable will now delete any regions that are not being served
deleteTable removes unassigned regions from the "to be assigned list"
fix createTable so it correctly refuses to create a second table
with the same name as an existing table
HRegion
deleteRegion is a new static method
added isClosed method
closeAndDelete calls new deleteRegion method
added locking
HRegionInterface
getRegionInfo now throws NotServingRegionException
HRegionServer
split or compact checker skips a region if it is closed
cache flusher skips a region if it is closed
lessen amount of time closeAndDeleteRegion holds the HRegionServer
write lock
getRegionInfo now throws NotServingRegionException
moved checks for region being served to getRegion method (which
throws NotServingRegionException)
fixed bug in close in which the scanner was not actually getting closed
implements RegionUnavailableListener in splitOrCompactChecker
Leases
added some DEBUG logging
fixed bug in which the leaseCheckFrequency was not being set causing
the lease checker to spin and never sleep. (contributed by Vuk Ercegovac)
NotServingRegionException
new exception (extends IOException)
RegionUnavailableListener
new interface that enables split region to call back the caller just
before the old region is taken off-line
