Summary:
Runtime exceptions during meta scan
Description:
Version: 0.90.3 + patches back ported
The other day our client started spitting these two runtime exceptions. Not all clients connected to the cluster were under impact. Only 4 of them. While 3 of them were throwing NPE, one of them was throwing ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. The errors are :
1. http://pastie.org/2987926
2. http://pastie.org/2987927
Clients did not recover from this and I had to restart them.
Motive of this jira is to identify and put null checks at appropriate places. Also with the given stack trace I can not tell which line caused NPE of AIOBE, hence additional motive is to make the trace more helpful.
