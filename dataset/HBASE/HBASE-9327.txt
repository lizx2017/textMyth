Summary:
retryTime log is confusing
Description:
In the log we have this:
 (RpcRetryingCaller.java:callWithRetries(122)) - Call exception, tries=5, retries=35, retryTime=-21839ms
It looks like the retryTime is negative. Look the code, it is actually a warning message error. We also should use EnvironmentEdgeManager to be consistent.
