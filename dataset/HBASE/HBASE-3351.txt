Summary:
ReplicationZookeeper goes to ZK every time a znode is modified
Description:
While debugging other issues, I found that ReplicationAdmin.ReplicationStatusTracker is doing a ZK request every time a znode changes. Also reading the replication state shouldn't go to ZK if we already maintain a local variable that's updated with the tracker.
