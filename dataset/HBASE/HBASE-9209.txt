Summary:
[0.92] TestSplitTransactionOnCluster occasionally fails
Description:
There are some issues with this test fixed in later branches. It doesn't seem pressing to backport any of that work. Will resolve by disabling the test in the 0.92 branch. Please indicate if you prefer an alternate approach.
