Summary:
HTablePool -- Ride Over Restart
Description:
When ZK, Master, Regionserver and my app are running, I stop the Hbase master/regionserver. The HBaseClient then begins to complain:
16:26:51,273 INFO [HBaseClient] Retrying connect to server: /192.168.1.55:44808. Already tried 0 time(s).
16:26:53,274 INFO [HBaseClient] Retrying connect to server: /192.168.1.55:44808. Already tried 1 time(s).
...already tried 9 time(s)....
16:27:10,294 INFO [HbaseRPC] Server at /192.168.1.55:44808 not available yet, Zzzzz...
I restart the Master and RegionServer and then send more client requests through HTablePool. It has the same "Retrying to connect to server:" messages. I noticed that the port number it is using is the old port for the region server and not the new one assigned after the restart. The HbaseClient does not seem to recover unless I restart the client app. When I do not use HTablePool and only Htable it works fine.
When using HTablePool, the client doesn't seem to refresh with the new regionserver port after the master/regions are back up. It gets "stuck" with the info from the settings prior to the master going down. The ability to ride over a restart.
I would appreciate any thoughts or help.
