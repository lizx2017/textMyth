Summary:
When HTable goes away, close zk session in shutdown hook or something...
Description:
Currently, while there is a close on HTable, it does not let go of the zk session.. it does not call close... because the session is shared by all HTables in the VM. Add a shutdown hook that will close zk on the way out. Otherwise it makes for session timeouts in zk server logs.
