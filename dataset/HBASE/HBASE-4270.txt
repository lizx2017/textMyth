Summary:
IOE ignored during flush-on-close causes dataloss
Description:
If the RS experiences an exception during the flush of a region while closing it, it currently catches the exception, logs a warning, and keeps going. If the exception was a DroppedSnapshotException, this means that it will silently drop any data that was in memstore when the region was closed.
Instead, the RS should do a hard abort so that its logs will be replayed.
