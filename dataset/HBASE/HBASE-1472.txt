Summary:
Client/Server version mismatch exception message is inaccurate/misleading.
Description:
Attempting to connect to an HBase 0.19.1 server with the HBase 0.19.0 client jars raises an exception that states the HBase server is not running.
This is misleading; it should state that the server is running an incompatible version.
