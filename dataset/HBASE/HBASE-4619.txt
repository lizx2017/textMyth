Summary:
TableOutputFormat.close() interferes with HBase clients in same JVM
Description:
This appears in TableOutputFormat.java:
@Override
    public void close(TaskAttemptContext context)
    throws IOException {
      table.flushCommits();
      // The following call will shutdown all connections to the cluster from
      // this JVM.  It will close out our zk session otherwise zk wil log
      // expired sessions rather than closed ones.  If any other HTable instance
      // running in this JVM, this next call will cause it damage.  Presumption
      // is that the above this.table is only instance.
      HConnectionManager.deleteAllConnections(true);
    }
It's not a safe assumption that a single TableOutputFormat is the only HBase client in a JVM.
