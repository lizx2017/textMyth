Summary:
Table Coprocessor can't access external HTable by default
Description:
With the default configuration passed to a RegionCoprocessor environment, you cannot reach an HTable on the same cluster (at least in 0.94 - no verified yet in 0.96/8). The reason is in the usage of CompoundConfiguration (backported to 0.94 in HBASE-8176) when loading a table coprocessor we just do (RegionCoprocessorHost, ln 182):
Configuration newConf = new Configuration(conf);
// set per-table cfspec properties
but the conf we pass in a CompoundConfiguration, which means the copy constructor from Configuration doesn't work at all.
So, we really need two things:
1. A test that we can reach another HTable in the same cluster via a coprocessor by default
2. Fixing the configuration creation in RegionCoprocessorHost to support (1)
