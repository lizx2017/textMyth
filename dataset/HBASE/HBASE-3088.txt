Summary:
TestAvroServer and TestThriftServer broken because use same table in all tests and tests enable/disable/delete
Description:
There is dross left up in zk when you disable a table so if you go create same table name in new test, it'll fail to enable because zk says table disabled. Clean up any table mentions in memory and up in zk on delete of a table (as well as all the other stuff we do on table delete).
