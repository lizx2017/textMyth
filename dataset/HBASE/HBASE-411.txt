Summary:
Fix fact that hadoop must be first on the CLASSPATH
Description:
Currently, hadoop jar must be first on the CLASSPATH. If its not found first, on startup we get complaint that the hadoop webapps can't be found. Has to do w/ fact that the webapp is supposed to be in the jar thats doing the class loading (There was a fix up in core but needs fixup/cleanup).
