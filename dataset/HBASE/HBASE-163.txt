Summary:
Support updates across region splits and compactions
Description:
Running an extended serial write test (EvaluationClient), a test that runs long enough it triggers compactions and splits, hbase falls over. In the former case, client gets locked out. In the latter, the client times out.
During compactions, hbase should be able to continue to take writes/updates. During splits, the client will have to recalibrate so writes go instead into the new splits but again, other than a pause, writes shouldn't be dropped.
