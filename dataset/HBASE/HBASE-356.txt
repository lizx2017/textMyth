Summary:
[HbaseShell] Addition of HQL (Hbase Query Language) support in Hbase Shell
Description:
We have defined the HQL (Hbase Query Language), which is a "more" SQL-like query language for Hbase, for use in Hbase Shell. HQL is not intended to fully support the SQL syntax and semantics. HQL, instead, is developed to make it easy to manipulate tables in Hbase through the Hbase Shell command line, without using programming APIs.
You can find more information about HQL in http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-hadoop/Hbase/HbaseShell/HQL.
