Summary:
Backup master will never come up if primary master dies during initialization
Description:
The problem happens if primary master dies after becoming master but before it completes initialization and calls clusterStatusTracker.setClusterUp(),
The backup master will try to become the master, but will shutdown itself promptly because it sees 'the cluster is not up'.
This is the backup master log:
