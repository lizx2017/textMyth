Summary:
Exception handling in HBase is broken over client server connections
Description:
When an exception is thrown in a server process, the Hadoop Server class passes the exception class name and error message across the wire to the Hadoop Client. The Hadoop Client then throws a RemoteException with the class name and error message as part of its payload. Thus an interface like:
public HRegionInfo getRegionInfo(final Text regionName) throws NotServingRegionException;
actually throws a RemoteException on the client with org.apache.hadoop.hbase.NotServingRegionException as the class name and the remote message as the message.
Anywhere in the HBase code where we try to catch NotServingRegionException will thus never see it if it came across an RPC.
