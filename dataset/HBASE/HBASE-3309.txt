Summary:
" Not running balancer because dead regionserver processing" is a lie
Description:
When running the balancer I see the message:
 Not running balancer because dead regionserver processing
But that's not true, it does run, because the check is wrong:
if (!this.serverManager.areDeadServersInProgress()) {
  LOG.debug("Not running balancer because dead regionserver processing");
}
Also it doesn't return false like it should.
