Summary:
Exceptions in multi operations are not handled correctly
Description:
The symptoms are that, both ITBLL and ITLAV fail in their verification steps complaining about lots of undefined rows.

                REFERENCED=199619372
                UNDEFINED=190084
                UNREFERENCED=190084
I think the problem is in HRegionServer.doBatchOp() where in case HRegion.batchMutate() throws an exception, RegionActionResult indexes are not set correctly.
