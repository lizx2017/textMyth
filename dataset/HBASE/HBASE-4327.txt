Summary:
Compile HBase against hadoop 0.22
Description:
Pom contains a profile for hadoop-0.20 and one for hadoop-0.23, but not one for hadoop-0.22.
When overriding hadoop.version to 0.22, then the (compile-time) dependency on hadoop-annotations cannot be met.
That exists on 0.23 and 0.24/trunk, but not on 0.22.
