Summary:
HTablePool Constructor may cause unintended behavior
Description:
HTablePool.java
96   public HTablePool(final Configuration config, final int maxSize,
97       final HTableInterfaceFactory tableFactory) {
98     this(config, maxSize, null, PoolType.Reusable);
99   }
I think that 3rd argument in line 98 should be "tableFactory".
