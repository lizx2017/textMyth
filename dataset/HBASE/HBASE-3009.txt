Summary:
ICV-style update of Memstore for single-qualifier and frequent puts
Description:
We had an internal need for a method to update a single cell thousands of times per second without having a "versions explosion" problem, and found that the code can be somewhat easily modified for that by reusing Store.updateColumnValue and making it accept byte[]. I'm putting the patch here in case someone else finds it useful, and maybe it can eventually make its way into the source.
