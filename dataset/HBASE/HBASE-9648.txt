Summary:
collection one expired storefile causes it to be replaced by another expired storefile
Description:
There's a shortcut in compaction selection that causes the selection of expired store files to quickly delete.
However, there's also the code that ensures we write at least one file to preserve seqnum. This new empty file is "expired", because it has no data, presumably.
So it's collected again, etc.
This affects 94, probably also 96.
