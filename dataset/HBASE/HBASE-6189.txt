Summary:
Snappy build instructions are out of date
Description:
In the ref guide (http://hbase.apache.org/book.html#build.snappy), it says to build snappy by passing -Dsnappy. Something's wrong here, because:
1. this causes the build to fail because the hadoop-snappy tar artifact can't be found by maven
2. the snappy classes are already included in hadoop 1.0, so using the snappy profile is unnecessary
It would be great if someone who knows when/why to use the snappy profile could fix the instructions (and fix the POM if necessary).
