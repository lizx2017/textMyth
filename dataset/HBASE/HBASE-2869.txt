Regularize how we log sequenceids -- sometimes its myseqid, other times its sequence id, etc.
Description:
I'm trying to trace sequenceids over time to make sure all is working properly over crashes, etc., in an HRS and its way too painful. Regularize how we log so whenever a sequence id is mentioned in logs its named sequenceid.
