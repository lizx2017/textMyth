Summary:
Hbase wants to have large heaps, GC wants to touch every object in heap
Description:
HBase wants to have large heaps - store lots of cached objects to make things faster in RAM.
But Java garbage collection wants to touch every object in heap.
How does this work at 3gb heaps? 6gb heaps? The more ram we can use in HBase the better performance we can get. If java GC holds us back, we might need to do something else.
