Summary:
Code generation does run under m2eclipse
Description:
When going through the instructions on http://hbase.apache.org/book/ides.html, the build will fail in eclipse because none of the sources are generated. After looking at our pom and reading http://wiki.eclipse.org/M2E_compatible_maven_plugins, we are telling m2eclipse to ignore the avro and jamon plugins.
