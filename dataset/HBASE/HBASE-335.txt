Summary:
[Hbase Shell] Relational Algrebra Operators
Description:
Development of relational algebra operators has begun.
Projection
selects a subset of the columnfamilies of a relation
Result = π column_list (Relation)
Hbase > Result = Relation.Projection('year','legnth');
Hbase > save Result into table('result');
Selection
See : HADOOP-2003 issue's description
Hbase > Result = Relation.Selection(length > 100 and studioName = 'Fox'); 
Hbase > save Result into table('result');
Group
more details about 'GROUP' operation will be handled in HADOOP-1658 issue.
θ Join
The join of two relations R1(A 1,A 2,...,A n) and R2(B 1,B 2,...,B m) is a relation with degree k=n+m and attributes (A 1,A 2,...,A n, B 1,B 2,...,B m) that satisfy the join condition
Hbase > R1 = table('movieLog_table');
Hbase > R2 = table('personInfo_table');
Hbase > Result = R1.join(R1.producer: = R2.ROW) and R2; 
     or Result = R1.join(R1.actor:hero = R2.Row) and R2;
     or Result = R1.join(R1.actor:hero = R2.Row and R1.studioName = 'Fox' and R2.occupation = 'singer') and R2;
