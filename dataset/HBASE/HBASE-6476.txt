Summary:
Replace all occurrances of System.currentTimeMillis() with EnvironmentEdge equivalent
Description:
There are still some areas where System.currentTimeMillis() is used in HBase. In order to make all parts of the code base testable and (potentially) to be able to configure HBase's notion of time, this should be generally be replaced with EnvironmentEdgeManager.currentTimeMillis().
How hard would it be to add a maven task that checks for that, so we do not introduce System.currentTimeMillis back in the future?
