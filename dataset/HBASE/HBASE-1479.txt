Summary:
signal handler not working on regionserver: hbase-daemon.sh stop regionserver
Description:
I'm not clear whats going on here – will improve logging in meantime so can get a better picture – but short story is that a stop regionserver was done when regionserver was in reportForDuty and we never exited this state.
Here is longer story:
Regionserver is stuck cycling in reportForDuty. shutdown handler should be setting the stop flag so we should be breaking out of the loop but we dont' seem to be doing that. I can see start of the shutdown thread message... but not the ending message as it joins on main thread waiting on it to go down.
