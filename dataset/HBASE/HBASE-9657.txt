Summary:
Race condition in low replication checking and FSHLog#rollWriter()
Description:
In FSHLog#syncer(), we have this comment:
      // TODO: preserving the old behavior for now, but this check is strange. It's not
      //       protected by any locks here, so for all we know rolling locks might start
      //       as soon as we enter the "if". Is this best-effort optimization check?
      if (!this.logRollRunning) {
        checkLowReplication();
The implication is that checkLowReplication() may be running when FSHLog#rollWriter() is also running.
