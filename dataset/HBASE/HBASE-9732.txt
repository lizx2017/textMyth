Summary:
Static AtomicLong updated in StoreFileScanner every (re)seek
Description:
To verify a single test case, we update a static AtomicLong for every seek performed on a RegionServer. This is especially bad with multiple seeks going on at the same time.
W.T.F...?
This penalty should only be incured when we're actually testing and need to count the seeks.
