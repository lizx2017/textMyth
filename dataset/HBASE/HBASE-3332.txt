Summary:
Regions stuck in transition after RS failure
Description:
Testing 0.90rc2 I ran into this issue. The test scenario was to kill -9 the server hosting ROOT and META, and before it had been detected, run "balancer" from the shell. After logs were split and regions were reassigned, I ended up with some regions stuck in transition.
