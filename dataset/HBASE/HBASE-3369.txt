Summary:
We should use HBaseClient.call() that has parallelism built in
Description:
the HBaseClient supports a call like so:
public Writable[] call(Writable[] params, InetSocketAddress[] addresses)
And we are able to dispatch and retrieve multiple requests without threads. We should try to use this instead of using thread pools.
