Summary:
No durability when running with LocalFileSystem
Description:
LocalFileSystem in Hadoop doesn't currently implement sync(), so when we're running in that case, we don't have any durability. This isn't a huge deal since it isn't a realistic deployment scenario, but it's probably worth documenting. It caused some confusion for a user when a table disappeared after killing a standalone instance that was hosting its data in the local FS.
