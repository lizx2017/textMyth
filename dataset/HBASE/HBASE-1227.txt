Summary:
REST server ignores start_row and end_row arguments in scanner request
Description:
When issuing a command like:
POST /api/users/scanner?column=habbit:football&start_row=Alice&end_row=Bob
The resultant scanner appears to ignore the start_row and end_row constraints, so that a command like:
POST /api/users/scanner/1?limit=1000
returns results outside of the specified range e.g. the row for "William" will be returned.
