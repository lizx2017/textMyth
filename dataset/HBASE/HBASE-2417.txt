Summary:
HCM.locateRootRegion fails hard on "Connection refused"
Description:
While running some tests on replication, I saw that our client does something dumb if it tries to contact a dead region server that held the ROOT region in HCM.locateRootRegion. Will post stack trace in a comment.
The problem here is that we don't retry at all, the exception will come straight out of HCM like it's the end of the world.
