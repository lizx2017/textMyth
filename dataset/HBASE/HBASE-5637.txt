Summary:
Fix failing 0.90 TestHMsg testcase introduced by HBASE-5563.
Description:
After committing HBASE-5128 and HBASE-5563 to the 0.90 branch, Ted noticed that TestHMsg#getList started to fail consistently. This updates the test to deal with the updated equality semantics in HBASE-5563. This fixes that.
