Summary:
TestHBaseFsck#testQuarantineMissingFamdir fails sporadically
Description:
It was only test to fail in See <https://builds.apache.org/job/HBase-TRUNK/3928/changes> and just now in https://builds.apache.org/job/HBase-TRUNK/3928/testReport/org.apache.hadoop.hbase.util/TestHBaseFsck/testQuarantineMissingFamdir/
This has been seen for a while (August 2012 according to internal issue yet to be fixed).
I'm going to disable it for now until it gets some loving.
