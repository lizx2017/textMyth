Summary:
ModifyTable does not modify the attributes of a newly modified/changed ColumnDescriptor
Description:
This issue (if it is an expected behaviour I can close this) exists in all versions.
If i do modifyColumn and change an HCDs parameter I am able to get back the modified HCD with the latest data.
But when i do modifyTable and in that modify an HCD parameter say for eg. the SCOPE of it then as we don't persist the HCD information as in TableModifyFamilyHandler used for modifycolumn
  HTableDescriptor htd =
      this.masterServices.getMasterFileSystem().modifyColumn(tableName, familyDesc);
we are not able to get the updated HCD information on the RegionServer. So incases of replication where I need to modify the HCD's scope we are not able to make the replication happen.
