Summary:
HBase scripts ignore any HBASE_OPTS set in the environment
Description:
hbase-env.sh which is sourced by hbase-config.sh which is eventually sourced by the main 'hbase' script defines HBASE_OPTS form scratch, ignoring any previous value set in the environment.
This prevents from passing additional JVM parameters to HBase programs (shell, hbck, etc) launched through these scripts.
