Summary:
[WINDOWS] TestFromClientSide failures
Description:
The following tests fail for TestFromClientSide:
testPoolBehavior()
testClientPoolRoundRobin()
testClientPoolThreadLocal()
The first test fails due to the fact that the test (wrongly) assumes that ThredPoolExecutor can reclaim the thread immediately.
The second and third tests seem to fail because that Put's to the table does not specify an explicit timestamp, but on windows, consecutive calls to put happen to finish in the same milisecond so that the resulting mutations have the same timestamp, thus there is only one version of the cell value.
