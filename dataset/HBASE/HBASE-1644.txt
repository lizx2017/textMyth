Summary:
Result.row is cached in getRow; this breaks MapReduce
Description:
In Result#getRow row field is computed (if row is null) and then is cached for further uses. But since MapReduce uses the same Result instance through different map()/reduce() calls, row field is not updated when Result instance changes.
