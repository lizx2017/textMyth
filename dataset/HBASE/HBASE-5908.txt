Summary:
TestHLogSplit.testTralingGarbageCorruptionFileSkipErrorsPasses should not use append to corrupt the HLog
Description:
TestHLogSplit.testTralingGarbageCorruptionFileSkipErrorsPasses fails against a version of hadoop with https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-8230
The failure:
"java.io.IOException: Append is not supported. Please see the dfs.support.append configuration parameter."
Instead of using append, we can probably just:
copy over the contents to a new file
append the garbage to the new file
copy back to the old file
