Summary:
Bring up master UI even if .META. and -ROOT- not deployed; add status message to front of master ui (recovering server X, etc.)
Description:
I went to visit some fellas today who'd yanked the hdfs out from under their 80-node hbase because of an emergency. Interestingly, the maser was reporting 80 dead servers and no live servers. It couldn't recover because hdfs was gone.
On restart, the master had 80 server's logs to replay. There is a code-path we follow on startup where all is suspended until ALL logs are split which in this case of 80*(15-20 wals each) was taking a long time. To the administrator who is just getting started on hbase, tailing master log, it didn't look like it was making progress so he kept killing master, and so on.
The gentleman suggested that if the web UI had come up and said roughly what it was about w/ perhaps a bit of a progress message he'd not have been so disorientated.
This issue is about making it so web ui comes up even if no regionservers – i.e. meta and root not deployed – and adding a rough status message (splitting logs on dead server X, etc.)
