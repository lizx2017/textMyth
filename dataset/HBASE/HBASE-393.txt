Summary:
[hbase] Keeping MapFile.Reader open is expensive: Part 2
Description:
In hbase, a mapfile.Reader can be opened and a long period of time may pass before any accesses are made against the file. It can also be the case that a MapFile will be opened and never accessed. For every open unaccessed MapFile – i.e. next or a record at some offset hasn't been pulled – we'll consume two sockets in datanode, etc.
