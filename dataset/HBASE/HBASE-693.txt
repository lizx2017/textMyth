Summary:
TestGet2::testGetClosestRowBefore() failed with NPE after HADOOP-3472
Description:
After HADOOP-3472, MapFile.getClosest(.., ..., true) gives the correct value.
In the unit test, we have
10
20
30
35 <== deleted
40
in the MapFile. so in HStore.java's rowAtOrBeforeFromMapFile(MapFile.reader, bytes, ...)
readkey = (HStoreKey)map.getClosest(searchKey, readval, true);
it gets the deleted key 35. So it can not be added into candidateKeys.
The next key is 40, which is after the search key 38. So, we ends up
with empty candidateKeys. Therefore, we lastKey() is null. cause TestGet2.java
line 236 failed with NPE.
Since MapFile.Reader has no prev(key) method, not sure what's the best
to do in HStore.java.
