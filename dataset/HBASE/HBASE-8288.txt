Summary:
HBaseFileSystem: Refactoring and correct semantics for createPath methods
Description:
This jira is for two issues I see in the HBaseFileSystem class:
1) Load testing on a 7 node cluster using ycsb insert workload shows that static initialization of conf properties results in a slightly better throughput. Though the initialization uses HBaseConfiguration.create() call which is expensive (and I tried to avoid that in its first version), this class is used for most of the filesystem class, and had to invoke an additional checkAndSetXX call before making the fs call because it is not certain whether the retry properties are set or not. Having initialize them in static block removes that limitation.
2) Correct semantics for CreatePathXXX method. In case the overwrite flag is false and file already exists, underlying fs throws an exception. It should be re-thrown to the caller.
