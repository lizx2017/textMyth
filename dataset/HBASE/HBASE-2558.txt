Summary:
[mvn] Our javadoc overview -- "Getting Started", requirements, etc. -- is not carried across by mvn javadoc:javadoc target
Description:
I see this http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MJAVADOC-278 which does not bode well. I messed around upping the plugin version and explicitly specifying the overview.html file to use but no luck. Come back and figure this or an alternative.
Made it a blocker.
