Summary:
[replication] The replication-executor should make sure the file that it is replicating is closed before declaring success on that file
Description:
I have seen cases where the replication-executor would lose data to replicate since the file hasn't been closed yet. Upon closing, the new data becomes visible. Before that happens the ZK node shouldn't be deleted in ReplicationSourceManager.logPositionAndCleanOldLogs. Changes need to be made in ReplicationSource.processEndOfFile as well (currentPath related).
