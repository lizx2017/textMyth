Summary:
TestSplitTransactionOnCluster fails on occasion when it tries to move a region
Description:
TestSplitTransactionOnCluster tries to have meta on one server and table region on a different server. If the luck of the draw has the table and meta on same server, it'll move the table region elsewhere. This has been failing since hbase-4300 because we've been doing HBaseAdmin#move passing versioned ServerName bytes when HBaseAdmin#move expects the raw, unversioned bytes.
