Summary:
getRow does not always work when specifying number of versions
Description:
When a cell that exists is updated, getRow specifying number of versions does not work.
What is returned is the original value at that timestamp, instead of the updated value.
Note that this only applies when more than one version is specified. getRow with (implied) timestamp = latest does work.
