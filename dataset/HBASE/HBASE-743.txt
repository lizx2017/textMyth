Summary:
bin/hbase migrate upgrade fails when redo logs exists
Description:
I migrated several hbase-0.1.3 instances to hbase trunk and even if I stop hbase-0.1.3 cleanup it leaves redo logs on hdfs. The problems is that when migrating the data with hbase-trunk it fails because it finds these redo-logs and quit with a error message saying that we should reinstall the old hbase and shut it down cleanly and that in theory it erases the redo logs. The work around has been to delete the redo logs manually... which is bad.
