Summary:
midkey() returns 12 extra bytes in HFile v2
Description:
HFile's midkey() is implemented as the first key of the middle index block both HFile v1 and HFile v2 (the middle leaf index block is used in v2). However, in HFile v2 midkey() currently grabs 12 more bytes from the next leaf index entry, representing the offset and compressed size of the data block pointed to by that entry. While this probably does not affect the interpretation of the returned buffer as an HBase key (the last 12 bytes are simply discarded), this has to be cleaned up.
