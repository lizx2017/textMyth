Summary:
rolling-restart.sh script unable to check expiration of master znode
Description:
When rolling-restart.sh script stop master it enters loop trying to detect that master znode is deleted. Since it is unable to execute check command script hangs in infinite loop. Problematic line of script is:
while ! bin/hbase zkcli stat $zmaster 2>&1 | grep "Node does not exist"; do
"bin/hbase zkcli stat" can not be executed since script is run from bin directory. My suggestion is that this line should be like this in order to work:
while ! "$bin"/hbase zkcli stat $zmaster 2>&1 | grep "Node does not exist"; do
After i made this change i was able to execute rolling restart.
