Summary:
[replication] ReplicationSource won't cleanup logs if there's nothing to replicate
Description:
ReplicationSource only calls ReplicationSourceManager.logPositionAndCleanOldLogs if it replicated something, meaning that a region server that doesn't host a region with replicable edits will read through the logs but never report the position in zookeeper and won't clean the processed hlogs. This happened on one cluster here and shutting down a region server took a few minutes just to delete all the znodes.
