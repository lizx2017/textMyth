Summary:
[WINDOWS] Multicast should bind to local address
Description:
Binding to a multicast address (such as "hbase.status.multicast.address.ip") seems to be the preferred method on most unix systems and linux(2,3). At least in RedHat, binding to multicast address might not filter out other traffic coming to the same port, but for different multi cast groups (2)]. However, on windows, you cannot bind to a non local (class D) address (1), which seems to be correct according to the spec.

The solution is to bind to mcast address on linux, but a local address on windows.
TestHCM is also failing because of this.
