Summary:
Master should fail to start if it cannot successfully split logs
Description:
In trunk, in splitLogAfterStartup(), we log the error splitting, but don't shut down. Depending on configuration, we should probably shut down here rather than continue with dataloss.
In 0.20, we print the stacktrace to stdout in verifyClusterState, but continue through and often fail to start up
