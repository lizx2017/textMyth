Summary:
New idx javadoc not included with the rest
Description:
I just figured that the new idx package javadoc isn't included in the normal build process. I think we should fix that for 0.20.4 but still regenerate the javadoc for 0.20.3 and add it to the website. It's out of the normal release process so please discuss, I'm obviously +1 on this.
