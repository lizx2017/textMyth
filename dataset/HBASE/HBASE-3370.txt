Summary:
ReplicationSource.openReader fails to locate HLogs when they aren't split yet
Description:
In ReplicationSource.openReader there's a special handling of HLogs location during a failover and it's currently broken as it will retry 10 times and if the log splitting isn't done by then then it will skip the file forever.
First issue is that it looks at the chain of failovers but not the oldest one.
Second issue is that the location is found starting from the current RS's folder, instead of the dead RS's folder.
