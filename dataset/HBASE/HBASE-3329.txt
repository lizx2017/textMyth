Summary:
HLog splitting after RS/cluster death should directly create HFiles
Description:
After a RS dies or the cluster goes down and we are recovering, we first split HLogs into the logs for the regions. Then the region servers that host the regions replay the logs and open the regions.
This can be made more efficient by directly creating HFiles from the HLogs (instead of producing a split HLogs file).
