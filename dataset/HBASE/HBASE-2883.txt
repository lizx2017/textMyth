Summary:
Req/sec in web UIs are way off when regions are moving
Description:
Now that the region servers can heartbeat back to the master as soon as they have a message (region open, close, etc), they also recompute their metrics. I see two problems:
The metrics are recomputed way too often, and by the looks of that code it seems quite intense.
Our UIs are expecting that the value returned by the metrics computation is per second, but when regions are moving a RS can ping back a few times within a single second. This gives a very wrong view of the load.
I think it's time we move metrics computation in it's own separate thread.
