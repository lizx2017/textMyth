Summary:
Rolling restart RSs scenario, regions could stay in OPENING state
Description:
Keep Master up all the time, do rolling restart of RSs like this - stop RS1, wait for 2 seconds, stop RS2, start RS1, wait for 2 seconds, stop RS3, start RS2, wait for 2 seconds, etc. Region sometimes can just stay in OPENING state even after timeoutmonitor period.

The issue - RS was shutdown when a region is being opened, it was transitioned to RS_ZK_REGION_FAILED_OPEN in ZK. In timeoutmonitor, it didn't take care of RS_ZK_REGION_FAILED_OPEN.
