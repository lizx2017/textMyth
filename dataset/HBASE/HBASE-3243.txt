Summary:
Disable Table closed region on wrong host
Description:
I ran some YCSB benchmarks which resulted in about 150 regions worth of data overnight. Then I disabled the table, and the master for some reason closed one region on the wrong server. The server ignored this, but the region remained open on a different server, which later flipped out when it tried to flush due to hlog accumulation.
