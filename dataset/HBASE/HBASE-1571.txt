Summary:
HBaseClient.Connection.sendParam is not synchronized, which may lead to an NPE
Description:
Suppose that two threads are concurrently calling HBaseClient.getConnection() to an address to which no connection has been made yet, or one existed but has been dropped due to an error.
One of the threads creates a Connection object, puts it into the 'connections' map, and there, starts doing setupIOStreams, and there goes a context switch.
The second thread also calls getConnection and gets a connection from the 'connections' map, whose 'out' stream is only going to be initialized by the second thread, but has not yet been. There, at synchronized(this.out), goes an NPE.
