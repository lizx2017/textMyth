Summary:
Include javadoc and book when site goal invoked
Description:
Our pom builds javadoc and book in the pre-site step. A copy-resources tries to copy the javadoc and book to the site dir but it also does it at pre-site time. Maven does not let you specify the order in which these run. Whats happening is that the copy is happening before the book and javadoc are generated so though javadoc and book are built, they are not being included.
