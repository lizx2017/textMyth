Summary:
HTableDescriptor Properties not preserved when cloning
Description:
When cloning a snapshot to a new table the values[1] set on the original HTableDescriptor are not preserved.
This is because the values are not pulled off and set in the RestoreSnapshotHelper.cloneTableSchema(..)[2] method.
This affects a number of things such as custom properties but also for configured coprocessors for the table.
