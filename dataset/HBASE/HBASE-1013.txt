Summary:
Add debugging around commit log cleanup
Description:
Yesterday, streamy replayed 1000 logs. This seems too many for any one regionserver to be carrying. Its hard to tell if the 1000 logs were legit though because our logging isn't detailed enough. This issue is about adding detail around log cleaning so we can see how many logs are to be cleaned and which region the last edit belongs to.
