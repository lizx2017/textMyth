Summary:
[hbase] Run REST servlet outside of master
Description:
In order to support desired deployment strategy, we need to be able to run the REST servlet independently of the master info server. We should add an new option to the bin/hbase command ("rest"?) that optionally takes a port and bind address and starts the servlet outside of any other project.
