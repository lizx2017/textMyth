Summary:
HLogSplitter renaming recovered.edits and CJ removing the parent directory race, making the HBCK think cluster is inconsistent.
Description:
The scenario is like this
-> A region is getting splitted.
-> The master is still not processed the split .
-> Region server goes down.
-> Split log manager starts splitting the logs and creates the recovered.edits in the splitlog path.
-> CJ starts and deletes the entry from META and also just completes the deletion of the region dir.
-> in hlogSplitter on final step we rename the recovered.edits to come under the regiondir.
There if the regiondir doesnot exist we tend to create and then add the recovered.edits.
Because of this HBCK thinks it to be an orphan region because we have the regiondir but with no regioninfo.
Ideally cluster is fine but we it is misleading.
