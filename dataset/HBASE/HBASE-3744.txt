Summary:
createTable blocks until all regions are out of transition
Description:
In HBASE-3305, the behavior of createTable was changed and introduced this bug: createTable now blocks until all regions have been assigned, since it uses BulkStartupAssigner. BulkStartupAssigner.waitUntilDone calls assignmentManager.waitUntilNoRegionsInTransition, which waits across all regions, not just the regions of the table that has just been created.
We saw an issue where one table had a region which was unable to be opened, so it was stuck in RegionsInTransition permanently (every open was failing). Since this was the case, waitUntilDone would always block indefinitely even though the newly created table had been assigned.
