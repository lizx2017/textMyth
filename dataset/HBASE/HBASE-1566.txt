Summary:
using Scan(startRow,stopRow) will cause you to iterate the entire table
Description:
Right now the only way for the client scanner to know that we are at the 'end' of a scan is to client-side-wise use the filter to figure this out.
This is not easy to fix because the server is unable to indicate the difference between 'done with this region', and 'you're at the end of your scan'. In both cases we return 0 results, and the client can't figure out what it means.
Right now the best solution is to use filters, which is tricky since there is no StopRowFilter because that functionality is built in
We might have to hack the 'stop row' functionality as a filter until we can improve the client-server API/RPC.
