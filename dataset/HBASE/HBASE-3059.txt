Summary:
TestReadWriteConsistencyControl occasionally hangs
Description:
The test hung when I ran mvn test today. The jstack shows that a Writer thread hung at
"Thread-1" prio=10 tid=0x00002aaad81d2800 nid=0x6ce9 in Object.wait() [0x0000000040f37000]
java.lang.Thread.State: WAITING (on object monitor) at java.lang.Object.wait(Native Method)
at org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.ReadWriteConsistencyControl.completeMemstoreInsert(ReadWriteConsistencyControl.java:130)
â€“ locked <0x00002aaac9fa0f50> (a java.lang.Object)
at org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.TestReadWriteConsistencyControl$Writer.run(TestReadWriteConsistencyControl.java:56) at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:619)
It seems to be caused by a race condition in ReadWriteConsistencyControl#completeMemStoreInsert. Accesses/updates of the value of memStoreRead should be done while holding the readWaiters lock.
