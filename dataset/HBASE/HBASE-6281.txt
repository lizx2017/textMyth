Summary:
Assignment need not be called for disabling table regions during clean cluster start up.
Description:
Currently during clean cluster start up if there are tables in DISABLING state, we do bulk assignment through assignAllUserRegions() and after region is OPENED in RS, master checks if the table is in DISBALING/DISABLED state (in Am.regionOnline) and again calls unassign. This roundtrip can be avoided even before calling assignment.
This JIRA is to address the above scenario.
