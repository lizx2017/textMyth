Summary:
Build fails on Windows if user is logged into a domain
Description:
Build fails due to invalid output by saveVersion.sh:
user=`whoami` results in the string "domain\user" which is an invalid escape sequence down the line (or something else bad). I tried to figure out how to use sed to escape the backslash, but failed miserably and just removed the whoami altogether to workaround.
