Summary:
RPC code requires cellBlockCodecClass even though one is defined by default
Description:
The protobuf definition provides a default value:
// This is sent on connection setup after the connection preamble is sent.
message ConnectionHeader {
  [...]
  optional string cellBlockCodecClass = 3 [default = "org.apache.hadoop.hbase.codec.KeyValueCodec"];
  // Compressor we will use if cell block is compressed.  Server will throw exception if not supported.
  // Class must implement hadoop's CompressionCodec Interface
  [...]
}
Yet if one doesn't explicitly set a value, the code was rejecting the connection.
