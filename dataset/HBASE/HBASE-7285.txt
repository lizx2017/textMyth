Summary:
HMaster fails to start with secure Hadoop
Description:
In current trunk, HMaster will fail to start with secure Hadoop if the user starting the process has not obtained a kerberos TGT. The user starting the process should not be required to have a TGT, as the HMaster process self logs in using the configured keytab and principal.
This is due to a log line in the HMaster constructor executing prior to the User.login() step:
    LOG.info("hbase.rootdir=" + FSUtils.getRootDir(this.conf) +
        ", hbase.cluster.distributed=" + this.conf.getBoolean("hbase.cluster.distributed", false));
Here the FSUtils.getRootDir() winds up hitting the NameNode. The fix is trivial, moving the log line to follow User.login().
