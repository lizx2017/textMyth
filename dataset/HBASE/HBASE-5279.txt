Summary:
NPE in Master after upgrading to 0.92.0
Description:
I have upgraded my environment from 0.90.4 to 0.92.0
after the table migration I get the following error in the master (permanent)
2012-01-25 18:23:48,648 FATAL master-namenode,60000,1327512209588 org.apache.hadoop.hbase.master.HMaster - Unhandled exception. Starting shutdown.

I think that's because I had a hard crash in the cluster a while ago - and the following WARN since then
2012-01-25 21:20:47,121 WARN namenode,60000,1327513078123-CatalogJanitor org.apache.hadoop.hbase.master.CatalogJanitor - REGIONINFO_QUALIFIER is empty in keyvalues={emails,,xxx./info:server/1314336400471/Put/vlen=38, emails,,1314189353300.xxx./info:serverstartcode/1314336400471/Put/vlen=8}
my patch was simple to go around the NPE (as the other code around the lines)
but I don't know if that's correct
