Summary:
master log recovery hole, master can crash and trash the logs
Description:
During recovery, the master had opened all the logfiles, but when it went to open the destination files, it crashed. The logfile is missing, the edits did not get applied.
looks like there is a hole whereby we delete the original logfiles before we confirm the new output logs were written. oops!
