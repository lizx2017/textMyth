Summary:
Enhance test suite to be able to specify distributed scenarios
Description:
We keep finding good cases that are reasonably hard to test, yet the test suite does not encode these.
For example:
HBASE-2413 Master does not respect generation stamps, may result in meta getting permanently offlined
HBASE-2312 Possible data loss when RS goes into GC pause while rolling HLog
I am sure there are many more such "scenarios" we should put into the unit tests.
