Summary:
Spelling mistake in error message in HMasterCommandLine
Description:
If hadoop-zookeeper-server is installed and started, starting hbase-master in standalone mode will display this error message which has some typos.
$ sudo /etc/init.d/hadoop-hbase-master start
Starting Hadoop HBase master daemon: starting master, logging to /usr/lib/hbase/logs/hbase-hbase-master/cloudera-vm.out
Couldnt start ZK at requested address of 2181, instead got: 2182. Aborting. Why? Because clients (eg shell) wont be able to find this ZK quorum
hbase-master.
