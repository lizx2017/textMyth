Summary:
Fix the way hostnames and IPs are handled
Description:
From the list by Yabo-Arber Xu,
Yes, I've unlocked the port, and i am actually able to access from the web
UI with a client not running on EC2 to HBase at example.com:60010. It shows
all User Tables, but the Region Servers Address is the EC2 internal address:
domU-12-31-39-00-65-E5.compute-1.internal:60020.
I guess the client fails because it can not connect region server, which
serves only for an internal IP. However, in hbase-site.xml, I did configure
with region server explicitly in its external IP.
<property>
<name>hbase.regionserver</name>
<value>ec2-67-202-57-127.compute-1.amazonaws.com:60020</value>
<description>The host and port a HBase region server runs at.
</description>
</property>
In fact we completely bypass the hostname set in hbase.regionserver, also the hostnames in the web UI are not the good ones. We should do that part like hadoop does.
