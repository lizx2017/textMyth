Summary:
[replication] ReplicationSource won't close if failing to contact the sink
Description:
When trying to close a source, it will hang if it's already in shipEdits() and has issues reaching the sink. The reason is that in that method the while loop only checks if the RS is going down but not if the source was asked to shutdown.
