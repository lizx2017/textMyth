Summary:
[hbase] fixes for build up on hudson
Description:
Fixes for hbase breakage up on hudson. There seem to be many reasons for the failings.
One is that the .META. region of a sudden decides its 'no good' and it gets deployed elsewhere. Tests don't have the tolerance for this kinda churn. A previous commit adding in logging of why .META. is 'no good'. Hopefully that will help.
Found also a case where TestTableMapReduce would fail because no sleep between retries when getting new scanners.
