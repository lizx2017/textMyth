Summary:
Two threads named pool-1-thread-1 and pool-2-thread-1 remains after the shutdown of a cluster
Description:
There are two issues with these threads:
there should have a better name. pool-x-thread-y is the default name given by java.util.concurrent.Executors
these threads should not survive to a minicluster shutdown
They are created by org.apache.hadoop.ipc.Server$Listener (with version 0.20.205.0; the code was different before), so the first issue is a hadoop common one. It's unclear for the second one, it could be hadoop-common as well.
Constructor for org.apache.hadoop.ipc.Server$Listener:
    public Listener() throws IOException {
      //...
      readPool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(readThreads);  // Lack a ThreadFactory to set the names
      //...
    }
Server#stop shutdowns the thread pool.
