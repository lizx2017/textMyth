Summary:
TestAcidGuarantees system test now flushes too aggressively
Description:
HBASE-6552 caused the TestAcidGuarantees system test to flush more aggressively, because flushes are where ACID problems have occurred in the past.
After some more cluster testing, it seems like this too aggressive; my clusters eventually can't keep up with the number of flushes/compactions and start getting SocketTimeoutExceptions. We could try to optimize the flushes/compactions, but since this workload would never occur in practice, I don't think it is worth the effort. Instead, let's just only flush once a minute. This is arbitrary, but seems to work.
Here is my comment in the (upcoming) patch:
// Flushing has been a source of ACID violations previously (see HBASE-2856), so ideally,
// we would flush as often as possible.  On a running cluster, this isn't practical:
// (1) we will cause a lot of load due to all the flushing and compacting
// (2) we cannot change the flushing/compacting related Configuration options to try to
// alleviate this
// (3) it is an unrealistic workload, since no one would actually flush that often.
// Therefore, let's flush every minute to have more flushes than usual, but not overload
// the running cluster.
