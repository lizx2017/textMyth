Summary:
OOME but we don't abort
Description:
On streamy cluster saw case where graceful shutdown had been triggered rather than an abort on OOME. On graceful shutdown, we wait on leases to expire or be closed. Server wouldn't go down because it was waiting on leases to expire only an OOME in Leases had killed the thread so it wasn't ever going to expire anything. Node was stuck for four hours till someone noticed it.
