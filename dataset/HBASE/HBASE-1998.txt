Summary:
Check that session timeout is actually being set; it doesn't seem to be
Description:
The just-previous issue is about relation of tick time to session timeout. We need to fix that. Independent, it would seem that session timeouts are after 30 seconds, not the 40 seconds we'd expect passing in a tick time of 2 seconds and a default sessino timout of 60 seconds. Check.
