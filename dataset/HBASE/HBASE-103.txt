Summary:
[hbase] TestDFSAbort failed in nightly #242
Description:
TestDFSAbort and TestBloomFilters failed in last nights nightly build (#242). This issue is about trying to figure whats up w/ TDFSA.
Studying console logs, HRegionServer stopped logging any activity and HMaster for its part did not expire the HRegionServer lease. On top of it all, continued tests of the state of HDFS – the test is meant to sure Hbase shutdown when HDFS is pulled from under it – seems to have continued reporting itself healthy though it'd be closed.
