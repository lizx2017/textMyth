Summary:
TestMergeTable failing in TRUNK
Description:
This is an old crufty test that is failing in TRUNK. We create regions – user, root, and meta regions offline – but then come along and disable them after starting up minicluster. Confuses new master. This test also does not emit logging up in hudson because its written against old-style testing... even has a subclass of the HBaseTestCase to do this crazy manual creation.
