Summary:
TableOutputCommitter should implement recovery if we don't want jobs to start from 0 on RM restart
Description:
HBase extends OutputCommitter which turns recovery off. Meaning all completed maps are lost on RM restart and job starts from scratch. FileOutputCommitter implements recovery so we should look at that to see what is potentially needed for recovery.
