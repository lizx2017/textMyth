Summary:
Fix build break - ec2
Description:
Because all contrib/** reuses build-contrib.xml -, internally they reuse ivy-retrieve.xml and hence need the presence of an ivy.xml in ec2 directory to succeed.
Temporary patch with no dependencies in . Ideal patch should be to refactor build*.xml as appropriate.
