Summary:
Regions stuck in transition after rolling restart, perpetual timeout handling but nothing happens
Description:
The rolling restart script is great for bringing on the weird stuff. On my little loaded cluster if I run it, it horks the cluster and it doesn't recover. I notice two issues that need fixing:
1. We'll miss noticing that a server was carrying .META. and it never gets assigned â€“ the shutdown handlers get stuck in perpetual wait on a .META. assign that will never happen.
2. Perpetual cycling of the this sequence per region not succesfully assigned:

Timeout period again elapses an then same sequence.
This is what I've been working on.
