Summary:
Split log worker should terminate properly when waiting for znode
Description:
This is an attempt to fix the fact that SplitLogWorker threads are not being terminated properly in some unit tests. This probably does not happen in production because the master always creates the log-splitting ZK node, but it does happen in 89-fb. Thanks to Prakash Khemani for help on this.
