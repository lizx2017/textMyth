Summary:
HBase handling of host names is case sensitive
Description:
Our HBase cluster showed weird multiple assigments of all regions.
Master logs showed that every minute region assignments were all determined invalid and regions were being re-assigned.
The reason for the assignements to be found invalid is that they were done on hosts whose name in /etc/hosts was in lowercase but whose name in the DNS was in uppercase.
In BaseScanner.java:572, the HServerInfo is retrieved using the servername as key. As the name comes from the DNS, it was all uppercase and thus no HServerInfo could be found.
The DNS cache needs to have its keys converted to lowercase to avoid this (HServerInfo.java:245).
This is a major problem because simple changes to the DNS infrastructure can cause major data corruption in HBase.
