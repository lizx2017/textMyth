Summary:
"hbase master stop" does not bring down backup masters
Description:
Typing "hbase master stop" produces the following message:
"stop Start cluster shutdown; Master signals RegionServer shutdown"
It seems like backup masters should be considered part of the cluster, but they are not brought down by "hbase master stop".
"stop-hbase.sh" does correctly bring down the backup masters.
The same behavior is observed when a client app makes use of the client API HBaseAdmin.shutdown() http://hbase.apache.org/apidocs/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/client/HBaseAdmin.html#shutdown() â€“ this isn't too surprising since I think "hbase master stop" just calls this API.
It seems like HBASE-1448 address this; perhaps there was a regression?
