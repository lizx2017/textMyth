Summary:
Test up on hudson are leaking zookeeper ensembles
Description:
Here is from a recent run up on Hudson:
2010-10-14 23:31:56,482 INFO  [main] zookeeper.MiniZooKeeperCluster(111): Failed binding ZK Server to client port: 21818
2010-10-14 23:31:56,483 INFO  [main] zookeeper.MiniZooKeeperCluster(111): Failed binding ZK Server to client port: 21819
2010-10-14 23:31:56,483 INFO  [main] zookeeper.MiniZooKeeperCluster(111): Failed binding ZK Server to client port: 21820
2010-10-14 23:31:56,522 INFO  [main] zookeeper.MiniZooKeeperCluster(125): Started MiniZK Server on client port: 21821
See how we start trying to bind to 21818 but we don't get a free port till we get to 21821?
Some test or tests is not cleaning up after itself leaving a running zk cluster or two about.
TestReplication looks to be suspect. Here is its @AfterClass method:
  /**
   * @throws java.lang.Exception
   */
  @AfterClass
  public static void tearDownAfterClass() throws Exception {
    /* REENABLE
    utility2.shutdownMiniCluster();
    utility1.shutdownMiniCluster();
    */
  }
