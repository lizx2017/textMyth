Summary:
Mismatch with config param name in xml and code
Description:
In hbase-default.xml there listed one param "io.storefile.bloom.cacheonwrite"
<property>
  <name>io.storefile.bloom.cacheonwrite</name>
  <value>false</value>
  <description>
   Enables cache-on-write for inline blocks of a compound Bloom filter.
  </description>
</property>
No place in the code this config is getting used.
Instead in CacheConfig there is a config param name
/**
   * Configuration key to cache compound bloom filter blocks on write.
   */
  public static final String CACHE_BLOOM_BLOCKS_ON_WRITE_KEY =
      "hfile.block.bloom.cacheonwrite";
Seems issue with entry in the xml file.
We can correct the xml with the config name as hfile.block.bloom.cacheonwrite ?
