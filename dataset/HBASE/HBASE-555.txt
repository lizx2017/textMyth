Summary:
Only one Worker in HRS; on startup, if assigned tens of regions, havoc of reassignments because open processing is done in series
Description:
On the Lars clusters, he's up into the thousands of regions. Starting this cluster, there is a load of churn in the master log as we assign regions, they report their opening and then after the hbase.hbasemaster.maxregionopen of one minute elapses, we assign the region elsewhere.
Problem seems to be the fact that we only run a single Worker thread in our regionserver; means that region opens are processed in series.
For example, the below shows when a master assigned a region and then the regionserver side log when it got around to opening it:
2008-03-29 04:48:51,638 INFO org.apache.hadoop.hbase.HMaster: assigning region pdc-docs,US20060158177_20060720,1205765009844 to server 192.168.105.19:60020
..
2008-03-29 04:50:58,124 INFO org.apache.hadoop.hbase.HRegionServer: MSG_REGION_OPEN : pdc-docs,US20060158177_20060720,1205765009844
There is > 2 minutes between the two loggings (I checked clocks on this cluster and they are synced).
Looking in the regionserver log, its just filled with logging on the opening of regions. The region opens are running pretty fast at about a second each but there are hundreds of regions to open in this case so its easy to go over our default of 60 seconds.
