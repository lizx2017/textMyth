Summary:
Issues with UI for table compact/split operation completion. After split/compaction operation using UI, the page is not automatically redirecting back using IE8/Firefox.
Description:
Steps:
1. create table with regions.
2. insert some amount of data in such a way that make some Hfiles which is lessthan min.compacted files size (say 3 hfiles are there but min compaction files 10)
3. from ui perform compact operation on the table.
"TABLE ACTION REQUEST Accepted" page is displayed
4. operation is failing becoz compaction criteria is not meeting. but from ui compaction requests are continously sending to server. This happens using IE(history.back() seems to resend compact/split request). Firefox seems Ok in this case.
5. Later no automatic redirection to main hamster page occurs.
SOLUTION:
table.jsp in hbase master.
The meta tag for HTML contains refresh with javascript:history.back().
A javascript cannot execute in the meta refresh tag like above in table.jsp and snapshot.jsp
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="5,javascript:history.back()" />
This will FAIL.
W3 school also suggests to use refresh in JAVAscript rather than meta tag.
If above meta is replaced as below, the behavior is OK verified for IE8/Firefox.
<script type="text/javascript">
<!--
setTimeout("history.back()",5000);
-->
</script>
Hence in table.jsp and snapshot.jsp, it should be modified as above.
