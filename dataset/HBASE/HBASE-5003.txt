Summary:
If the master is started with a wrong root dir, it gets stuck and can't be killed
Description:
Reported by a new user on IRC who tried to set hbase.rootdir to file:///~/hbase, the master gets stuck and cannot be killed. I tried something similar on my machine and it spins while logging:
2011-12-09 16:11:17,002 WARN org.apache.hadoop.hbase.util.FSUtils: Unable to create version file at file:/bin/hbase, retrying: Mkdirs failed to create file:/bin/hbase
2011-12-09 16:11:27,002 WARN org.apache.hadoop.hbase.util.FSUtils: Unable to create version file at file:/bin/hbase, retrying: Mkdirs failed to create file:/bin/hbase
2011-12-09 16:11:37,003 WARN org.apache.hadoop.hbase.util.FSUtils: Unable to create version file at file:/bin/hbase, retrying: Mkdirs failed to create file:/bin/hbase
The reason it cannot be stopped is that the master's main thread is stuck in there and will never be notified:
"Master:0;su-jdcryans-01.local,51116,1323475535684" prio=5 tid=7f92b7a3c000 nid=0x1137ba000 waiting on condition [1137b9000]

It seems we should do a better handling of the exceptions we get in there, and die if we need to. It would make a better user experience.
Maybe also do a check on hbase.rootdir before even starting the master.
