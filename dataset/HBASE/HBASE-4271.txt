Summary:
Clean up coprocessor's handlings of table operations
Description:
Couple fixes we can do w.r.t coprocessor's handlings of table operations.
1. Honor MasterObserver's requests to bypass default action.
2. Fix up the function signatures for preCreateTable to use HRegionInfo as parameter instead.
3. Invoke postEnableTable, etc. methods after the operations are done.
