Summary:
book is inconsistent regarding disabling - major compaction
Description:
It seems that the book has some inconsistencies regarding the way to disable major compactions
According to the book in chapter 2.6.1.1. HBase Default Configuration
hbase.hregion.majorcompaction - The time (in miliseconds) between 'major' compactions of all HStoreFiles in a region. Default: 1 day. Set to 0 to disable automated major compactions.
Default: 86400000 (http://hbase.apache.org/book.html#hbase_default_configurations)
According to the book at chapter 2.8.2.8. Managed Compactions
"A common administrative technique is to manage major compactions manually, rather than letting HBase do it. By default, HConstants.MAJOR_COMPACTION_PERIOD is one day and major compactions may kick in when you least desire it - especially on a busy system. To "turn off" automatic major compactions set the value to Long.MAX_VALUE."
According to the code org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.Store.java, "0" is the right answer.
