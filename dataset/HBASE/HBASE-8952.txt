Summary:
Missing error handling can cause RegionServer RPC thread to busy loop forever
Description:
If the connection to the client is closed unexpectedly and "at the wrong time", the code will attempt to keep reading from the socket in a busy loop.
This bug seems to be present in all released versions of HBase, including the tip of the 0.94 and 0.95 branches, however I only ran into it while porting AsyncHBase to 0.95
