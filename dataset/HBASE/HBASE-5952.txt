Summary:
Sync hardcoded default flush size and max file size with hbase-default.xml
Description:
Since the hardcoded default flush size is 64MB, but the default in hbase-default.xml is 128MB, if the client does set it to 64MB,
the actual flush size will be 128MB instead, due to the way HRegion get the flush size. We can change how HRegion get the flush size,
but it is clean and simple to sync up the defaults.
