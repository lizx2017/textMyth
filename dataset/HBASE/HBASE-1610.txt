Summary:
On regionserver reinit on zk expiration, spews thousands of "Unable to set watcher on ZooKeeper master address. Retrying." in a few seconds
Description:
It looks like whats going on is that the close flag has been set so the sleeper.sleep in below is not having an effect â€“ but looking in code, I see the close flag unset as part of initialization so I'm not sure whats up.
private void watchMasterAddress() {
while (!stopRequested.get() && !zooKeeperWrapper.watchMasterAddress(this))
{ LOG.warn("Unable to set watcher on ZooKeeper master address. Retrying."); sleeper.sleep(); }
}
