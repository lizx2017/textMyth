Summary:
Fix heap size reporting in HRegion
Description:
The size reported by Fixed_Overhead variable in HRegion misses out on a boolean variable. TestHeapSize doesn't report it because of the alignment we do to make it multiple of 8.
The equation for HRegion heap usage from Fixed_Overhead is:
Fixed_Overhead = align(100 + 42*ref + 1 arr) = align(284) = 288 on a 32 bit vm
(On a 32 bit vm, 1 ref = 4bytes, 1 arr = 16 bytes)
The equation formed using reflection (in Classsize) is:
Expected_Overehead = align(101 + 42*ref + 1arr) = align(285) = 288.
So, the testHeapSize doesn't fail currently.
But if I add a reference (did in last patch in 8741), it starts failing because, now the equations are:
Fixed_Overhead = align(100 + 43*ref + 1 arr) = align(288) = 288
Expected_Overhead = align(101 + 43*ref + 1 arr) = align(289) = 296.
