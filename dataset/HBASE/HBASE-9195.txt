Summary:
Fix TestFSHDFSUtils against java7 test re-ordering
Description:
The test methods of TestFSHDFSUtils depends on hbase.lease.recovery.dfs.timeout, which is overwritten by testIsFileClosed. In case it runs first, it fails testRecoverLease because it assumes a different value. This makes this test flakey in java7 environment.
The proposed fix is to let both tests specify the property value in their definition.
