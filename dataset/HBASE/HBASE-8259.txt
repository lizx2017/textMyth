Summary:
Snapshot backport in 0.94.6 breaks rolling restarts
Description:
Aleksandr Shulman found with his nifty QA tools that 0.94.6 has an incompatible change due to HBASE-7360 (Snapshot 0.94 Backport) that breaks rolling restarts.
RegionTransitionData.write() uses eventType.ordinal() that is the index in the enum and not the value specified in the enum definition. It means we can't add new states in the middle of the list. This can be fixed by moving C_M_SNAPSHOT_TABLE and C_M_RESTORE_SNAPSHOT at the end of the list. Trunk does the right thing already.
Right now, RIT znodes created with 0.94.6 (or top of the branch) will use the wrong value for the event type. You will see things like:

We should roll a 0.94.6.1 or 0.94.7 as soon this is fixed IMO.
