Summary:
Xmx setting in pom to use for tests/surefire does not appear to work
Description:
I was running intense version of TestRollingRestart and changing the Xmx setting in our pom file wasn't changing anything.
What we have now is:
            <argLine>-enableassertions</argLine>
            <argLine>-Xmx1400m</argLine>
But on process listing (and through experimentation with my tests), only -enableassertions is used.
However, changing to below and it worked:
            <argLine>-enableassertions -Xmx1400m</argLine>
Just wanted to open a jira and see if i'm missing something from someone with more maven experience.
