Summary:
Deadlock when RS tries to RPC to itself inside SplitTransaction
Description:
In testing the 0.89.20100830 rc, I ran into a deadlock with the following situation:
All of the IPC Handler threads are blocked on the region lock, which is held by CompactSplitThread.
CompactSplitThread is in the process of trying to edit META to create the offline parent. META happens to be on the same server as is executing the split.
Therefore, the CompactSplitThread is trying to connect back to itself, but all of the handler threads are blocked, so the IPC never happens. Thus, the entire RS gets deadlocked.
