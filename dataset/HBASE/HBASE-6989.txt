Summary:
Avoid unneceseary regular expression matching in ruby code for "list" command
Description:
HBaseAdmin already has an API which can accept a regular expression string and return the matching tables.
The list command in HBase shell should make use of this and should not pull the entire table list and do a matching of its own
