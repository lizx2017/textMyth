Summary:
Remove dead server location cache from log replay connection
Description:
Removing dead server location cache from log replay connection. This is a nice
to have change because the connection for log replay is exclusive for
replay so there should be no cache from the dead server. The change is a prevention strategy in case future changes break the assumption.
