Summary:
TestZooKeeperNodeTracker sometimes fails due to a race condition in test notification
Description:
TestZooKeeperNodeTracker sometimes fails with errors like the following:
Tests run: 2, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 0.738 sec <<< FAILURE!
testNodeTracker(org.apache.hadoop.hbase.zookeeper.TestZooKeeperNodeTracker)  Time elapsed: 0.17 sec  <<< FAILURE!
java.lang.AssertionError: 
        at org.junit.Assert.fail(Assert.java:91)
        at org.junit.Assert.assertTrue(Assert.java:43)
        at org.junit.Assert.assertTrue(Assert.java:54)
        at org.apache.hadoop.hbase.zookeeper.TestZooKeeperNodeTracker.testNodeTracker(TestZooKeeperNodeTracker.java:203)
        at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)
Running the test locally this can happen as much as 25-50% of the time.
It looks like this is due to a basic race condition in the way the test is structured. The test code uses:
    // Wait for zk event to be processed
    zkListener.waitForDataChange();
But, since zkListener is instantiated (and registered with ZooKeeperWatcher) prior to secondTracker (which is always the source of the failure), zkListener will be notified first of the change and there is a race condition between the subsequent test assertions and the secondTracker notification.
Attaching a patch with a simple fix of just instantiating secondTracker prior to zkListener so that it's registered (and notified) first.
