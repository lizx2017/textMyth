Summary:
Surefire steals focus on mac osx
Description:
When I run builds on mac osx, the focus is stolen as we go through tests; surefire is launching a little app named variously: "forkedbooter" is one, "mapred.Child" another. The little app goes away when the test is done but meantime it robs the focus making desktop unusable.
