Bring back transactions and indexing for 0.20
Description:
Bring back transactions and indexing for 0.20. Stack suggests moving into contrib, which I'm fine with. Currently, the only sticking point I see is that we have already polluted HTableDescriptor with a list of indexSpecifications, so moving it out will require migration..
