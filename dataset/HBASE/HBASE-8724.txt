Summary:
[0.94] ExportSnapshot should not use hbase.tmp.dir as a staging dir on hdfs
Description:
On 0.94, ExportSnapshot uses "hbase.tmp.dir" as the job's staging directory on hdfs. However, "hbase.tmp.dir" is by definition a local directory, thus should not be used as an hdfs directory for the job.
Trunk uses JobUtil.getStagingDir() which gets the staging dir from JobSubmissionFiles class in Hadoop, so trunk is fine.
We've discovered this since it fails the test on windows, but this is not windows-specific as per above (like specifying hbase.tmp.dir as /var/hbase/tmp/ etc)
