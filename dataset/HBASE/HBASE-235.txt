Summary:
Master and RegionServer web UIs show nonexistent regions after a DROP TABLE
Description:
I dropped a table with 121 regions, ans read from the web UI. Afterwards, most of the regions went away, but 6 remained counted and listed in the web UI. select * from .META. shows no rows, so in reality the regions are gone. This inconsistency gives a poor sense of the consistency of HBase.
