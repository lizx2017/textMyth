Summary:
heap usage and limit reporting doesn't work as expected when using G1 GC
Description:
Getting some early experience with the G1 GC.
Running with -Xmx1000m and HBASE_OPTS set to "-XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOpts -XX:+UseG1GC". Regionserver heap use reports are not of much use:
hbase(main):001:0> status 'simple'

        requests=0, regions=1, usedHeap=0, maxHeap=41

top is about right:

Incidentally, don't try -XX:+UseG1GC and -XX:+DoEscapeAnalysis together or the JVM will rapidly segfault.
