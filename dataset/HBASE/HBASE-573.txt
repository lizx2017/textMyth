Summary:
HBase does not read hadoop-*.xml for dfs configuration after moving out hadoop/contrib
Description:
When HBase was in hadoop/contrib, the hbase script set both HADOOP_CONF_DIR
and HBASE_CONF_DIR to CLASSPATH, so that dfs's configuration can be loaded
correctly. However, when moved out hadoop/contrib, it only sets HBASE_CONF_DIR.
I can think of several possible solutions:
1) set HADOOP_CONF_DIR in hbase-env.sh, then add HADOOP_CONF_DIR to CLASSPATH as before
2) Instruct user to create links for hadoop-*.xml if they want to customize some dfs settings.
3) If only a small set of dfs confs are related to dfs's client, maybe they can be set via hbase-site.xml, then hbase sets these for us when create a FileSystem obj.
Please see the thread "# of dfs replications when using hbase" on hbase-user@.
