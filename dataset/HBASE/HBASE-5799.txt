Summary:
[89-fb] Multiget API may return incomplete resutls
Description:
There is a serious bug in the multiget which will cause the multiget function only returns part of the results.
In the process function:
The initial region is set before sorting the input list.
So after the input list has been sorted, the initial region may no longer be the correct region for the first row in the sorted list.
So the first row in the sorted list may be sent to the wrong region server which has no result for this row.
