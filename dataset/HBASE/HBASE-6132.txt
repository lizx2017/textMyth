Summary:
ColumnCountGetFilter & PageFilter not working with FilterList
Description:
Thanks to Anoop and Ramkrishna, here's what we found with FilterList
If I use FilterList to include ColumnCountGetFilter among other filters, the returning Result has no keyvalues.
This problem seems to occur when specified column count is less then actual number of existing columns.
Also same problem arises with PageFilter
Following is the code of the problem:
Configuration conf = HBaseConfiguration.create();
HTable table = new HTable(conf, "test");
Get get = new Get(Bytes.toBytes("test00001"));
FilterList filterList = new FilterList();
filterList.addFilter(new ColumnCountGetFilter(100));           
get.setFilter(filterList);
Result r = table.get(get);
System.out.println(r.size()); // prints zero
