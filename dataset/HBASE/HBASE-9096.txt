Summary:
Disable split during log replay
Description:
When regions are allowed to take writes during recovery, we could end up in a situation where a split of a region might be triggered. That would close the old region leading to failure of the ongoing replay. In discussions with Jeffrey Zhong, it seemed to make sense to just disable split during recovery.
