Summary:
HBaseServer logs the full query.
Description:
We log the query when we have an error. As a results, the logs are not readable when using stuff like multi.
As a side note, this is as well a security issue (no need to encrypt the network and the storage if the logs contain everything). I'm not removing the full log line here; but just ask and I do it .
