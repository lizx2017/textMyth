Summary:
[replication] When transferring queues, check if the peer still exists before copying the znodes
Description:
Right now it's a pain if you remove a peer and still have rogue queues because they get moved on and on and on. NodeFailoverWorker needs to run the check:
if (!zkHelper.getPeerClusters().containsKey(src.getPeerClusterId())) {
before this:
SortedMap<String, SortedSet<String>> newQueues = zkHelper.copyQueuesFromRS(rsZnode);
And test.
