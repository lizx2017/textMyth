Summary:
Fixups to MultithreadedTableMapper for Hadoop 0.23.2+
Description:
There are two issues:
StatusReporter has a new method getProgress()
Mapper and reducer context objects can no longer be directly instantiated.
See attached patch. I'm not thrilled with the added reflection but it was the minimally intrusive change.
Raised the priority to critical because compilation fails.
