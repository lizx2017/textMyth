Summary:
Tweak retry settings some more, *some more*
Description:
Follow on from hbase-8776.
Need to fix retries and timeouts. We cut them down so much hbase-it tests fail.
From https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-8776?focusedCommentId=13698762&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13698762 @nkeywal says:
I would like to change
hbase.client.retries.number -> 30 (instead of 14 or 20 today)
hbase.client.pause -> 500 (instead of 100 or 1000 today).
Context: see HBASE-6295.
As well, would it make sense to remove all the hbase-site.xml and hbase-defaults.xml to rely only on the defaults in the code. This would trigger another set of issues, as sometimes the defaults are duplicated and different. But these are bugs as well. Imho, this duplication is confusing and it leads to unreliable behavior as we don't really know what are the setting actually used.
Regards removing hbase-site.xml from everywhere to rely on defaults in code, over in hbase-8776 I tried removing them and way too many tests failed. Looks like it'd be tough removing them.
