Summary:
Proper html escaping for region names
Description:
I noticed that we are not doing html escaping for the rs/master web interfaces, so you can end up generating html like:
<tr>
  <td>ci,,\xEEp/<T\xBE\xC0,1336471826990.fc5a943e75ce8521b1ccdaf72d2c96c8.</td>
  
  <td>
    <a href="hostname">hostname</a>
  </td>
  
  <td>,\xEEp/<T\xBE\xC0</td>
  <td>-n\xA8\xE0\x15\xDD\x80!</td>
  <td>2966724</td>
</tr>
This obviously does not render properly.
Also, my crazy theory is that it can be a security risk. Since the region name is computed from table rows, which are most of the time user input. Thus if the rows contain a "<script onload=" or similar, then that will be executed on the developer's browser having possibly access to dev environment.
