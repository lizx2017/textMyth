Summary:
[performance] Cache family maxversions; we were calculating on each access
Description:
Profiling I see we are calculating max versions each time:
      String value = getValue(HConstants.VERSIONS);
      this.cachedMaxVersions = (value != null)?
        Integer.valueOf(value).intValue(): DEFAULT_VERSIONS;
Caching it should improve things. Seeing that its 10% of memory when writing and about 10% of CPU. Reading its 10% of CPU according to profiler.
