Summary:
Limit number of attempts to assign a region
Description:
In sending a region open request to a region server, we make sure we try at most some configured times. However, once the request is accepted by the region server, the region could go through this transition forever: failed_open (in ZK) => closed => opening => failed_open (in ZK), assuming no RPC/network issue.
It will be good to break the loop and limit the number of tries and move the region to failed_open state (will be introduced in HBASE-8137)
