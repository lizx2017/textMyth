Summary:
mvn clean compile on trunk and 0.95 does not produce target/cached_classpath.txt
Description:
The usual workflow of mvn clean compile followed by ./bin/hbase foo no longer works. It looks like it was broken by HBASE-7637, switching the phase in hbase-it/pom.xml from compile to test. Before I propose the obvious patch, a couple questions:
Nicolas Liochon: why is this done in hbase-it instead of anywhere else, such as the top-level pom?
Elliott Clark: why does this execution in the compile phase break hadoop-2 profile while running it in test does not?
