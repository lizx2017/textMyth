Summary:
[hbase] Simple switch to enable DEBUG level-logging in hbase
Description:
Currently, enabling debug logging is a matter of enabling in log4j per class or by setting HADOOP_ROOT_LOGGER up in hadoop scripts. Need a simple means of throwing the DEBUG level switch for hbase-only logging, something that is easy to convey to users (One thing to look at would be adding to the UI a switch to enable DEBUG-level logging in hbase).
