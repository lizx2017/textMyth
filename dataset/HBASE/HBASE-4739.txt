Summary:
Master dying while going to close a region can leave it in transition forever
Description:
I saw this in the aftermath of HBASE-4729 on a 0.92 refreshed yesterday, when the master died it had just created the RIT znode for a region but didn't tell the RS to close it yet.
When the master restarted it saw the znode and started printing this:
2011-11-03 00:02:49,130 INFO org.apache.hadoop.hbase.master.AssignmentManager: Regions in transition timed out: TestTable,0007560564,1320253568406.f76899564cabe7e9857c3aeb526ec9dc. state=CLOSING, ts=1320253605285, server=sv4r11s38,62003,1320195046948
2011-11-03 00:02:49,130 INFO org.apache.hadoop.hbase.master.AssignmentManager: Region has been CLOSING for too long, this should eventually complete or the server will expire, doing nothing
It's never going to happen, and it's blocking balancing.
I'm marking this as minor since I believe this situation is pretty rare unless you hit other bugs while trying out stuff to root bugs out.
