Summary:
Metrics refresh-task is not canceled when regions are closed, leaking HRegion objects
Description:
While investigating HBASE-7205 by repeatedly enabling and disabling one table having 100 regions I noticed that closed HRegion objects are kept forever in memory.
The memory analyzer tool indicates a reference to HRegion object in metrics refresh-task (MetricsRegionWrapperImpl.HRegionMetricsWrapperRunnable) that prevents the HRegion object to be collected.
