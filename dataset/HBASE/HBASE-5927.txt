Summary:
SSH and DisableTableHandler happening together does not clear the znode of the region and RIT map.
Description:
A possible exception: If the related regionserver was just killed(But HMaster has not perceived that), then we will get a local exception "Connection reset by peer". If this region belongs to a disabling table. what will happen?
ServerShutdownHandler will remove this region from AM#regions. So this region is still existing in RIT. TimeoutMonitor will take care of it after it got timeout. Then invoke unassign again. Since this region has been removed from AM#regions, it will return directly due to the below code:
    synchronized (this.regions) {
      // Check if this region is currently assigned
      if (!regions.containsKey(region)) {
        LOG.debug("Attempted to unassign region " +
          region.getRegionNameAsString() + " but it is not " +
          "currently assigned anywhere");
        return;
      }
    }
Then it leads to an end-less loop.
