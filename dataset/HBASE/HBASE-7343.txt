Summary:
Fix flaky condition for TestDrainingServer
Description:
The assert statement in setUpBeforeClass() may fail in case the region distribution is not even (a particular rs has 0 regions).
junit.framework.AssertionFailedError
 at junit.framework.Assert.fail(Assert.java:48)

 at org.apache.hadoop.hbase.TestDrainingServer.setUpBeforeClass(TestDrainingServer.java:83)
This is already fixed in trunk with HBASE-5992, but as that's a bigger change and uses 5877, this jira fixes that issue instead of backporting 5992.
