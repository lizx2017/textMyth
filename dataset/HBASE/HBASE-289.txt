Summary:
[hbase] Add a LocalHBaseCluster
Description:
Make a MiniHBaseCluster-like class named LocalHBaseCluster. Key difference would be purge of MiniDFSCluster and FileSystem references/management and removal of utility that only makes sense in a unit testing context (Perhaps have MHBC inherit from LHBC). Make a new class rather than move MHBC from src/test to src/java to allow for later having master and regionserver do direct method invocation rather than invocation via RPC. LHRC would be used when hbase.master is set to the value 'local'.
LHRC would have a shutdown method to shutdown the cluster. MHBC brings up the cluster on construction. Perhaps LHRC should do different and not start the cluster until invocation of startup method.
