Description:
Failed here https://builds.apache.org/job/hbase-0.95/323/testReport/org.apache.hadoop.hbase.security.access/TestAccessController/testGlobalAuthorizationForNewRegisteredRS/
Looks like it is not waiting long enough for single region to come online. At a minimum wait longer so can see more why it is NOT coming on line.
