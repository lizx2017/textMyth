Summary:
Failure in assigning root causes system hang
Description:
In looking into a TestReplication failure, I found out sometimes assignRoot could fail, for example, RS is not serving traffic yet. In this case, the master will keep waiting for root to be available, which could never happen.
Need to gracefully terminate master if root is not assigned properly.
