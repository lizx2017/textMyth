Summary:
HBaseObjectWritable should support arrays of any Writable or Serializable, not just Writable[].
Description:
Presently, an exception is actually thrown when deserializing the output of HBaseObjectWritable.writeObject(SomeSubclassOfWritable[]).
The issue is pretty difficult to debug.
This patch adds support for arrays whose contents are subtypes of both Serializable and Writable.
