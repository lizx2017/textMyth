Summary:
RetriesExhaustedException: Trying to contact region server
Description:
I have a hbase table which holds data for more than 10GB. Now I used the same client scanner to scan which fails and reports,
"Could not seek StoreFileScanner[HFileScanner for reader reader=hdfs".
This issue occurs only for the table which holds huge data and not for tables holding small data.
