Summary:
META region stuck in RS2ZK_REGION_OPENED state
Description:
In cluster testing trunk, I ended up with a situation where META was unassigned and no amount of restarting various pieces would fix it. On master startup, I see:
2010-06-20 21:08:05,431 DEBUG org.apache.hadoop.hbase.master.BaseScanner: Current assignment of .META.,,1.1028785192 is not valid; serverAddress=, startCode=0 unknown.
2010-06-20 21:08:05,436 DEBUG org.apache.hadoop.hbase.zookeeper.ZooKeeperWrapper: While creating UNASSIGNED region 1028785192 exists, state = RS2ZK_REGION_OPENED
2010-06-20 21:08:05,438 WARN org.apache.hadoop.hbase.zookeeper.ZooKeeperWrapper: <monster01.sf.cloudera.com:/hbase,org.apache.hadoop.hbase.master.HMaster>Failed to create ZNode /hbase/UNASSIGNED/1028785192 in ZooKeeper

then on the RS:
2010-06-20 21:08:05,899 ERROR org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.RSZookeeperUpdater: ZNode /hbase/UNASSIGNED/1028785192 is not in CLOSED/OFFLINE state (state = RS2ZK_REGION_OPENED), will NOT open region.

and the region never opens
