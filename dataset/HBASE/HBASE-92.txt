Summary:
[hbaseshell] output should default utf8 encoding
Description:
Outputting the content of an hbase cell, hbaseshell makes a String of the hbase cell bytes. Usually making the String, hbaseshell stipulates the bytes are UTF-8 – which is a pretty good bet, if the cell contains a String – but then it goes and uses the JVM's System.out writing STDOUT. This latter will have been built using the JVM's locale. This will usually not be UTF-8.
