Summary:
Most of the regions were added into AssignmentManager#servers twice
Description:
Here's the scenario of how did the problem happened:
1. When HMaster start, all regionservers checkin ok, and count of regions out on cluster is 10083, which is the actual region number count.
2. Then OpenedRegionHandler#process received zookeeper's events, and added 9923 regions to the hris list.
but the 9923 regions already exists, force added.
3. The LoadBalancer get the wrong Region numbers of 20006 (10083 + 9923).
AssignmentManager#addToServers method:
private void addToServers(final HServerInfo hsi, final HRegionInfo hri) {
List<HRegionInfo> hris = servers.get(hsi);
if (hris == null)
{ hris = new ArrayList<HRegionInfo>(); servers.put(hsi, hris); }
hris.add(hri); // Same region was double added here
}
