Summary:
RegionMovedException is handled incorrectly for multi-region requests that fail completely
Description:
RegionMovedException is currently thrown on global level, and due to how ProtobufUtil does things, it fails the entire multi-request, see HBASE-8036. RME also doesn't specify the region.
Thus, if it's thrown for one region and there are multiple regions in the request, HCM applies it to all of them, which causes clients to become confused temporarily. We should either fix HBASE-8036 or add region encoded name in the description.
