Summary:
Secure HBase builds fail
Description:
I saw the following in HBase-0.92-security build #39:
[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-compiler-plugin:2.0.2:testCompile (default-testCompile) on project hbase: Compilation failure
[ERROR] <https://builds.apache.org/job/HBase-0.92-security/ws/trunk/src/test/java/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/regionserver/TestStore.java>:[590,4] method does not override or implement a method from a supertype
[ERROR] -> [Help 1]
org.apache.maven.lifecycle.LifecycleExecutionException: Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-compiler-plugin:2.0.2:testCompile (default-testCompile) on project hbase: Compilation failure

The above was probably introduced by HBASE-5006
