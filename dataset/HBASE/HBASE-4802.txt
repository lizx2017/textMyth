Summary:
Disable show table metrics in bulk loader
Description:
During bulk load, the Configuration object may be set to null. This caused an NPE in per-CF metrics because it consults the Configuration to determine whether to show the Table name. Need to add simple change to allow the conf to be null & not specify table name in that instance.
