Summary:
hbase-client does not depend on map reduce, but the pom.xml includes it
Description:
mvn dependency:analyze is strange on this one. You can remove or add the dependency, it won't complain about "used but undeclared" or "undeclared but used" dependencies. But it does a difference in dependency:tree or for the client application.
