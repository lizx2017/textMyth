Summary:
sync bulk and regular assigment handling socket timeout exception
Description:
In regular assignment, in case of socket network timeout, it tries to call openRegion again and again without change the region plan, ZK offline node,
till the region is out of transition, in case the region server is still up.
We may need to sync them up and make sure bulk assignment does the same in this case.
