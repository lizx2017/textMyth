Summary:
AsyncProcess and HTable will submit the same mutation twice if there is an error locating region.
Description:
HTable#backgroundFlushCommits calls AsyncProcess#submit
AsyncProcess#submit tries to get the region location but doesn't remove the mutation from the write buffer. If it doesn't get the location the mutation is added to the error list.
then HTable#backgroundFlushCommits takes all mutations from the error list and adds them to the write buffer list.
This should result in two references to the same mutation being in the write buffer list twice. It's not a big deal as two of the same mutation being executed should be ideponent (unless the two puts are executed across ms boundaries.)
