Summary:
[hbase] provide multiple language bindings for HBase
Description:
There have been a number of requests for multiple language bindings for HBase. While there is now a REST interface, this may not be suited for high-volume applications. A couple of suggested approaches have been proposed:
Provide a Thrift based API (very fast socket based but some of the languages are not well supported)
Provide a JSON based API over sockets. (faster than REST, but probably slower than Thrift)
Others?
