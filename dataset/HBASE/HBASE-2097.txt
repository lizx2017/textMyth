Summary:
Deadlock between HRegion.put and HRegion.close
Description:
HBASE-2037 added a bunch of fixes but also a deadlock:
HRegion.put:
splitsAndClosesLock.readLock().lock();
newScannerLock.writeLock().lock();
HRegion.close
newScannerLock.writeLock().lock();
try {
  splitsAndClosesLock.writeLock().lock();
To recreate, start a PerformanceEvaluation on standalone and it happens roughly 75% of the time.
