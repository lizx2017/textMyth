Summary:
If re-transition to OPENING during log replay fails, server aborts. Instead, should just cancel region open.
Description:
The Progressable used on region open to tickle the ZK OPENING node to prevent the master from timing out a region open operation will currently abort the RegionServer if this fails for some reason. However it could be "normal" for an RS to have a region open operation aborted by the master, so should just handle as it does other places by reverting the open.
We had a cluster trip over some other issue (for some reason, the tickle was not happening in < 30 seconds, so master was timing out every time). Because of the abort on BadVersion, this eventually led to every single RS aborting itself eventually taking down the cluster.
