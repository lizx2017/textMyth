Summary:
[0.92 UNIT TESTS] testCreateTableRPCTimeOut sets rpc timeout to 1500ms and leaves it (testHundredsOfTable fails w/ 1500ms timeout)
Description:
I see that in 0.92 #502 and #501 that TestAdmin.testHundredsOfTable fails because socket times out after 1500ms. I see in TestAdmin that before this test runs, testCreateTableRPCTimeOut sets the socket timeout to 1500 and then does not set it back. Maybe the obnoxious testHundredsOfTable will pass more often if it has the default rpc timeout.
