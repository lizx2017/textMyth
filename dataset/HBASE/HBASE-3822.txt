region server stuck in waitOnAllRegionsToClose
Description:
The regionserver is not able to exit because the rs thread is stuck here

In CloseRegionHandler.process() we do not call removeFromOnlineRegions() if there is an exception. (In this case I suspect there was a log-rolling exception because of another issue)
// Close the region
try {
// TODO: If we need to keep updating CLOSING stamp to prevent against
// a timeout if this is long-running, need to spin up a thread?
if (region.close(abort) == null)
{ // This region got closed. Most likely due to a split. So instead // of doing the setClosedState() below, let's just ignore and continue. // The split message will clean up the master state. LOG.warn("Can't close region: was already closed during close(): " + regionInfo.getRegionNameAsString()); return; }
} catch (IOException e)
{ LOG.error("Unrecoverable exception while closing region " + regionInfo.getRegionNameAsString() + ", still finishing close", e); }
this.rsServices.removeFromOnlineRegions(regionInfo.getEncodedName());

I think we set the closing flag on the region, it won't be taking any more requests, it is as good as offline.
Either we should refine the check in waitOnAllRegionsToClose() or CloseRegionHandler.process() should remove the region from online-regions set.
