Summary:
HConnectionImplementation is closed but not deleted
Description:
In abort() of HConnectionManager$HConnectionImplementation, instance of HConnectionImplementation is marked as this.closed=true.
There is no way for client application to check the hbase client connection whether it is still opened/good (this.closed=false) or not. We need a method to validate the state of a connection like isClosed().
public boolean isClosed(){
   return this.closed;
} 
Once the connection is closed and it should get deleted. Client application still gets a connection from HConnectionManager.getConnection(Configuration) and tries to make a RPC call to RS, since connection is already closed, HConnectionImplementation.getRegionServerWithRetries throws RetriesExhaustedException with error message
Caused by: org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.RetriesExhaustedException: Trying to contact region server null for region , row 'xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxx', but failed after 10 attempts.
