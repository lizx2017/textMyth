Summary:
Gets/Puts with many columns send the RegionServer into an "endless" loop
Description:
This came from the mailing this:
We were able to replicate this behavior in a pseudo-distributed hbase
(hbase-0.94.1) environment. We wrote a test program that creates a test
table "MyTestTable" and populates it with random rows, then it creates a
row with 60,000 columns and repeatedly updates it. Each column has a 18
byte qualifier and a 50 byte value. In our tests, when we ran the
program, we usually never got beyond 15 updates before it would flush
for a really long time. The rows that are being updated are about 4MB
each (minues any hbase metadata).
It doesn't seem like it's caused by GC. I turned on gc logging, and
didn't see any long pauses. This is the gc log during the flush.

This is the regionserver log with debug on during the same flush

This is the test program we wrote.

You should be able to just compile it, and run it against a running
HBase cluster.
