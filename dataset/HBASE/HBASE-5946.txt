Summary:
Thrift Filter Language documentation is inconsistent
Description:
Syntax: SingleColumnValueFilter(<compare operator>, '<comparator>', '<family>', '<qualifier>), as described here: http://hbase.apache.org/book/thrift.html is not correct.
The correct syntax is: SingleColumnValueFilter('<family>', '<qualifier>', <compare operator>, '<comparator>')
Also, <comparator> parameter must always contain the comparator, e.g. binary: or binaryprefix: etc. Without it (except PrefixFilter and maybe some other filters) TSocket class throws TTransportException: TSocket read 0 bytes.
All examples in section 9.3.1.9. Individual Filter Syntax are written without comparator.
There also a typo:
in section 9.3.1.9.12 - Family Filter, syntax and example described for QualifierFilter
