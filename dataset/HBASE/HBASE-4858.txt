Summary:
hbase-site.xml example in quickstart doesn't work in Linux
Description:
Under Linux with OpenJDK 1.6, using a file:///XX URL in the config file creates a directory called 'file:' in the hbase root directory. If I use a standard Unix absolute path, it works as expected. This may work on other platforms, but it would be good to add a note in the example:
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<?xml-stylesheet type="text/xsl" href="configuration.xsl"?>
<configuration>
  <property>
    <name>hbase.rootdir</name>
    <!-- Depending on your platform, this may create a 'file:' directory
         in hbase home instead of the desired behavior. Try using a standard
         platform specific absolute path instead. -->
    <value>file:///DIRECTORY/hbase</value>
  </property>
</configuration>
