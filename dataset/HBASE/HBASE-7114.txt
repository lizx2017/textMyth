Summary:
Increment does not extend Mutation but probably should
Description:
Increment is the only operation in the class of mutators that does not extend Mutation. It mostly duplicates what Mutation provides, but not quite. The signatures for setWriteToWAL and getFamilyMap are slightly different. This can be inconvenient because it requires special case code and therefore could be considered an API design nit. Unfortunately it is not a simple change: The interface is marked stable and the internals of the family map are different from other mutation types. The latter is why I suspect this was not addressed when Mutation was introduced.
