Summary:
Scanner is jumping a full cache of rows
Description:
I ran my program multiple times and this is happening almost all the time.
Basically, the ResultScanner is skipping a full cache of rows. I set my caching size to 1000, and when I expect to see row 60000 it gave me 60999.
My code (will attach here) is creating a new table with a single column family and qualifier, and then write 1 million rows with ascending keys, then immediately read them back to verify.
The HBase code is from:
http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/hadoop/hbase/trunk at
Exported revision 821973.
