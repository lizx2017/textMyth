Summary:
HLog sequence number is obtained outside updateLock
Description:
In one of the overloads of HLog.append, obtainSeqNum() is called before this.updateLock is acquired. This means that it's possible for some other thread to have a higher sequence number but achieve its write first, and hence the lastSeqWritten map can become incorrect.
