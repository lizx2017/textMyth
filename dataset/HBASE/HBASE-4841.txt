Summary:
If I call split fast enough, while inserting, rows disappear.
Description:
I'll attach a unit test for this. Basically if you call split, while inserting data you can get to the point to where the cluster becomes unstable, or rows will disappear. The unit test gives you some flexibility of:
How many rows
How wide the rows are
The frequency of the split.
The default settings crash unit tests or cause the unit tests to fail on my laptop. On my macbook air, i could actually turn down the number of total rows, and the frequency of the splits which is surprising. I think this is because the macbook air has much better IO than my backup acer.
