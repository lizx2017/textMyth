Summary:
clusterId is not set in conf properly if only TableMapReduceUtil.initCredentials() is called
Description:
clusterId is not set in the job's conf correctly if only TableMapReduceUtil.initCredentials() is called and thus fails to include the token when using an hbase client in any of the job's tasks. This is a regression.
