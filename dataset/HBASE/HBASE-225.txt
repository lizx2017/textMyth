Summary:
[hbase] TestCleanRegionServerExit fails too often on Hudson
Description:
TestCleanRegionServerExit fails too often on Hudson, making other unrelated builds fail. The primary reason for this is that the client runs out of retries before the master gets around to reassigning the regions from the region server that exited. We had lowered the number of retries in an attempt to make the test run faster but perhaps were too agressive.
