Summary:
Avoid call to zk in HRegionServer#getMaster() to log the master address which already read from the zk.
Description:
To log the master address we are making an extra call to zookeeper which we already read and trying to connect to the address.
      masterServerName = this.masterAddressManager.getMasterAddress();
      if (masterServerName == null) {
        if (!keepLooping()) {
          // give up with no connection.
          LOG.debug("No master found and cluster is stopped; bailing out");
          return null;
        }
        LOG.debug("No master found; retry");
        previousLogTime = System.currentTimeMillis();

        sleeper.sleep();
        continue;
      }

      masterIsa =
        new InetSocketAddress(masterServerName.getHostname(), masterServerName.getPort());

      LOG.info("Attempting connect to Master server at " +
        this.masterAddressManager.getMasterAddress());
