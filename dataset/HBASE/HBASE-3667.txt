Summary:
[metrics] regionserver requests not showing in jmx on cluster start but after an individual server start, it starts to work
Description:
Last night on one of our clusters I ran into the strange problem where metrics were showing in jmx, all but request rate seemingly. Then, I restarted a single cluster member and it started reporting requests/second. I did a few others and they started working. Its strange. Gary was helping out and noted that requests is only metric to use new MetricsRate otherwise, its not clear why it'd go wonky. This issue is placeholder for figuring out whats up here.
