Summary:
getLastIncrement() can miss some key-values
Description:
In getLastIncrement() there is an assumption that memstore only scan will never return multiple versions of a kv
// found everything we were looking for, done
if (results.size() == expected)
{ return results; }
Based on this assumption the code does an early out after it finds the expected number of key-value pairs in the memstore. But what if there were multiple versions of the same kv returned by the memstore scan? I think it is possible when the memstore has a snapshot pending to be written out. A version of the key can be returned each from the online and from the snapshot memory.
