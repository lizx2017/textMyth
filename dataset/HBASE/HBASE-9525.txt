Summary:
"Move" region right after a region split is dangerous
Description:
I ran into a situation where the CM issued a move for a region just after a region was split. The master went bonkers since the master honored the CM request, and assigned the split region, but subsequently all the region state assumptions on this (split)region was messed up. I started seeing log lines lines like "THIS SHOULD NOT HAPPEN". Also, it created other problems - a compaction on original region happened on the new assignee, and then the daughter regions started seeing issues to do with store files missing, etc., etc.
I will upload the logs shortly.
