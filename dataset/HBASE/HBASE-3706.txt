Summary:
On node crash (RS+DN), the replication of blocks can up latency
Description:
HDFS is kinda dumb regards rereplication in that if it notices missing replicas, its crass in the way it goes about making redress; there is no facility for limiting the rate of rereplication (HDFS-1195). We've seen the case where hdfs is rereplicating at such a rate after DN crash, it fills the network hampering data serving. This issue is about noting this prob. and helping out/keeping an eye on HDFS-1195.
