Summary:
Reverse order of AssignmentManager and MetaNodeTracker in ZooKeeperWatcher
Description:
Over in HBASE-3159, I reported a similar double-opened issue but for META. This is because of the fact that the META unassigned znode has two different consumers MetaNodeTracker in use by the CatalogTracker and AssignmentManager which uses it for normal regions-in-transition stuff.
The AssignmentManager needs to go first, otherwise we can get double handling of state transitions.
