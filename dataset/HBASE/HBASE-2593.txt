Summary:
Race Between Log Splitting and Log Writing
Description:
The current method for recovering the lease in HLog.splitLog() is flawed. Between the time that the regionserver is marked as dead and fs.append is issued, the regionserver could exit a GC pause and maintain the lease. In this case, fs.append() would continually fail. The master needs to not only recover the lease in splitLog but also break the lease so regionserver writes will no longer pass.
