Summary:
[hbase] Region split broken
Description:
testSplitRegionIsDeleted failed in Hadoop-Nightly #207. From the log for that test (attached), it appears that it tries to split the region 3 times instead of just once.
I did see the error:
[junit] Exception in thread "HMaster.metaScanner" java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Can't build a writable with empty bytes array
[junit] at org.apache.hadoop.hbase.util.Writables.getWritable(Writables.java:77)
[junit] at org.apache.hadoop.hbase.HMaster$BaseScanner.scanRegion(HMaster.java:272)
[junit] at org.apache.hadoop.hbase.HMaster$MetaScanner.scanOneMetaRegion(HMaster.java:602)
[junit] at org.apache.hadoop.hbase.HMaster$MetaScanner.maintenanceScan(HMaster.java:659)
[junit] at org.apache.hadoop.hbase.HMaster$BaseScanner.run(HMaster.java:175)
[junit] at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:595)
and afterwards there were no reports from the metaScanner so this may be related to HADOOP-1730
