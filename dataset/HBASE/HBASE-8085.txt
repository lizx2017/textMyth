Summary:
Backport the fix for Bytes.toStringBinary() into 94 (HBASE-6991)
Description:
there is a bug in Bytes.toStringBinary(), which will return the same string for 1) byte[] a =
{'\\', 'x', 'D', 'A'}
2) "\xDA".
It seems this bug has already been fixed in trunk with HBASE 6991. We should backport it to 94.
