Summary:
NPE in housekeeping kills RS
Description:
Saw this on Zhenyu's 0.20.1 cluster (which for some weird reason seems to have many issues):
2009-11-30 16:44:48,170 FATAL org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.HRegionServer: Unhandled exception. Aborting...
java.lang.NullPointerException
 at org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.HRegionServer.housekeeping(HRegionServer.java:1280)
 at org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.HRegionServer.run(HRegionServer.java:590)
 at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:619)
This reminds me of HBASE-1386 and in fact this could be the same issue (but I can't confirm). Searching on the web gives me some hits and this is particularly interesting http://forums.sun.com/thread.jspa?threadID=5379669
