Summary:
[hbase] when the master times out a region server's lease, it is too aggressive in reclaiming the server's log
Description:
When a region server's lease times out, the master immediately begins trying to split the server's log file. There have been cases where a region server was just a little late reporting to the master and the master had already started trying to reclaim the server's log, even though the server was still writing to it.
There needs to be some kind of "grace period" in which, if the region server reports in, the master re-instates the server. If the "grace period" expires, then the master should start processing the server's log.
