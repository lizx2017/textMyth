Summary:
HBASE-451 improperly breaks public API HRegionInfo#getTableDesc
Description:
After HBASE-451, HRegionInfo#getTableDesc has been modified to always return null.
One immediate effect is broken unit tests.
That aside, it is not in the spirit of deprecation to actually break the method until after the deprecation cycle, it's a bug.
