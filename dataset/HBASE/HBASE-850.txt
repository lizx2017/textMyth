Summary:
bin/hbase should check `which java` to find java
Description:
Currently, the bin/hbase script tries to find java in JAVA_HOME/bin/java. If JAVA_HOME isn't set, it errors out.
Instead, I think it should check `which java 2>/dev/null` to see if there is a java on the user's PATH. If a java is on the user's path, the script should just set JAVA=java.
