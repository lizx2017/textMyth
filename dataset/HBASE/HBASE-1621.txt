Summary:
merge tool should work on online cluster
Description:
taking down the entire cluster to merge 2 regions is a pain, i dont see why the table or regions specifically couldnt be taken offline, then merged then brought back up.
this might need a new API to the regionservers so they can take direction from not just the master.
