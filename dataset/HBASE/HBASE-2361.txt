Summary:
WALEdit broke replication scope
Description:
Before HBASE-2283, each KV had a HLogKey with a replication scope. Now a key applies to a list of KVs that spans multiple families so a single scope doesn't work anymore. Multiple possible solutions:
Each KV have their own scope. We already ruled that out in a previous jira since that means the scope would end up in the HFiles.
Store pairs of scope/KV in WALEdit instead of straight KVs.
Have 2 parallel lists in WALEdit, one for KVs and the other for scopes.
Subclass KV and add the scope there, those would be created when inserted in the WAL and would contain the KV stored in the HFiles.
I'm sure there are other solutions, discuss.
