Summary:
Increment operations can break when qualifiers are split between memstore/snapshot and storefiles
Description:
Doing investigation around some observed resetting counter behavior.
An optimization was added to check memstore/snapshots first and then check storefiles if not all counters were found. However it looks like this introduced a bug when columns for a given row/family in a single increment operation are spread across memstores and storefiles.
The results from get operations on both memstores and storefiles are appended together but when processed are expected to be fully sorted. This can lead to invalid results.
Need to sort the combined result of memstores + storefiles.
