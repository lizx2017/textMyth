Summary:
MetaScanner.metaScan doesn't take configurations
Description:
HBASE-2468 added a bunch of code in MetaScanner.metaScan, and this particular line is wrong:
+    // if row is not null, we want to use the startKey of the row's region as
+    // the startRow for the meta scan.
+    if (row != null) {
+      HTable metaTable = new HTable(HConstants.META_TABLE_NAME);   <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
+      Result startRowResult = metaTable.getRowOrBefore(startRow,
+          HConstants.CATALOG_FAMILY);
+      if (startRowResult == null) {
If the user specified any new configuration in his code, like ZK's parent znode, then it will miss it. This should use the HTable constructor that takes a Configuration and pass the one it already has.
I found this with my TestReplication test in HBASE-2223.
