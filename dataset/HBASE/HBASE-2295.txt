Summary:
Row locks may deadlock with themselves
Description:
Row locks in HRegion are keyed by a int-sized hash of the row key. It's perfectly possible for two rows to hash to the same key. So, if any client tries to lock both rows, it will deadlock with itself. Switching to a 64-bit hash is an improvement but still sketchy.
