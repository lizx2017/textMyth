Not starting ReplicationSink when using custom implementation for the ReplicationSink.
Description:
Not starting ReplicationSink when using custom implementation for the ReplicationSink.
if (this.replicationSourceHandler == this.replicationSinkHandler &&
  this.replicationSourceHandler != null) {
   this.replicationSourceHandler.startReplicationService();
} else if (this.replicationSourceHandler != null) {
  this.replicationSourceHandler.startReplicationService();
} else if (this.replicationSinkHandler != null) {
  this.replicationSinkHandler.startReplicationService();
}
ReplicationSource and Sink are different as there is custom impl for ReplicationSink. We can not have else ifs
