Summary:
META not cleaned up after table deletion/truncation
Description:
On deletion or truncation of a table (including major compacting the META), the entries for that table should get deleted in the META table. That doesnt happen and the entries remain. This causes Region Not Hosting exceptions when doing insertions into the table later on. The files for the deleted table do get deleted from the FS though.
