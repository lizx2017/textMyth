Summary:
new o.a.h.h.mapreduce package is incompletely ported to o.a.h.mapreduce
Description:
There should be no use of classes from o.a.h.mapred in o.a.h.h.mapreduce, only the classes in o.a.h.mapreduce. To do so invites problems by mixing compatibility mode with the >= 0.20 mapreduce classes.
From Yair Even-Zohar up on hbase-users@
Here is a snippet from TableOutputFormat (The new one in org.apache.hadoop.hbase.mapreduce)
import org.apache.hadoop.mapred.JobConf;
import org.apache.hadoop.mapred.FileOutputFormat;

public class TableOutputFormat extends
    FileOutputFormat<ImmutableBytesWritable, Put> {
Notice that TableOutputFormat extends the old (mapred) FileOutputFormat and thus the old OutputFormat.
Additionally, JobConf is deprecated too but that's beside the current point.
