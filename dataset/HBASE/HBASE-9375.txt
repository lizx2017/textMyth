Summary:
[REST] Querying row data gives all the available versions of a column
Description:
In the hbase shell, when a user tries to get a value related to a column, hbase returns only the latest value. But using the REST API returns HColumnDescriptor.DEFAULT_VERSIONS versions by default.
The behavior should be consistent with the hbase shell.
