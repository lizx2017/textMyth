Summary:
[docs] Add docs about Region server "draining" mode
Description:
HBASE-4298 introduced "draining" mode for region servers to optimize rolling restarts to allow for multiple RS's going down simultaneously. There is a good blog post from the original author.
I've added highlights from and and a link to it in the Node Decommissioning section of the ref guide.
