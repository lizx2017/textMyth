Summary:
ZK dependencies - explicitly add them until ZK artifacts are published to mvn repository
Description:
Currently we include the binary of zookeeper but we need to add the dependencies explicitly as well ( similar to a recent issue , related to thrift ).
zk depends on log4j / jline .
log4j is already in.
This patch adds jline to the dependencies explicitly.
