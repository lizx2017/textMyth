Summary:
Don't open a region we already have opened!
Description:
See this thread: http://search-hadoop.com/?q=Errors+after+major+compaction&fc_project=HBase
In it, Eran has snippets from a log that show us being asked open a region we already have opened.
We need to make sure that the root issue is addressed – the races around assignment and its timeouts – and then after that do something like a check if we already have region open before we queue an open (we can't return message to the master from down inside the regionserver event handlers).
