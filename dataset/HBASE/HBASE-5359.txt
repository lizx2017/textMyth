Summary:
Alter in the shell can be too quick and return before the table is altered
Description:
This seems to be a recent change in behavior but I'm still not sure where it's coming from.
The shell is able to call HMaster.getAlterStatus before the TableEventHandler is able call AM.setRegionsToReopen so that the returned status shows no pending regions. It means that the alter seems "instantaneous" although it's far from completed.
