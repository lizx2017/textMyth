Summary:
[hbase] If a region server cannot talk to the master after several attempts, it should shut itself down
Description:
If a region server cannot contact the master after a configurable number of tries, it should shut itself down.
If the region server cannot contact the master,
if the master is alive but the network is partitioned, the master will probably time out the region server's lease and try to recover the server's log and reassign the regions the server is serving.
if the master has died, and subsequently restarts, it will be reassigning regions anyway, so the region server should stop serving the regions.
