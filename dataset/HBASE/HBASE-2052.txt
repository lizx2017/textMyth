Summary:
Make hbase more 'live' when comes to noticing table creation, splits, etc., for 0.20.3
Description:
Clusters > 10 are less frequent that smaller clusters. Defaults for when messages are sent from regionserver to master would seem to favor clusters that are much larger than ten nodes. This issue is about changing them so the basic hbase setup is more live. Its about downing the interval between RS sending messages from 3 to 1 second and of making clients retry more frequently at least at the start of the timeout period so they pick up changes the quicker. This should help with stuff like noticing splits and new regions coming on line. See HBASE-1892 for background.
