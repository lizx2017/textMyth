Summary:
Fix REST tests on trunk
Description:
Most of the REST tests do not pass on trunk. Most likely because configuration is being generated internally within REST classes rather than being passed in, so when tests override configs they are not getting picked up.
There was a similar issue already fixed with thrift and avro.
