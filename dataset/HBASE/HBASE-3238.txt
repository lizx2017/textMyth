Summary:
HBase needs to have the CREATE permission on the parent of its ZooKeeper parent znode
Description:
Upon startup, HBase attempts to create its zookeeper.parent.znode in ZooKeeper, it does so using ZKUtil.createAndFailSilent which as its name seems to imply will fail silent if the znode exists. But if HBase does not have the CREATE permission on its zookeeper.parent.znode parent znode then the create attempt will fail with a org.apache.zookeeper.KeeperException$NoAuthException and will terminate the process.
In a production environment where ZooKeeper has a managed namespace it is not possible to give HBase CREATE permission on the parent of its parent znode.
ZKUtil.createAndFailSilent should therefore be modified to check that the znode exists using ZooKeeper.exist prior to attempting to create it.
