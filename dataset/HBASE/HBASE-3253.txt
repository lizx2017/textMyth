Summary:
Thrift's missing from all the repositories in pom.xml
Description:
Follow up to what I said on the mailing list:
Currently both trunk and 0.90's pom.xml are incomplete, we were
relying on Ryan's repo have the thrift pom but now that it was changed
to Stack's new comers cannot compile the project since that pom is
missing. Reported by kzk9 on IRC.
So either we had Ryan's repo back in the pom, or Stack copies the
files to his own repo, or we add a FB's repo that has it.
I'm going to do it quickly by adding back Ryan's repo, it's pretty harmless.
