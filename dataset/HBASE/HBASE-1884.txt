Summary:
THBase WAL recovery sometimes needs to access __GLOBAL_TRX_TABLE__, but it may be stuck offline waiting on current region opening
Description:
Coming back after a crash, we have region A, and region for _GLOBAL_TRX_LOG. Assuming that there was a pending trx in A at the time of commit, it will find that in the WAL, and need to ask __GLOBAL_TRX_LOG_ what happend with that transaction. However, if we are opening region A before region _GLOBAL_TRX_LOG_ then we will fail to be able to query as we are blocking the opening of the _GLOBAL_TRX_LOG_ region, but we need it to open region A.
