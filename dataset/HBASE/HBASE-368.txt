Summary:
[hbase] Remove deprecated HClient class
Description:
HClient has been replaced by HTable and HBaseAdmin. Other than one test case (for HClient) there are no other references to HClient in the source tree.
We would like to remove HClient but before we do, we would like to hear from other HBase users if doing so would be a problem for them, and if so, an estimated timeframe by which they would no longer need HClient.
