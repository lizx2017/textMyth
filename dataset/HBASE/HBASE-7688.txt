Summary:
Master coprocessor RPCs don't propagate exceptions
Description:
I was working on some coprocessor tests, and was wondering why exceptions weren't bubbling up while calling checkFailed on my RpcController.
Turns out, that HMaster's execMasterService seems to be sending the wrong RpcController (that happens to be null in my case) to the methods.
I have a fix that appears to work, but I am not familiar enough with the code to know that it's the write one.
Version I am working on has the git sha 9a322b0
