Summary:
fs.automatic.close isn't passed to FileSystem
Description:
Currently we do this:
      this.conf.set("fs.defaultFS", this.conf.get("hbase.rootdir"));
      this.fs = FileSystem.get(this.conf);

      // Register shutdown hook for HRegionServer, runs an orderly shutdown
      // when a kill signal is recieved.  Shuts down hdfs too if its supposed.
      Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook(new ShutdownThread(this,
        Thread.currentThread(), this.shutdownHDFS));
      this.conf.setBoolean("fs.automatic.close", false);
The boolean is never passed to FileSystem. This doesn't manifest on a single instance but on my cluster when I manually stop region servers they aren't able to close their regions and on restart the master has to split a ton of logs. The fix is minor so I will commit directly.
