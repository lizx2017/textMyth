Summary:
HMaster web ui does not load if there are no region servers
Description:
HMaster WebUI (60010) does not load until atleast one of the RegionServers register with HMaster.
One has to find out from hmaster logs that there are no region servers. It would be good to init webUI and show that there are no RegionServers in cluster.
