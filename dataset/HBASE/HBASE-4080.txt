Summary:
Instance handed out from HTablePool is treated as HTable whereas it should be HTableInterface
Description:
RESTServlet uses HTablePool. The problem here is that the factory returns an HTableInterface when we ask
it to create an HTable instance, but at same time, we are just assuming the HTableInterface
is an HTable. Stack suggested adding the two
methods (getRegionsInfo and setAutoFlush) we need to HTableInterface.
setAutoFlush was requested to be added to HTableInterface before.
getRegionsInfo is deprecated. So we should add getRegionLocations to HTableInterface.
We should also consider the new methods Doug is adding in HBASE-4079
