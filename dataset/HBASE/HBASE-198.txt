Summary:
[hbase] When the master times out a region servers lease, the region server may not restart
Description:
Hadoop-Nightly 297 failed because:
The region server's lease expired (Why? was the heartbeat thread starved?)
The region server gets a call startup message
The master splits the region server's log and deletes it.
I think that when the region server called log.closeAndDelete(), it got an exception (because the file no longer existed) at that point it said "error restarting server" and quit. From there on the master is just looping because there is no region server to talk to
We should probably just log an error for log.closeAndDelete() and proceed with region server restart.
Also for that test, we should probably increase the lease timeout and make the lease timeout check happen less frequently accordingly
