Summary:
Scheduled tasks in distributed log splitting not in sync with ZK
Description:
This is in continuation to HBASE-3889:
Note that there must be more slightly off here. Although the splitlogs znode is now empty the master is still stuck here:
Doing distributed log split in hdfs://localhost:8020/hbase/.logs/10.0.0.65,60020,1305406356765 
- Waiting for distributed tasks to finish. scheduled=2 done=1 error=0   4380s

Master startup 
- Splitting logs after master startup   4388s
There seems to be an issue with what is in ZK and what the TaskBatch holds. In my case it could be related to the fact that the task was already in ZK after many faulty restarts because of the NPE. Maybe it was added once (since that is keyed by path, and that is unique on my machine), but the reference count upped twice? Now that the real one is done, the done counter has been increased, but will never match the scheduled.
The code could also check if ZK is actually depleted, and therefore treat the scheduled task as bogus? This of course only treats the symptom, not the root cause of this condition.
