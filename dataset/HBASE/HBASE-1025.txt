Summary:
Reconstruction log playback has no bounds on memory used
Description:
Makes a TreeMap and just keeps adding edits without regard for size of edits applied; could cause OOME (I've not seen a definitive case though have seen an OOME around time of a reconstructionlog replay â€“ perhaps this the straw that broke the fleas antlers?)
