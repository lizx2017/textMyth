Summary:
Put errors are burried by the RetriesExhaustedException
Description:
When a user tries to put into non-existing column family, all the NoSuchColumnFamilyException errors get buried (many of them, since we retry 10 times by default) and then we throw useless RetriesExhaustedException that tells user nothing but the fact that the put operation has failed.
