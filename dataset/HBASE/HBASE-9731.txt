Summary:
updatesBlockedSeconds RegionServer metric should not be a histogram
Description:
I just noticed that updatesBlockedSeconds is declared as a histogram (in 0.94), which makes little sense (neither mean, nor any percentiles are useful, as it is an every increasing number).
This metric measures the total time the region server has blocked writes due to flushes that could not proceed due to too many store files... In that it should be a number. Unless there are objections I will make this so.
Also, it looks like this metric was lost in 0.96 (Elliott Clark, stack, fyi).
