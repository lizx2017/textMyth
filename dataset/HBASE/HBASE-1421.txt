Summary:
Processing a regionserver message -- OPEN, CLOSE, SPLIT, etc. -- and if we're carrying more than one message in payload, if exception, all messages that follow are dropped on floor
Description:
Just saw this in pset cluster. Marking blocker.
We had an incidence of HBASE-1344 on our 0.19.x era hbase cluster. The report from the regionserver was carrying at least two open messages. The first provoked the exception, the second open message was never processed. Regionserver thought it had successfully opened region. Master didn't know anything about it.
