Summary:
A thread named LruBlockCache.EvictionThread remains after the shutdown of a cluster
Description:
There is no cleanup function in hbase.io.hfile.CacheConfig. The cache is a singleton, shared by all cluster if we launch more than one cluster on a test.
Related code is:
  /**
   * Static reference to the block cache, or null if no caching should be used
   * at all.
   */
  private static BlockCache globalBlockCache;

  /** Boolean whether we have disabled the block cache entirely. */
  private static boolean blockCacheDisabled = false;

  /**
   * Returns the block cache or <code>null</code> in case none should be used.
   *
   * @param conf  The current configuration.
   * @return The block cache or <code>null</code>.
   */
  private static synchronized BlockCache instantiateBlockCache(){
     // initiate globalBlockCache
