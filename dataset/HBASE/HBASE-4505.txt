SubstringComparator - Javadoc refers to a class that doesn't exist
Description:
For example... http://hbase.apache.org/apidocs/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/filter/SubstringComparator.html
"This comparator is for use with ColumnValueFilter,"
No such class exists. It should be SingleColumnValueFilter. The code example is wrong too.
