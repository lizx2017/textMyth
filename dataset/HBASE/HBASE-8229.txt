Summary:
Replication code logs like crazy if a target table cannot be found.
Description:
One of our RS/DN machines ran out of diskspace on the partition to which we write the log files.
It turns out we still had a table in our source cluster with REPLICATION_SCOPE=>1 that did not have a matching table in the remote cluster.
In then logged a long stack trace every 50ms or so, over a few days that filled up our log partition.
Since ReplicationSource cannot make any progress in this case anyway, it should probably sleep a bit before retrying (or at least limit the rate at which it spews out these exceptions to the log).
