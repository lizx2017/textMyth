Summary:
Log lease recovery catches IOException too widely
Description:
In HLog.recoverLog, all IOExceptions are caught. This code should only spin for the case of AlreadyBeingCreatedException, but currently will spin on any IOException, even though others may well be permanent state (eg the log directory has been chowned to someone else)
