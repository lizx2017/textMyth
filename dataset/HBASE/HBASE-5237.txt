Summary:
Addendum for HBASE-5160 and HBASE-4397
Description:
As part of HBASE-4397 there is one more scenario where the patch has to be applied.
RegionPlan plan = getRegionPlan(state, forceNewPlan);
      if (plan == null) {
        debugLog(state.getRegion(),
            "Unable to determine a plan to assign " + state);
        return; // Should get reassigned later when RIT times out.
      }
I think in this scenario also
this.timeoutMonitor.setAllRegionServersOffline(true);
this should be done.
