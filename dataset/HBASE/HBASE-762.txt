Summary:
deleteFamily takes timestamp, should only take row and family. Javadoc describes both cases but only implements the timestamp case.
Description:
The three version of deleteFamily in client.HTable (Text, String, byte[]) have varying descriptions about whether they take timestamps or not.
public void deleteFamily(org.apache.hadoop.io.Text row, org.apache.hadoop.io.Text family, long timestamp) throws IOException
Delete all cells for a row with matching column family at all timestamps.
public void deleteFamily(String row, String family, long timestamp) throws IOException
Delete all cells for a row with matching column family at all timestamps.
public void deleteFamily(byte[] row, byte[] family, long timestamp) throws IOException
Delete all cells for a row with matching column family with timestamps less than or equal to timestamp.
These will become:
public void deleteFamily(org.apache.hadoop.io.Text row, org.apache.hadoop.io.Text family) throws IOException
Delete all cells for a row with matching column family at all timestamps.
public void deleteFamily(String row, String family) throws IOException
Delete all cells for a row with matching column family at all timestamps.
public void deleteFamily(byte[] row, byte[] family) throws IOException
Delete all cells for a row with matching column family at all timestamps.
Per Jean-Daniel's comment, deleteAll should then not permit families. I'm unsure whether this is currently allowed or not, but the documentation must be updated either way.
Will post patch after more thorough testing.
