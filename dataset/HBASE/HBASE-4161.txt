Summary:
Incorrect use of listStatus() in HBase region initialization.
Description:
While opening a region, the HBase regionserver tries to list all the children in a "recovered.edits" directory. This directory may not exist and depending on the version of HDFS listStatus() might return null or an exception. If it does throw an exception the entire process of opening the region is aborted, just because the recovered.edits directory is not present.
