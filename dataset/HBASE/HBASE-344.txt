Summary:
[hbase] Performance - add a block cache
Description:
A block cache would cache fixed size blocks (default 64k) of data read from HDFS by the MapFile. It would help read performance for data close to recently read data (see Bigtable paper, section 6). It would be configurable on a per-column family basis.
