Summary:
Add debug output for when balancer makes bad balance
Description:
Balancer had assertions at end of the balanceCluster method. These assertions trigger on occasion – just did for me and did previously for j-d – only there's no data to analyze when it fails. Add logging data on balancer input and summary.
