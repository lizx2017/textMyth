Summary:
Index NPE on scanning
Description:
I had some tables refuse to find their indexes even though they were defined and had been updated. Scanning .META. I see that some regions from the table don't have the indexes...
Oddly, during the .META. scan, I would see that I had 3 entries per table. (I have very little data in each table, def not splitting yet) But when I visited the UI it showed just one region per table...
This patch also addes some toStrings that helped in diagnostics, and a new null check that I found I needed in IndexedTableScanner
