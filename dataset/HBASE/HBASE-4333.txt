Summary:
Client does not check for holes in .META.
Description:
If there is a temporary hole in .META., the client may get the wrong region from HConnection.locateRegion. HConnectionManager.HConnectionImplementation.locateRegionInMeta should check the end key of the region found with getClosestRowBefore, just as it checks the offline status, when it looks at the region info.
