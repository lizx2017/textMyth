Summary:
Small values for hbase.client.retries.number and ipc.client.connect.max.retries breaks long ops in hbase shell
Description:
After switching hbase shell to small retries numbers (to make Puts to invalida coordinates friendlier to users), we broke long operations on tables (like disabling, truncating, etc) because they use the same config values to control client retries.
Need to roll the change back (will provide a patch) and make a better fix for puts later (after HBASE-2330 is resolved)
