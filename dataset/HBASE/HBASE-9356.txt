Summary:
[0.94] SecureServer.INSECURE_VERSIONS is declared incorrectly
Description:
I just found spurious messages of the form:
2013-08-27 18:52:58,389 WARN org.apache.hadoop.hbase.ipc.SecureServer: Incorrect header or version mismatch from <host:port> got version 3 expected version 4
Version 3 means insecure and the code tries to test for it, but the insecure version are declared in Set<Byte> and are then tested again an int, which apparently is always false.
