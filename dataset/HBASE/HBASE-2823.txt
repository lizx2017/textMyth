Summary:
Entire Row Deletes not stored in Row+Col Bloom
Description:
If the user issues a Row Delete on an family with Row+Col blooms, that information is not currently detected by shouldSeek(). Possible known solutions are:
1. adding Row as Bloom Filter Key on Row Delete, shouldSeek() should do both a Row & Row+Col query for Row+Col filters.
2. keep delete information in a separate storage element.
#1 seems like the best solution, but need to investigate further and fix this problem.
