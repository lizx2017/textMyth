Summary:
TestReplication.queueFailover fails half the time
Description:
TestReplication.queueFailover fails 50% of the time, it's because ZooKeeperWrapper.listZnodes (introduced in HBASE-2694 and missed by HBASE-2735) doesn't use the Watcher it's passed so sometimes ReplicationSource misses hlogs to replicate for the region server we kill. Also it uncovered an issue (while I was fixing the first one) that RepSource ignores log files too quickly when the master is a bit too slow to split logs.
