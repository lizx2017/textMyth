Summary:
[performance regression] appendNoSync/HBASE-4528 doesn't take deferred log flush into account
Description:
Since we upgraded to 0.94.1 from 0.92 I saw that our ICVs are about twice as slow as they were. jstack'ing I saw that most of the time we are waiting on sync()... but those tables have deferred log flush turned on so they shouldn't even be calling it.
HTD.isDeferredLogFlush is currently only called in the append() methods which are pretty much not in use anymore.
