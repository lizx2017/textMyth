Summary:
TestAdmin#testShouldCloseTheRegionBasedOnTheEncodedRegionName shuts down the namespaces table and never starts it up again
Description:
Because the ns table is offline, all subsequent tests just keep retrying and eventually fail (This contribs to the hung TestAdmin we've been seeing of late).
