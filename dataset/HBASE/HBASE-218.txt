Summary:
[hbase] Hudson hangs AFTER test has finished
Description:
Weird. Last night TestBloomFilter was hung after junit had printed test had completed without error. Just now, I noticed a hung TestHStore â€“ again after junit had printed out test had succeeded (Nigel Daley has reported he's seen at least two hangs in TestHStoreFile, perhaps in same location).
Last night and just now I was unable to get a thread dump.
Here is log from around this evenings hang:
