Summary:
[hbase] Some minor improvements to changes in HADOOP-2443
Description:
Stack made a number of suggestions for improvements in the code changes from HADOOP-2443:
Here in HConnectionManager:
+ scannerId = server.openScanner(
+ metaLocation.getRegionInfo().getRegionName(),
+ COLUMN_FAMILY_ARRAY, EMPTY_START_ROW, LATEST_TIMESTAMP,
+ null);
... EMPTY_START_ROW will work but 'startRow' would be easier to read (It'd work too - right?).
Here:
+ } while (startRow.compareTo(EMPTY_START_ROW) != 0);
.. EMPTY_ROW or a new define, LAST_ROW, would have been more readable, don't you think?
This 999... 'trick' should be done as a method - in HTableInfo? - since you do it twice:
+ Text tableKey = new Text(tableName.toString() + ",,99999999999999");
