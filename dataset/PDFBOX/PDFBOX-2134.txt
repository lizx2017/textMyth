Summary:
Parsing of a Type1 font fails with a NPE
Description:
In the attached example, a NPE is thrown in Type1Parser#parseASCII(). The file renders fine in Acrobat and in PDFBox 1.7.x where the font was interpreted using AWT. It seems that the encoding dictionary is missing in the font, but I do not know enough about Type1 font syntax to really understand the problem.
Note: This is just a file from my test suite, not a production problem. I do not know whether the parser or the PDF is wrong, I just know that it "worked before".
