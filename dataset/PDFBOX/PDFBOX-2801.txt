Summary:
SecurityHandler does not tolerate plain-text COSString
Description:
SecurityHandler does not handle the possibility, that a COSString is already plain text if the document is encrypted. This patch makes it tolerant when decrypting COSString, so that if it fails it just logs that and keeps the original content. The code works with all files I have.
