Summary:
v2.0.6 still has hardcoded reference to BouncyCastleProvider
Description:
It seems that PDFBox v2.0.6 still has a hardcoded reference to BouncyCastleProvider, though release note says it was removed.
PDFBOX-2963 - Remove Bouncy Castle Provider Reference
public final class SecurityHandlerFactory
{
    /** Singleton instance */
    public static final SecurityHandlerFactory INSTANCE = new SecurityHandlerFactory();

    static
    {
        Security.addProvider(new BouncyCastleProvider());
    }
Is it as expected that the following modification was only committed to trunk and not committed to 2.0 branch?
https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1789414
I use PDFBox v2.0.5 to parse a pdf file, but don't want it to add dependency to Bouncy Castle because it globally register a Provider instance.
