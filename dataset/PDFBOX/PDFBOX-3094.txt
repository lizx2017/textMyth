Summary:
Merging PDFs with a Form is not retaining the field name values
Description:
Hi,
We are using pdfbox-app-2.0.0. I have 3 pdf forms a.pdf, b.pdf & c.pdf. Each of these forms are filled before i attempt to merge them. I can merge any two of these in any combination and the results looks good.
If i merge any of these forms to the previous merge result then iam loosing field name values in the result and also the form is not editable.
Example:-
a.pdf merged with b.pdf to get ab.pdf
If i merge ab.pdf with a.pdf, the resultant merged form will not have form field values in all the pages. It does have form field values in some pages.
Is there a limitation or restriction on merging same pdf forms more than once ?
Thanks,
-Reddy
