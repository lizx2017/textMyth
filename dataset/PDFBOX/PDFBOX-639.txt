Summary:
PDNameTreeNode: Limits are only set when setting Names
Description:
According PDF 32000-1:2008 Table 36 on page 89, Limits also applies to intermediate nodes. But currently Limits is set only in setNames(Map) (at least after applying the patch to PDFBox-638), which applies to root and leaf nodes only.
