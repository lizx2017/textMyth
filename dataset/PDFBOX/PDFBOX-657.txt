Summary:
PDFToImage does not work with certain fonts (for eg. PDF documents created by MS Office and OpenOffice)
Description:
I created a PDF document using Open Office which contains following fonts:
1. Times New Roman
2. TlwgTypeWriter
3. Courier New
4. Comic MS
None of these fonts get converted to Image file.
I have posted a question on mailing list, and was advised to create this issue. I have uploaded the input PDF and output jpg file to this issue
