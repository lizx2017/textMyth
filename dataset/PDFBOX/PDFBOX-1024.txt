Summary:
Some PDBorderStyleDictionary options not honored
Description:
I'm creating links and using PDBorderStyleDictionary to set the border style, but have noticed that some options are not honored when opening the files. Here are my findings:
PDBorderStyleDictionary.STYLE_UNDERLINE = works correctly.
PDBorderStyleDictionary.STYLE_SOLID = works correctly.
PDBorderStyleDictionary.STYLE_BEVELED = identical to using SOLID.
PDBorderStyleDictionary.STYLE_INSET = identical to using SOLID.
PDBorderStyleDictionary.STYLE_DASHED = identical to using SOLID in appearance, link type under Properties in Acrobat is "Custom".
I've noticed that when I manually create a link in Acrobat the only options are Solid, Dashed and Underline, so maybe the PDF specs have changed and need to be updated in PDFBox as well.
