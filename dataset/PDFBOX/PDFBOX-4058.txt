Summary:
High memory consumption when extracting image from PDF file
Description:
When rendering an image at 300 dpi from the included PDF, my java process uses a huge amount of memory.
The document is only 45 Kb in size and contains 2 pages, my JVM is unable to extract even 1 page with 3G of memory. Setting Xmx to 4G works but is not the solution I want.
The error occurs when calling PDFRenderer.renderImageWithDPI()
I already tried tweaking the memory usage in my application to use a scratch file while loading the document as well as avoiding caching of XObjects as described here: https://pdfbox.apache.org/2.0/faq.html#outofmemoryerror
These didn't work.
The issue can be reproduced using the pdfbox-app utility:
java -Xmx3G -jar pdfbox-app-2.0.8.jar PDFToImage
HighMemoryFootprint.pdf -dpi 300 -color RGB -page 1
What can not be changed?
300 dpi will not be decreased.
Max Java memory will not be increased: 3GB is ridiculous for a 45kb PDF file.
