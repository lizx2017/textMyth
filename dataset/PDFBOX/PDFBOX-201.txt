I believe I've found an error on PDFBox, or at least a
non-standard behavior.
I have a PDF Document I create with PDFBox and then
start importing other PDFs onto it, something like
for every PDF in PDFLIST
mainPdf.import(PDF)
PDF.close
I can have hundreds of PDFs being imported to the main
document.
The thing is that when saving the main Document I
sometimes get the Bad File Descriptor error.
To fix it I had to do something ugly like:
for every PDF in PDFLIST
mainPdf.import(PDF)
toBeErasedPDF.add(PDF)
...
mainPdf.save(..)
mainPdf.close()
for every PDF in toBeErasedPDF
PDF.close
in this way the error goes away but
A) it took me a whole lot of time to realize this
B) I am maintaining in memory lots of unused objects
that could have been GC'd.
Still, this problem does not always arise.
I am attaching two different FO's (correct.fo.xml and
incorrect.fo.xml), where the first one does not show
this error, and the second one does. I am not attaching
code because I am not allowed to, but the idea is to
convert those documents to PDF and add them to the main
PDF document, separately.
I really do not know what is causing the problem in one
doc and not in the other.
BTW I am using version 0.7.2 (and it also happens in 0.7.1)
PS: It seems that I can only add one file? I'm adding
the incorrect one.
Hope this helps,
Best Regards
AndrÃ©s Bernasconi

This FO causes the error mentioned above

Hi AndrÃ©s,
Can you give the nightly build a try
http://www.pdfbox.org/dist
I think another user reported this at one point and if I
remember correctly I couldn't reproduce it, so I think it
might be fixed in CVS.
Give it a try and let me know,
Thanks,
Ben
