Summary:
[PATCH] CharStringRenderer does not render CharString data correctly for Type 2 CFF fonts
Description:
I have a requirement to render the characters from a OTF CFF font and to get the bounding box for each character. I initially tried to use the CharStringRenderer but found the bounding box data was very different to the actual characters. Because the renderer outputs the character as a GeneralPath, I was able to draw this to a bitmap and view it. What I found was that the characters were not being drawn correctly which was effecting the bounds. I will post an image and patch in a moment to show the issue and resolution I used.
