Summary:
DrawPrintTextLocations should limit bbox paint to font bbox when type 3 font has incorrect large glyph bbox
Description:
The cyan rectangle should not be larger than the font bbox. In the attached file, the indidual glyph bboxes are all too large. Also add a comment that calculating glyph bounds for type 3 fonts is futile.
Initial report by Esteban Nicolas Ruiz is here.
