Summary:
Preflight doesn't detect JavaScript for some PDFs
Description:
I just did another round of testing with the Adobe Acrobat Engineering PDFs (using revision 1530740 of Preflight). Some of these files contain JavaScript, but this is not picked up by Preflight. Three examples:
http://acroeng.adobe.com/Test_Files/classic_multimedia//Disney-Flash.pdf
http://acroeng.adobe.com/Test_Files/classic_multimedia//Service%20Form_media.pdf
http://acroeng.adobe.com/Test_Files/classic_multimedia//Trophy.pdf
Both Adobe Acrobat's Preflight component and an additional check with a Hex editor confirm that these files do actually contain JavaScript.
PS: great to see the improvements in the latest version of Preflight!
PPS: the full results for all the files in my test dataset are here, just in case anyone finds this useful:
