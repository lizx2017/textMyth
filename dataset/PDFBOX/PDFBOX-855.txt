Summary:
Extracted Text of MS Word generated PDFs corrupt
Description:
Since Revision 1003195 (PDFBOX-828: fixed some issues with positioning when extracting or rendering text) the text extraction with PDFTextStripper behaves differently for PDF documents generated with the MS Office Word 2007 "Save as PDF" Feature.
For example: The Term "Fachbereichsleiter" changed to "F a c hb e re ic hsle ite r" after PDFBOX-828.
