Summary:
rendering issues during clipping (W/W*-operator)
Description:
As I already stated in this thread [1], there are some rendering issues after adding support for the W/W*-operators (clipping).
E.g. the rendering of Flyer2.pdf from PDFBOX-358 and the doc attached to PDFBOX-478 is getting worse if clipping is activated.
