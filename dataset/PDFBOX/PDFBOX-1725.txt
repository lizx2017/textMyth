Summary:
Character rendered at wrong position
Description:
There is a regression produced by one of the (otherwise successful) changes of this weekend / monday. When rendering the file of PDFBOX-1608, one character is at the wrong position. It is the star below the text "tuscan white bean salad", somewhat in the middle of the image, below the green text "soups and side salad". (the second "vegan modification" in that section) That star is too much on the left. This worked fine on monday before the changes.
To be sure that it isn't because of my own non committed changes, I checked out a "clean" 2.0 version and copied the pdf file in the pdfbox\src\test\resources\input\rendering directory and looked at the pdfbox\target\test-output directory.
