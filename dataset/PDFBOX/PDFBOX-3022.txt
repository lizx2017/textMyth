Summary:
Maven repos should be https
Description:
I noticed there are 2 http Maven repos. Only https should be used for security reasons. See http://blog.ontoillogical.com/blog/2014/07/28/how-to-take-over-any-java-developer/
This one you can simply change from http to https:
./parent/pom.xml: <url>http://jbig2-imageio.googlecode.com/svn/maven-repository/</url>
This one there isn't an https version available:
./parent/pom.xml: <url>http://www.mygrid.org.uk/maven/repository</ur
What library did the mygrid repo have to be added for? The myGrid Maven repository was mainly used for development of Taverna, which has since moved to the Apache Software Foundation, and uses https://repository.apache.org/ and mirrors to Maven Central. Other software they publish has been gradually moved to https://bintray.com/ which should also offer secure connections.
