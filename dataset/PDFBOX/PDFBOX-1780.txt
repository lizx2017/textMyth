Summary:
previous revision is damaged after signing
Description:
Ihave PDF file which was signed by some other application. When I try to sign it with PDFbox, previous revision is damaged. I have discussion at stackoverflow, with Michael Klink.
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19903884/pdf-document-is-modified-by-another-revision/19905271?noredirect=1#19905271
when we see some changes merely was structural. Some changes was just rounding problem - PDFBOX-1778.
When I test, problem of damaged signature was caused from structural change [when there must be direct reference, there was indirect reference and etc..]
So we solve that problem. I will upload damaged PDF document, fixed pdf, and the patch too.
