Summary:
Regression: NullPointerException in subsetting
Description:
The attached test files runs without problems with 2.0.0 but fails with 2.0.1.
Something must have changed concerning the subsetting of TTF files.
Basically I'm trying to reuse a TrueTypeFont for several PDFs to avoid parsing it over and over again.
