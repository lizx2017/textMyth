Summary:
PDDocumentOutline should not have getParent()
Description:
Currently, as PDDocumentOutline is a sub-class of PDOutlineNode, it has a public getParent() method. According to PDF 32000-1:2008 section 12.3.3 there's no Parent entry in an outline dictionary. So we should make PDOutlineNode.getParent() protected and make it public in PDOutlineItem. Patch following soon.
