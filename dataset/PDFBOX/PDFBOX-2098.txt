Summary:
Gouraud shading doesn't appear
Description:
There is a gray gouraud shading on page 6 of the attached PDF file that does't appear. One cause is similar to a few other such examples, e.g. PDFBOX-1947 and PDFBOX-1968, although I don't know if it is a duplicate: the paint context object is created, but getRaster() is never called.
