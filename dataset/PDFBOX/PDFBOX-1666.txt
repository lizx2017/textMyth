Summary:
Missing StemV font descriptor entry when embedding AFM fonts
Description:
When embedding an AFM font the StemV field is missing in the PDF which renders it not PDF/A-1b compliant.
As the StemV value is not included in AFM files it seems to be OK to simply set it to 0. A quick test in Firefox, Chrome, OSX Preview and Acrobat Reader indicates having StemV set to 0 does not impact font rendering in any obvious way. FOP computes StemV from other values stored in PFM files but the fields are optional so can't be relied upon [1] (hence results are often 0 anyway) and Word [2] and iOS [3] seem to use 0 by default.
