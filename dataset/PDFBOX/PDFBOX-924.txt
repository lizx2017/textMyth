Summary:
Image not getting rendered correctly..
Description:
Hi,
I converted a MS office word document in to pdf using open office. And then I used the PDFBox API to convert the pages of the PDF to Image.
Class : PDPage
API : public BufferedImage convertToImage(int imageType, int resolution)
But the image contained ")" characters which were not present in the pdf.
