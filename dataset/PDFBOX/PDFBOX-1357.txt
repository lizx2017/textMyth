Summary:
Missing character encoding in MacRoman & WinAnsi
Description:
During my Preflight refactoring, I encountered some characters mapping that are missing from the WinAnsiEncoding and the MacRomanEncoding.
"nonbreaking space" is missing from the WInAnsi and the MacRoman Encoding that must be mapped with the "space" character.
"soft hyphen" is missing from the WinAnsi encoding that must be mapped with the "hyphen" character.
Unfortunately, they are no clearly defined name for these two characters, so only the getName() method have been updated to return "space" and "hyphen" when code for the "nonbreaking space" or "soft hyphen" is received.
