PDAnnotationLink
Description:
Hi,
I want to draw a text link without any hover effect, neither solid border.
I tried this code but it does not work.
Could you provide me with a solution please? thank you very much.
PDBorderStyleDictionary borderULine = new PDBorderStyleDictionary();
borderULine.setStyle(PDBorderStyleDictionary.STYLE_INSET);
PDAnnotationLink txtLink = new PDAnnotationLink();
txtLink.setRectangle(position);
PDActionURI action = new PDActionURI();
action.setURI(pdfPara.getUri());
txtLink.setAction(action);
txtLink.setBorderStyle(borderULine);
txtLink.setHighlightMode(PDAnnotationLink.HIGHLIGHT_MODE_NONE);
