Summary:
Preflight doesn't report on non-embedded font
Description:
See the following file:
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/9523497/test_noembeddedfonts.pdf
This PDF uses (TrueType) fonts that are not embedded (Arial). However, Preflight does not report on this! (As a double-check I also analysed the file with Acrobat 9's Preflight module, which correctly identifies the problem.)
Additional info: I used build #562 (14-Nov-2012 23:05:44), preflight-1.8.0-20121114.230701-58-jar-with-dependencies.jar from the command line. (Strangely the all-in jar of the more recent build #563 doesn't seem to work at all on my system, but that's another story.)
