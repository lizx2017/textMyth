Summary:
Usage methods references incorrect package
Description:
See https://github.com/apache/pdfbox/blob/trunk/examples/src/main/java/org/apache/pdfbox/examples/util/PrintTextLocations.java#L106
It references the "pdmodel" package instead of "util"
A better solution would be to do PrintTextLocations.class.getName() instead of hardcoding
Edit: same problem in several other examples, e.g. PrintImageLocations.
