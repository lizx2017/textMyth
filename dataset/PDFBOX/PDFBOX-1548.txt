Summary:
PDJpeg gots drawn in wrong colors when resized -> Adobe Reader -> Windows XP & 7
Description:
When creating a PDF and drawing PDJpegs to it, the images' colors are changed / inverted when resizing the PDJpeg(s) before drawing them to the PDF. This issue is only visible on Windows XP and Windows 7 using e.g. Adobe Reader. Preview on Mac or the new PDF-previewer build in Windows 8 is somehow not affected by this.
This is what I do in code:
1.) Create PDDocument
2.) Create HashMap of PDJpegs (for caching purpose):
Create PDJpegs by BufferedImage initialised through ImageIO.read()
Resize PDJpegs by calling setHeight() and setWidth()
Adding PDJpeg to HashMap
3.) Create PDPage and add it to PDDocument
4.) Create PDPageContentStream
5.) Draw some PDJpegs on the PDPage
6.) Close PDPageContentStream
7.) Save PDDocument
8.) Close PDDocument
If the BufferedImages are resized before initialising the PDJpegs, everything works fine, but they don't look that sharp.
Please provide some help, since I'm hanging on this for days now.
