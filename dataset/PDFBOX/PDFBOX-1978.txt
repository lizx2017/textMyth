Summary:
Type1FontUtilTest is non-deterministic
Description:
Type1FontUtilTest uses java.util.Random to generate random test data, which means that it is is non-deterministic.
As discussed in PDFBOX-1977, we should alter this test to make sure that it has deterministic (regression test) functionality as well as the existing non-deterministic (fuzz test) functionality.
