Summary:
Some characters are displayed by default font (not by correct font)
Description:
I have created simple test pdf which contains some central european characters.
Adobe Reader displays text OK.
But this code
BufferedImage bufferedImage = pdPage.convertToImage();
renders some characters with default font (not the one set in content).
