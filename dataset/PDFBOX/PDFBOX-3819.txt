Summary:
TrueType glyphs not displayed in rendering on Windows 10
Description:
On windows 10, most glyphs from PDFBOX-1743 are not displayed, only "test" is shown, for the other lines only squares are shown. The embedded fonts are broken so PDFBox uses the OS fonts.
The format type of the postscript table is 3, which means that no postscript information is provided. Apple advises against this.
