Description:
PDFBox cannot read a PDF that was created using Acrobat v9 standard distiller with default paramater "fast web view" turned on. Receive an error message that says; "This file is not readable". If you turn off (uncheck) the "fast web View" paramater, and regenerate the pdf. PDFBox can read the PDF. Previous versions of Acrobat distiller, it didn't matter if you had "fast web view" turned on or off, it would still read the pdf. Also, Acrobat v9 'professional' distiller does not have this problem. Only PDF's created with Acrobat v9 standard distiller (and "fast web view" turned on) have this proble,
