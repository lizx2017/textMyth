Summary:
NonSequentialPDFParser produces garbage text in document info
Description:
For some documents, NonSequentialPDFParser produces PDDocumentInformation with binary garbage in its fields (title/author/producer/etc). Invocation of PDDocumentInformation.getXXXDate() methods fails with "IOException:Error converting date" for those documents.
Classic PDFParser does not have problems with the same documents.
