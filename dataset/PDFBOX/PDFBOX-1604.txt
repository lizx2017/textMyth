Summary:
FontBox is not storing all subroutines for CID-Keyed OTF CFF fonts possibly leading to rendering / width issues
Description:
When Fontbox reads a CID-Keyed OTF CFF font, it loops through each FDFont correctly and stores information to an array of private dictionaries which is correct. Where it goes wrong though is that the local subroutine indexes for each of these FDFonts is not stored separately and when a FDFont is read, it overwrites the previous local subroutine index. This leads to problems as if the last local subroutine index is small in size, it may request a subroutine which exceeds the size of the index. This then may cause an error further down the line when it comes to parsing that information by a renderer (such as the CharStringRenderer). This may also affect the calculation of character widths etc.
The issue can be seen in the CFFParser.java at line 501 where a single set to the font is used as opposed to storing it in any array structure.
