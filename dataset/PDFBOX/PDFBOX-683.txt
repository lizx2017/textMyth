Summary:
PDFStreamParser can't read "d0" and "d1" operators
Description:
Hi,
I'm using the PDFBox 1.0.0 and I encountered a problem with the parsing of the glyph-XOjbect of Type3 font.
According to PDF Reference, a glyph-XOjbect of Type3 font must start with the d0 operator or the d1 operator.
During the glyph parsing, "d0" and "d1" are interpreted as "d" operator due to the readOperator method in the PDFStreamParser.
In attachment, you can find a patch proposal to fix this problem.
Regards,
Eric
