Summary:
PDObjectReference getReferencedObject() returns null if referenced obj is not a COSStream
Description:
When creating a pdf I am setting a PDAnnotation as the referenced object of a PDObjectReference using setReferencedObject.
When I subsequently load the same document and then call getReferencedObject on the PDObjectReference, null is returned. This is because an exception is thrown in PDXObject.createXObject (called inside getReferencedObject) as the referenced object is not a COSStream, just a COSDictionary.
