I use the class TextToPDF for create a PDF Document
from a text file. That operates correctly with a simply
text. But when i use german umlauts in the text like
Ã¤,Ã¶,Ã¼ or Ã the PDF Document cut this letters.
Attached is a sample document contaning four words with
incorrectly umlauts!

To the anonymous poster, did you mean for both PDF links to be the same?

For PDF file, which contains accented Latin1
characters:
http://acl.ldc.upenn.edu//P/P06/P06-2052.pdf
I get a u with umlauts converted into "currency1u"
(look at the first name on the first page).
For the following file containing Japanese characters:
http://acl.ldc.upenn.edu//P/P06/P06-2052.pdf
I get error:
java.io.IOException: Unknown encoding for 'H'
I also can't seem to cut and past the form.
