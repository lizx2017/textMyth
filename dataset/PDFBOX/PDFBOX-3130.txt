Summary:
Recent regression in PDFTextStripper, text getting garbled
Description:
Text extraction using PrintTextLocations is getting garbled characters in the attached snippet.
For this file it is getting one string of "2O(Er4env vqeheurosriAurseirueeass ss/Ct:7:rh adaliaargynse csr eadc+cit6e l1ipc te+2en 6d9c1)9e 91 2933"
This test case is about as small as I could make it and still show the problem; when I reduced the file to just one line of text, then the text came though correctly.
This problem shows up in RC2 and the latest development build. I believe it was OK in the development build from Nov 4
