Summary:
Decomposed extended Latin Characters not normalized
Description:
03_2_SSL.pdf file has the unicode U+00a8 character which when extracted does not get placed over the previous character. U+0308 is required to do this. This issue applies to most diacritics found in PDF files since pdf writers use the non-combining forms of the diacritics instead of the combining forms. This issue also applies to two files located in the regression test. These are Garcia2004_thesis.pdf and cweb.pdf.
