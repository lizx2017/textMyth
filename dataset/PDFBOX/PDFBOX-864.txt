Summary:
Incorrect cropping from PDFToImage with offset mediaBox
Description:
When the mediaBox is not at 0,0 then incorrect image is created.
The attached file shows the problem.
Note: While the PDFBox creates the image from the mediaBox, the Adobe Reader seems to use the cropBox. That seems like the easiest fix here.
