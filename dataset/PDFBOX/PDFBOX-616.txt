Summary:
Invalid Images Returned
Description:
When getting images from a PDF document using PDXObjectImage (code fragment below), it returns an image with invalid characteristics. The PDXObjectImage is not null, but attributes like .getColorSpace() return null. The image has a height and width, but the getRGBImage() method returns null.
This happens on EVERY image of the attached file. Code fragment and output is shown below.
If I use the write2file() method of PDXObjectImage to write out the image to a fil, then I get a valid image. (At least, it displays fine.)
Code Fragment:
// Get a list of pages from the input PDF document
List pages = InputDoc.getDocumentCatalog().getAllPages();
// Process each page
int i = 0;
for (Object obj : pages)
{
String Barcode = null;
i++;
PDPage page = (PDPage)obj;
// Get the image on the page and process it
PDResources resources = page.getResources();
Map images = resources.getImages();
System.out.println("Found " + images.size() + " images on Page " + i);
if( images != null )
{
Iterator imageIter = images.keySet().iterator();
while ( imageIter.hasNext() )
{
String key = (String)imageIter.next();
System.out.println("key = " + key);
PDXObjectImage image = (PDXObjectImage)images.get( key );
if (image != null)
{ System.out.println("Image subtype = " + image.SUB_TYPE.toString()); System.out.println("Image suffix = " + image.getSuffix()); System.out.println("PDX image has height = " + image.getHeight() + " and width " + image.getWidth()); // Convert image to a Buffered Image, so we can // look for a barcode and decode it BufferedImage RGBimage = image.getRGBImage(); if (RGBimage == null) System.out.println("RGBimage is null"); }
}
}
