Summary:
Incorrect transform for annotations / appearance streams
Description:
The attached file (from the ghostscript installation) doesn't render properly, especially page 3, where the images are about double the size. The cause is that the transform for the appearance stream must be calculated based on the BBox and the appearance rectangle and the matrix (if available). This is described in "Algorithm: Appearance streams" in the "Appearance Streams" section of the spec.
I have already prepared a fix, which I will commit after PDFBOX-2262.
Update: this issue is also about signatures and acroform fields, because these have also appearance streams that are rendered with the same code.
