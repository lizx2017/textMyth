Summary:
Reusing PDFonts causing COSVisitorException.
Description:
I try to reuse custom fonts and cache the PDFont objects in a ConcurrentHashMap. But when I try to reuse those fonts, I get a
org.apache.pdfbox.exceptions.COSVisitorException: Das Handle ist ung√ºltig
PDTrueTypeFont.loadTTF() has a PDDocument as the first parameter. So I guess, the font is somehow linked with the font and reusing such a font for another PDDocument causing this exception .
When processing multiple documents with the very same fonts, those TTF fonts get loaded over and over again from the system. Why is the font linked with the document? Would it be possible to make PDFont independent from PDDocument (why not)?
