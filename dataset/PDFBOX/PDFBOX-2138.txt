Summary:
Corrupted words when using PDFTextStripper
Description:
>> I am using PDFTextStripper (embedded into another application) to get
>> the raw text of PDFs so far with good results but recently a PDF file
>> has appeared where the output of the PDFTextStripper was corrupted. I
>> got sentences like:
>>
>>
>>
>> "There is al o con ern that b nkers may be pushed to misprice risk
>> (No. 6) by the pres ures of c mpetition and an abunda ce of central b
>> nk-provided liquidity."
> Additionally some portions of text appear
> twice in the output: first correctly and then corrupted. I have
> attached an output created with PDFBox's command line options.
> If you compare lines 357- 365 with lines 421-429 you see that it is
> the same paragraph, first ok and then with characters missing. In the
> original source this paragraph is unique.
> The same seems to happen for the other instances where text is corrupted.
I also tried it directly on the command line with the same results: input and output files are attached.
