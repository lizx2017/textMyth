PDPage.convertToImage() fails to work correctly.
Attached are two documents that illustrate failures.
1) mtxfidelity.pdf is a file that has the text appear
but the layout is incorrect.

I would love to use this library for this use only. If this
class and method worked (seems to work ok on 1/3 of many
pdfs I have tested) I would be very happy, and would most
likey be filling out a donation form.
