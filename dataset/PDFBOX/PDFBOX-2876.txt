Summary:
Better support for embedding of simple TrueType fonts
Description:
PDTrueType font no longer has any non-deprecated methods which support embedding. This is because PDType0Font provides a much better user experience, as Unicode support is usually expected.
However, there are cases where its useful to have simple TrueType embedding but the current code assumes WinAnsiEncoding. Seeing as simple fonts are always tied to an Encoding, I'm going to add a new constructor load(document, inputStream, encoding), which makes this explicit, and will break our reliance on WinAnsiEncoding.
