Summary:
Syntax error in DOAP file release section
Description:
DOAP files can contain details of multiple release Versions, however each must be listed in a separate release section, for example:
<release>
      <Version>
        <name>Apache XYZ</name>
        <created>2015-02-16</created>
        <revision>1.6.2</revision>
      </Version>
</release>
<release>
      <Version>
        <name>Apache XYZ</name>
        <created>2014-09-24</created>
        <revision>1.6.1</revision>
      </Version>
</release>
Please can the project DOAP be corrected accordingly?
Thanks.
