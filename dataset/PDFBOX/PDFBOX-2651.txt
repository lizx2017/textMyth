Summary:
Preflight doesn't check for valid destination syntax
Description:
This is sortof a followup on PDFBOX-2612. While working on that one, I noticed that preflight doesn't check for a valid 2nd parameter in the destination. In other words, the fix in PDFBOX-2612 helps to pass the Bavaria test, but we're not really doing ALL that needs to be done, i.e. check against what's mentioned in "TABLE 8.2 Destination syntax".
To be sure, I tested the file rolfs_diss_A1b.pdf with this change with the online check of PDF-Tools:
<</D[406 0 R/FxtH 664]/S/GoTo>>
It should be /FitH, and PDF-Tools flags the error. So should we.
