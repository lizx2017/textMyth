Summary:
NonSequentialParser does not tolerate missing %%EOF markers
Description:
The NonSequentialParser throws an exception when parsing a file with a missing or corrupted %%EOF marker. All PDF-viewers I tried however handle this kind of documents without problems.
The attached patch makes the parser ignore missing %%EOF when in lenient mode. I cannot attach the original file presenting this problem, since it is a bank statement, but I have attached a small document with the same issue that I have created for testing.
