Summary:
Revocation CRL check should be done at signing time in AddValidation example
Description:
crl.isRevoked(cert) in CRLHelper.java is not correct, a certificate could have been valid at signing time and be invalidated later, e.g. when an employee signs, but loses his card at the after-signing-party. The correct way to do it is in CRLVerifier.verifyCertificateCRLs().
