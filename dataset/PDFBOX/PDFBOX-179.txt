Hi all,
I'm trying to use PdfBox, and I've no problem to say
it's very simple to use and powerful to manage pdf
files. But there is a function I can't do (however
probably it's because I don't understand all
application features): I'm trying to merge document,
but the merge operation is been just on pdf pages...
I try to be clearer with an example :
PDF 1 -> just a page with a string "This is"
PDF 2 -> just a page with a string "an example"
I'm able to make a marge, but the destination
document'll be composite of 2 pages, the first with
the string "This is" (and all the other page size is
blank) and the second one with the message "an
example".
What I need is the resulted document'll be a pdf with
just one page, with the message "This is" and just
below "an example". Practically, not to consider the
blank section of the page 1, and append the page
2'text after page 1's one.
It's possible ? Or in order to do this it's necessary
a new release ?
Thanks a lot
Regards
Simone
