Summary:
FDFDictionary parses fields in XFDF incorrectly
Description:
FDFDictionary finds "fields" tag and then parses all of it's descendants which tag name is "field". But that is wrong, because only direct children of "fields" tag should be handled by FDFDictionary. All the other fields are handled recursively by FDFField constructor.
