Summary:
Color map not correctly copied when PDF file is split
Description:
A customer has a pdf file which we split (pdfbox.util.Splitter) for inclusion in a document. When I split the file using the PDFSplit tool, the same problem occurs.
On some pages, the color map appears to be altered such that background and text are rendered in different colors (yellow/lilac instead of white/blackish). The PDF the customer supplies is probably a scanned document but the metadata claims it is created using PDF-XChange Viewer 2.5.195.0.
The odd thing is that only a subset of pages are affected in a consistent fashion.
I can supply the original PDF file on request for you to look at.
