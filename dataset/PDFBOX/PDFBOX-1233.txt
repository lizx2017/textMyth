Summary:
CCITTFaxG31DDecodeInputStream - Extended codes have wrong length
Description:
When dealing with large fax images there are Extended Make Up Codes.
They are added to the tree as ...
buildUpMakeUp(LONG_MAKE_UP, WHITE_LOOKUP_TREE_ROOT);
buildUpMakeUp(LONG_MAKE_UP, BLACK_LOOKUP_TREE_ROOT);
Accept, the length is 0 based not starting at 1792.
The quick hack is to create a new method so the length of the node is correct
private static void buildUpMakeUpLong(short[] codes,
NonLeafLookupTreeNode root)
{
for (int len = 0, c = codes.length; len < c; len++)
{ LookupTreeNode leaf = new MakeUpTreeNode((len + 28) * 64); addLookupTreeNode(codes[len], root, leaf); }
}
as thus ...
buildUpMakeUpLong(LONG_MAKE_UP, WHITE_LOOKUP_TREE_ROOT);
buildUpMakeUpLong(LONG_MAKE_UP, BLACK_LOOKUP_TREE_ROOT);
