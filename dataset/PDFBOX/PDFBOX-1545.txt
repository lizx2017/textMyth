Summary:
ReplaceString fails to replace text, however RemoveText or TextExtraction works fine
Description:
org.apache.pdfbox.examples.pdmodel.ReplaceString do not replaces any strings in this pdf :
https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B4SxNalgkoJ3VjRDTEN0VER6WGc/edit?usp=sharing
(anyone with link can view and download it...)
As i found during iteration in "Tj" and "tj" operations :
COSString previous = (COSString)tokens.get( j-1 );
String string = previous.getString();
Those strings are just empty or with length of 2 (some whitespaces only) ... i would expect to get some separated group of words from my PDF.
I tried this on version 1.7.1 and then i download latest code from SVN (today) and both version had the same behaviour. I my PDF special in any way or which objects should be explored next ? I tried another two PDF downloaded from google drive and both had the same issue (maybe google formats PDF in special way ?).
I am suprised that RemoveText works fine in this PDF and also test extraction give me good result - so there must be a way... Thank you
PS: I don`t mind to fix bug on my own it but i do not have any significant knowledge of internal PDF structure. Hints welcomed.
