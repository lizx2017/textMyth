Summary:
NonSequentialPDFParser does not set security handler for access check
Description:
While NonSequentialPDFParser uses SecurityHandler for decryption and also provides a method to get the handler it does not assign it to generated PDDocument thus classes without access to parser object cannot retrieve access permissions.
In this issue the necessary changes to NonSequentialPDFParser, PDDocument and tools using it will be collected.
