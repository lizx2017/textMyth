Summary:
[patch] maven build errors in current trunk
Description:
I just tried building pdfbox from the current trunk, and it failed:
the dependencies (fontbox / jempbox) have an inconsitent version numbering. Fixed in attached diff
some libraries are references as org.fontbox / org.jempbox. Fixed in attached diff
Some JUnit tests fail, I'll investigate this later.
