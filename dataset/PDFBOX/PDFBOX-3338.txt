Summary:
CCITT Fax decoder fails
Description:
I have a PDF which does not render in PDFBox. It contains pages from a scanner, encoded as CCITT Fax Tiffs. On each page, the decoder always runs into IOException("TIFFFaxDecoder: EOL encountered in black run.") (or the same message just with "white" instead of "black"). Unfortunately, the PDF contains sensitive data and I cannot share it.
As a test, I have replaced the TIFFFaxDecoder by the class CCITTFaxDecoderStream from the Twelve Monkeys ImageIO library. All worked fine after that and PDFToImage produced the expected result.
I have extracted the first few bytes of the TIFF to show the problem without sharing the confidential content. See the attached test program and test file.
I have tested this against latest trunk version of PDFBox, but I think the decoder implementation is basically the same in all versions.
