Summary:
FileSystemFontProvider cache instability
Description:
FileSystemFontProvider uses Java's Preferences API to cache font metadata, however it doesn't seem to work out of the box on Windows (due to file permissions) and one user on the mailing list has complained that on Linux file paths with more than 80 characters can't be handed. Serializable is also slow.
It looks like Preferences wasn't a good choice here. We're going to need to roll our own cache file format and save it somewhere we have write access to.
