I've got a PDF-file with a strange encoding. When I use
ExtractText it gives me lines of
MT73MT110MT102MT111MT45MT66....
I tried to use other extracting tools like pdftohtml
and it could extract the text in plain English.
Maybe I'm just doing something wrong with the encoding
but I tried different things and could't extract the
right text.

Hello,
I have found more files which are strange encoded but e.g.
can be extracted by Adobe. I though it might have to do with
the Font. All of these files don't provide a BaseFont and I
think it might be because maybe this files were created on
Unix systems. Maybe if somehow the font can be provided or
someone can find out which font is used one can find out how
to decode the text.

I have got exactly the same problem. I registred a bug (ID
1250097) and asked a question in the forum at the begining
of August under the title : "Text Extraction unsuccessful with
PDFBox". Unfortunately, I haven't got any solution yet.
If you find a way to solve this problem, i am interested in ...
Thanks
