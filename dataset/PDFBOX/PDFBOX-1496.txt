Summary:
Can't add multiple form XObjects to a PDF - they become duplicated
Description:
I've been trying to paste multiple small PDFs into a big one as form XObjects. This image illustrates what I'm trying to do:

The Test 1-3 boxes would be the little PDFs I want to insert. When I try to do this, I get this result:

The last form to be pasted is just duplicated three times. It seems that instead of adding multiple XObjects, I am just adding multiple references to a single XObject, and whenever I try to add another XObject it just overwrites the XObject that the form instances were referring to. It seems I can't insert multiple forms, just multiple references to a single one.
