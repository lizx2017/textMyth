Pdfbox does not detect the paper format of the PDF. It
always says "Orientation 1" even after changing it from
java:
document.getPageFormat(0).setOrientation(PageFormat.LANDSCAPE);
and alternates between "Height 595.0, Width 842.0" and
"Height 842.0, Width 595.0" (which both is A1 if
interpreted as mm)
I tried several PDF-Creators (itext, Openoffice), but
the Pdfbox always wants to print LETTER in PORTRAIT
orientation. (the pages are A4)
Settings the orientation in the printer dialog does not
help.
I believe it get's its info from:
/Rotate 90/MediaBox[0 0 595 842]
