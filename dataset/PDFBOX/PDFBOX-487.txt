Summary:
Font size not rendered with the needed precision
Description:
When previewing the attached file using the PDFReader, the font size is not correct. The last paragraph (the one with the huge hex string that is split over several lines) should be exactly as long as the
separator lines. See how the font size changes if the preview is resized, leaving a wider or narrower margin at the end of the page.
This can be solved by adding
graphics.setRenderingHint(RenderingHints.KEY_FRACTIONALMETRICS, RenderingHints.VALUE_FRACTIONALMETRICS_ON);
to the drawPage method of the PageDrawer. After applying the change, always fits the page exactly, independent of the preview window size.
