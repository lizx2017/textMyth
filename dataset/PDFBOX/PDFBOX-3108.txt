Summary:
Font cache is always rebuilt when font skipped
Description:
If a font is skipped because of a missing name, the font is not added to the fontInfoList. This means that at the next program start, the list will be rebuilt.
This has happened for me all the time, I'm just too patient so I didn't realize the problem. It happens with the attached font, which is on my system.
There should be a type of entry in the cache file that mentions a file, but no font name, so that the next time the font directories are looked into, that file is not considered to be a new font.
