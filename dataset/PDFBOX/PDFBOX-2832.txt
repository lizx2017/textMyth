Summary:
Remove obsolete methods from fontbox's Encoding
Description:
FontBox's Encoding class contains some obsolete static methods which always return null. Note that it's not possible to have a correct implementation of these methods as part of an Encoding, because they require knowledge of characters, which actually requires a GlyphList + Encoding, so the removed code was never correct.
