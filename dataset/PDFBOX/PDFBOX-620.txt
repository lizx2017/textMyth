Summary:
Text extract fails on some PDF files but not others...
Description:
Having the same problem with 0.7.3, 0.7.4-dev and 0.8.0 - in 0.7.3 I get text with nulls, e.g. "Dermoapo made 'interactive updates' a key part onullits stratenull nullr launnull chinnulla new skincare rannull in a competitive market. nulle resultnullIncreased sales nullr pharmacies that used the updates." while in 0.8.0 it appears as "Dermoapo made 'interactive updates' a key part o?its strate? ?r laun?
chin?a new skincare ran? in a competitive market. ?e result?Increased
sales ?r pharmacies that used the updates."
Maybe this is a font problem? Or encoding? I debugged the code in PDFTextStripper and and these appear in the charactersByArticle field even before normalization.
In 0.8.0 I get some info logs from the engine:
