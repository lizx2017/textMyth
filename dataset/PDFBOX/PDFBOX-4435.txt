Summary:
Poor quality printing of PDF label
Description:
Hello,
I'm experiencing poor quality printing of PDF courier labels with PDFBox when printing from the command line with the following command:
java -jar pdfbox-app-*.jar PrintPDF label.pdf
This makes scanning the QR code on these labels troublesome.
I've tried versions 2.0.3, 2.0.13, 2.0.14 (SNAPSHOT) and all produce the same quality issue. Interestingly version 1.8.16 does not appear to suffer from this issue.
I have tried 2 different thermal printers, a GK420d and a CITIZEN CL-S400DT(Z) and both output the same.
When printing the label directly from the GNOME document viewer (Evince) the label prints clearly on both printers.
Please find examples of these labels attached.
Can anything be done to prevent these quality issues?
Thanks,
David
