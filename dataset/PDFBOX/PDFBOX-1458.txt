Summary:
wasted work in PDOptionalContentProperties.setGroupEnabled()
Description:
The problem appears in version version 1.7.1 and in revision 1414788.
I attached a three-line patch (on.diff) that fixes it. This problem
and the attached patch are similar the previously fixed PDFBOX-1447
and its patch.
In method "PDOptionalContentProperties.setGroupEnabled", the loop over
"on" should not be executed if "enable" is "true". When "enable" is
"true", all the iterations just compute "group" and "name", and then
discard them, because the "if" condition depends on "!enable".
Similarly, in the same method
"PDOptionalContentProperties.setGroupEnabled", the loop over "off"
should not be executed if "enable" is "false". I attached a separate
patch (off.diff) for the "off" loop.
