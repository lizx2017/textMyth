Summary:
Wrong widthOfSpace
Description:
For some TextPositions in this particular PDF (after being processed with PDFStreamEngine), the getWidthOfSpace method returns 0.
I've traced the bug to `processEncodedText` in `PDFStreamEngine`: when `spaceWidthText` is converted to display units, `textMatrix.getValue(0,0)` returns 0. Being a factor in the conversion expression, sets the result to 0.
float spaceWidthDisp = spaceWidthText * fontSizeText * horizontalScalingText * textMatrix.getValue(0, 0)
ctm.getValue(0, 0);
The conversion is correct if that factor is removed from the expression.
