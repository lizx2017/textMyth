Summary:
Incomplete signature creation (regression in 1.8.3 with PDFBOX-1780)
Description:
I got a document, which do not look special but after the PDFBOX-1780 patch, signing breaks and only a small footprint was written into the document.
The changes made with the patch PDFBOX-1780 in the COSWriter, cause this problem for me.
