Summary:
[Patch] CCITTFactory.createFromFile methods do not release lock on source file
Description:
When using CCITTFactory.createFromFile methods, a RandomAccessFile is created on the source file, but never closed.
On Windows, this locks the file. I haven't had the time yet to test on Linux.
I have prepared a patch in GitHub, will post as soon as it's pushed.
