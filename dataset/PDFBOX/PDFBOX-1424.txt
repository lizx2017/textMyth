Summary:
Wrong glyph (Persian) is used in extacted text instead of the original glyph (Persian) in PDF file
Description:
Hi
I am very new to PDFBox and I am dealing with Persian PDF files. When I convert Persian PDF files using PDFBox-app, some Persian glyphs like م are displayed wrongly in the extracted text. For example, the word "هستم" in Persian is extracted as "هستن" and "من" in Persian is extracted as "هن". Also, the word "سلام" is extracted as "سالم". By the way, I have tested extracting text from a complete Persian PDF file with multiple pages; the result is disappointing. Actually, it is totally wrong. Please let me know if I should upload an example Persian PDF file.
