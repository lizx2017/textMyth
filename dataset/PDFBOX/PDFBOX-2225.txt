Summary:
ClassCastException in PDFMergerUtility.appendDocument
Description:
Edit: Problem confirmed to exist in 1.8.1 and 1.8.6
The following exception will occur if any type of Exception other than IOException is thrown within a particular try-catch in PDFMergerUtility.appendDocument:
java.lang.ClassCastException: java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException cannot be cast to java.io.IOException
For the version I am using (1.8.1), the problem occurs on line 294
The problem is that the author mistakenly assumed that the only exception which could be caught was IOException. I recommend that the cast be removed, and that either the additional checked exceptions be thrown by appendDocument or wrapped with an unchecked exception
Also, anyone seeing this may want to investigate why an IndexOutOfBoundsException is occurring here, though this is obviously a separate issue
