Summary:
Problem in extracting roman page numbers [PDPageLabels.java]
Description:
Hi all ,
I am very long time user of PDFBOX from 0.7.3 version.
Current I am using the latest version(1.2.1).
While using i came across the problem while extracting PDFPageLabels for PDF with roman numbers .
For example if the label is "xi" PDFBOX output is "xxi" and it is correct for pagenumber less than ten.
I made a small correction in the code PDPageLabels.java and found that it seems to work fine .
ORIGINAL CODE IN PDPageLabels.java
private static final String[][] ROMANS = new String[][]
{
{ "", "i", "ii", "iii", "iv", "v", "vi", "vii", "viii", "ix" },
{ "x", "xx", "xxx", "xl", "l", "lx", "lxx", "lxxx", "xc" },
{ "c", "cc", "ccc", "cd", "d", "dc", "dcc", "dccc", "cm" }, };


MODIFIED CODE IN PDPageLabels.java


private static final String[][] ROMANS = new String[][]
{
{ "", "i", "ii", "iii", "iv", "v", "vi", "vii", "viii", "ix" }
,
{ "", "x", "xx", "xxx", "xl", "l", "lx", "lxx", "lxxx", "xc" }
,
{ "", "c", "cc", "ccc", "cd", "d", "dc", "dcc", "dccc", "cm" }
, };
*Please advice me whether the above change is correct and incorporate in my PDFBox.
Thank You very much
