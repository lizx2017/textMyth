Summary:
PrintImageLocations does not print information of all images
Description:
Hi,
PrintImageLocations does not print information of all images.
However I am able to extract all images using "ExtractImages.java"
Following is my initial analysis:
In processResources method of ExtractImages.java, source code is present as given below
if( xobjects != null )
{
Iterator<String> xobjectIter = xobjects.keySet().iterator();
while( xobjectIter.hasNext() )
{
if (xobject instanceof PDXObjectImage)
{ ---- ---- }
else if (xobject instanceof PDXObjectForm)
{ PDXObjectForm xObjectForm = (PDXObjectForm)xobject; PDResources formResources = xObjectForm.getResources(); processResources(formResources, prefix, addKey); }
}
}
My PDF contains some images which are of type PDXObjectForm.
I am not able to get information of all those images (of type PDXObjectForm) using PrintImageLocations.java
In processOperator method of PrintImageLocations.java, there is no "else" statement for images of type PDXObjectForm. Is this problem?
Kindly help and suggest how to fix this.
