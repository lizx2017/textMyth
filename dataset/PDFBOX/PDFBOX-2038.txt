Summary:
Method VisualSignatureParser#parse does not close COSDocument
Description:
I am adding a visual signature to my PDF.
SignatureOptions options = new SignatureOptions();
options.setVisualSignature( new FileInputStream("my.jpg") );
After a while I am getting the following warning in logs:
Warning: COSDocument: You did not close a PDF Document
The problem cause is probably the method org.apache.pdfbox.pdfparser.VisualSignatureParser#parse which creates instance of COSDocument, but does not close it.
