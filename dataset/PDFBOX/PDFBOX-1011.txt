Summary:
Incorrect metadata for encrypted PDFs with non-ASCII characters
Description:
I have a document which has Author metadata = "Jırg Boettger". That second character is not an 'i', it is a dotless lower case i.
It is also an encrypted pdf, with user password = "".
The problem is that if I load the document, decrypt it and then try to examine the document-level metadata (such as author) I see problems with the non-ASCII chars.
I will attach a testcase & the sample PDF that reproduces the problem for me.
A bit of detail that may be useful: COSObject 19 0 at the end of the PDF defines the Author. It is represented as byte[] = {-95, -118, -50, 122, -127, 105, 53, 105, 50, 14, -27, 122, 120}
SecurityHandler.encryptData() line 223 - which decrypts the string gives: J?rg Boettger. bytes = [74, -102, 114, 103, 32, 66, 111, 101, 116, 116, 103, 101, 114]
Note the -102 in the second character.
The second character, whose byte-value is -102 is not a displayable ASCII char (even at 256 -102 = 154) and it just gets dropped from the COSString & so we get an author of Jrg Boettger from PDDocumentInformation.
I'm not sure what the requirements are for handling non-ASCII chars in this situation. But Adobe Reader 9, 10 & Mac OS X's Preview application all show the correct author value.
