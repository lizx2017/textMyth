Summary:
RandomAccessBuffer clone is broken for non-default chunk size
Description:
When RandomAccessBuffer is initialized with an array it uses the array length as chunkSize. This is not respected by RandomAccessBuffer.clone which sets default length chunkSize but generates cloned buffers in the source chunkSize length. Thus a corrupt clone is created.
