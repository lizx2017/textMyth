Summary:
pdfMerger App produces Garbage
Description:
pdfbox Utility pdfMerger produces a merged document containing garbage. All merged pdf files are contained but Strings are destroyed.
The source pdf files are created with graphviz and are readable without error or disturbance both with Acrobat X and pdfbox pdfDebug Utility.
Another astounding thing is that a handcoded merger using pdfMergerUtility class works fine when run within Eclipse Juno and creates same garbage when run from cmd line (pls. see attached source PdfRenderer.java)
I checked everything that comes in mind to find the differences, e.g. Java version, encoding/codepage issues, memory settings, found nothing.
