Summary:
LAB color space produces wrong colors
Description:
The attached example uses LAB colors. When rendering it using PDFToImage, the result is kind of violet, instead of black text and yellow rectangles (see the attached jpeg).
When comparing 1.8 sources with current trunk, the incoming values are "scaled to range" in trunk PDLab#toRGB(), while this was not the case in 1.8 PDColorState and ColorSpaceLab. As far as I can tell, in 1.8 the values were only "clipped to range" in ColorSpaceLab#toCIEXYZ().
If I remove the scaling in 2.0 the rendering is correct.
