Summary:
Long rendering time
Description:
Attached pdf file takes too long (more then 9 secs) to render in PDFDebugger (this is a simplified version of a real life pdf that I can not publish for privacy reasons, it takes 57 seconds to render and it contains 56 images and some text).
I have tried with the options provided in https://pdfbox.apache.org/2.0/getting-started.html but performance is the same
