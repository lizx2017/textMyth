Summary:
Creating a link without borders appears with borders in Mac's Preview
Description:
I am trying to create a link with no borders. The link appears and works perfect in Adobe reader, but in Mac Preview the link appears with a border around it. Here is my code :
PDAnnotationLink link = new PDAnnotationLink();
PDBorderStyleDictionary border = new PDBorderStyleDictionary();
border.setWidth( 0f );
link.setBorderStyle( border );
Can this be fixed to show no border in Mac's Preview ?
I have attached a sample PDF with a link in its last page ... You can test it on Adobe reader and Mac's Preview programs.
