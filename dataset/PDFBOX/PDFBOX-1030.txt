Summary:
COSWriter.visitFromStream() does not close InputStream.
Description:
We use pdfbox inside apache-karaf to write complex PDF files.
Therefore we are including several COSStreams in the PDF file to be written. Some of the COSStream's use a scratch file for storing the stream content.
Inspecting the open files of my apache-karaf unveiled, that these scratch files a still open after writing the PDDocument and closing it.
Therefore I inspected the code inside COSWriter.visitFromStream(COSStream) and found out, the the InputStream name 'input' opened right at the beginning is never closed.
Please add a finally-clause, which robustely closes this input stream.
I inspected pdfbox-1.4.0 and the current SVN revision under
http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/pdfbox/trunk/pdfbox/src/main/java/org/apache/pdfbox/pdfwriter/COSWriter.java?revision=1092855&view=markup
I would be very nice, if this issue could be fixed before pdfbox-1.6.0
TIA and best regards, Wolfgang
