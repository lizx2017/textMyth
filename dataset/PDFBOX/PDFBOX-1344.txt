Summary:
xml namespace problem in ResourceRef
Description:
Working on xmpbox and jempbox, I encountered a problem with ResourceRef in jempbox
The attached example fails with current version of jempbox
Reading dom.Element javadoc, I understand that is because le namespaceURI is not good. Changing it to the expected constants fixes the problem.
But I am not sure, I understand all the problem... So if someone has 5 minuts to look at it and comment that issue to validate or invalidate the patch ... let do it.
The patch is really short.
Thanks
