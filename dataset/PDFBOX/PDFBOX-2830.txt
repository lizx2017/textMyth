Summary:
Can't draw color border around a PDTextBox + create example
Description:
There's a thread "Setting a border color on a PDTextBox" in the user mailing list. This relates to version 1.8.*, but I wanted to create an example for 2.0. After doing this for 2.0 with this code
PDAppearanceCharacteristicsDictionary fieldAppearance = 
                new PDAppearanceCharacteristicsDictionary(new COSDictionary());
        PDColor green = new PDColor(new float[] { 0, 1, 0 }, PDDeviceRGB.INSTANCE);
        fieldAppearance.setBorderColour(green);
        widget.setAppearanceCharacteristics(fieldAppearance);
it didn't work. The reason is this in the PDF:
5 0 obj
<<
/FT /Tx
/T (SampleField)
/Type /Annot
/Subtype /Widget
/Rect [50.0 750.0 250.0 800.0]
/MK 7 0 R
/V (English form contents)
/AP 8 0 R
>>
endobj
6 0 obj
<<
/Font 9 0 R
>>
endobj
7 0 obj
<<
/BC [0.0 1.0 0.0 null]  <===================
>>
endobj
The /BC color array has an extra null element which comes from a "patternName" in PDColor:
    public COSArray toCOSArray()
    {
        COSArray array = new COSArray();
        array.setFloatArray(components);
        array.add(patternName);
        return array;
    }
Removing it in the PDF brings a "good" file. I believe this is a regression that came from changing PDGamma to PDColor some time ago in PDFBOX-2629.
