Summary:
Method PDDocument.getNumberOfPages() returns wrong number of pages
Description:
Hello,
I use PDFbox and are very pleased.
For one PDF file however getNumberOfPages() returns the wrong number of pages (1 instead of 2 pages).
Test code:
File xx = new File("c:\\temp
test.pdf");
PDDocument pdoc = PDDocument.load(xx);
int x = pdoc.getNumberOfPages();
The PDF file could be provided.
Thanks in advance.
Regards
