Hi, PDFBox is a great tool!
I'd like to request a simple enhancement to the code base if possible.
If you change the three lines below to call the get*Separator() method
the separators can be be made more dynamic by subclasses to allow
for separators to change within the document. For example line
separators could include line numbers.
Thanks,
Peter
