The "opt" tuple of a listbox/combobox is a COSArray.
The elements of the array are either a simple
COSString, or a COSArray of 2 COSStrings. (the latter
represents a listbox item and a value)
PDChoiceField.setValue assumes that the type of
EVERY element in the "opt" array matches the type of
the FIRST element in the "opt" array. This is not the
case. Based on how the PDF form field was
created, "opt" array contains a mix of both simple
COSString elements and compound COSArray
elements.
The setValue() code must be restructured to check the
type of each item in the "opt" array.
