Summary:
PDOutlineItem can not use the function getDestination() to get the PDPageDestination.
Description:
The getDestination() returns null. i found that ,if i want to get the destination,i must use the function getAction() to get the COSDictionary,then to get the destination array,then creat destination by my self.
So the function getDestination() just use for a Manual destination,this is trouble me!
