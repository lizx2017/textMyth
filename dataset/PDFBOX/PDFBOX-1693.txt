Description:
Hi everybody,
I have a problem with images extraction from PDF.
The images have rotated 90 degrees.
My code:
PDXObject xobject = xobjects.get(key);
PDXObjectImage image = null;
if (xobject instanceof PDXObjectImage) {
image = (PDXObjectImage) xobject;
image.write2file(outputPath);
}
Does anyone know what's the problem?
Thanks
