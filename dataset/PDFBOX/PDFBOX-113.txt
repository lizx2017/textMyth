The class PDAppearance.java contains a bug in function
convertToMultiLine. The line
"result.append(value.substring(lastIdx,currIdx));"
should be changed to
"result.append(line.substring(lastIdx,currIdx));" as
value may be null. This occurs when the
PDField.setValue method is called and there are
multiple lines (delimited by '\n') in the value.
