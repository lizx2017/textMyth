Summary:
NPE saving modified encrypted document
Description:
I posted this on the mailing list but got no answer. I'm describing here some behaviors that are triggering NPE when saving a modified pdf document.
What I'm trying to do is to open an encrypted document, modify it, save it back (I attached my test project). The three tests I made they all end up with a NPE but they work if I turn on setAllSecurityToBeRemoved (and I don't want security to be removed).
First test:
1- input is a doc encrypted with owner pwd having the modify permission on.
2- The document is loaded and decrypted using owner pwd.
3- permissions.isOwnerPermission() is true which is correct
4- permissions.canModify() is true which is correct
5- modify the doc and save throws a NPE which is NOT correct
Second test
1- input is a doc encrypted with owner pwd having the modify permission on.
2- The document is loaded but not decrypted
3- permissions.isOwnerPermission() is true, why? I didn't provide any owner pwd I should not have owner permissions.
4- permissions.canModify() is true which is correct
5- modify the doc and save throws a NPE which is NOT correct
Third test
1- input is a doc encrypted with owner pwd having NO permission.
2- The document is loaded and decrypted using owner pwd.
3- permissions.isOwnerPermission() is true which is correct
4- permissions.canModify() is true, why? I can modify the doc because I have owner permission but the Modify should be off.
5- modify the doc and save throws a NPE which is NOT correct
