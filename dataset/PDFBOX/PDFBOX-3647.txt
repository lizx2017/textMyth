Summary:
Shading cut off
Description:
The attached file is reduced from file "***417" that I mentioned in PDFBOX-3000. The shading is all black (type 0 function that is all black). It is cut off in rendering by PDFBox. This is somehow related to the BBox and to the cm operation before the sh. Changing them changes the cutoff.
