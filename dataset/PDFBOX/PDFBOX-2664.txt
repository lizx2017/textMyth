Summary:
PDDocumentInformation shouldn't throw IOException
Description:
As part of PDFBOX-1803 the DateConverter.toCalendar doesn't throw IOException anymore. This is correctly reflected in the COSDictionary.getDate but not in the PDDocumentInformation.getCreationDate and getCreationDate.getModificationDate which are forcing the user to surround with a try/catch for an exception that is never thrown.
