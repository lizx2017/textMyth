Summary:
Unicode text getting mangled via TextToPDF + PDFTextStripper
Description:
I'm trying to round trip some text through PDFBox, but I'm finding that along the way unicode text is getting mangled and coming back as the wrong characters.
The process I'm following is to use TextToPDF to generate a PDF, then reading it back in again with PDFTextStripper. I'm not sure if the problem is coming about during generation or reading yet, but I've a nasty feeling there might be an issue with both. (I've seen issues with code that does one part of the other)
Attached is a unit test written against trunk. It creates a series of Reader objects based on both ASCII and non-ASCII text, creates a PDF using TextToPDF, then compares the text. It includes a test that verifies that the corruption isn't caused by the readers, and another that fails showing that the text was corrupted by the roundtrip.
Ideally the test would also look in the dictionary to check what was stored there, but I don't know enough about the file format to manage that. Will hopefully look into that shortly though.
