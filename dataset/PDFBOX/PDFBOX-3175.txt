Summary:
PDFTextStreamEngine probably miscalculates text height
Description:
When parsing a PDF document, TextPosition is created with constant text height, about 2 time smaller than character width, regardless of font size.
The following workaround to calculate dyDisplay fixes the issue:
float verticalScaling = 1/1000f;
if (font instanceof PDType3Font)
{ Matrix fontMatrix = font.getFontMatrix(); verticalScaling = fontMatrix.getValue(1, 1); }
float dyDisplay = bbox.getHeight() * fontSize * verticalScaling;
