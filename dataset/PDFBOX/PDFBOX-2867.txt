Summary:
Correct use of Float.NaN
Description:
replace
wordSpacing == Float.NaN
with
Float.isNaN(wordSpacing)
because wordSpacing == Float.NaN is always false.
A test by Tim Allison showed 9 differences in TIKA (but "None of the differences were actual words. "), and no difference in a manual test with ExtractText.
