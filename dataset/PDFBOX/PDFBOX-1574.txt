Summary:
ImportFDF fails to do anything
Description:
I created a dead-simple PDF with form fields in Acrobat and generated an FDF file from it.
Tried to run ImportFDF on these files and the resulting file is totally blank.
Attached are the input files (1.pdf, 1_data.fdf), the result file (2.pdf) and the warnings ImportFDF generated.
