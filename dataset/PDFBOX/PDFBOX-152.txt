When I merge a Landscape PDF with a Portrait PDF the
orientation of all the pages in the result is the same
as whichever PDF was first. For instance,
PDFMerger landscape.pdf portrait.pdf test.pdf
results in all pages in test.pdf in landscape format.
I used the daily build of 0.7.3 but also tried
AppendDoc in 0.7.2 and got the same results.
Result attached.
Source files sent to FTP site.

I note that if I add the following lines to v1.1 of
PDFMergerUtility::appendDocument at line 315 (the section
creating the new pages), the orientation seems to be
corrected:
newPage.setCropBox( page.findCropBox() );
newPage.setMediaBox( page.findMediaBox() );
newPage.setRotation( page.findRotation() );
