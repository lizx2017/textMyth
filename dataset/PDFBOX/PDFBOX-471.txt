Summary:
invalid dictionary crashes parser
Description:
this is with svn version 774426
I am trying to parse an invalid xml document, with a dictionary of the form
/Producer (Virtual Print Engine PDF v1.0)
/CreationDate (D:20081120145900)
/Author (PowerGUI)
/Title (Document Title)
/Subject
/Creator (Some Creator)
Clearly, the /Subject dictionary value is invalid, but it would be nice if PDFBox didn't throw.
