Summary:
PDFBOX may not depend on plattform encoding
Description:
The pdf specification states, that PDFs use an ASCII compatible, 8 bit characterset.
PDFBOX uses on various places the plattform encoding to convert bytes from/to strings.
On JREs with an non ASCII compatible plattform encoding (there are such systems out there), this will break pdfbox.
