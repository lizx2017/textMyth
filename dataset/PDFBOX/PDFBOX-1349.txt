Summary:
Postscript tables of truetype fonts are not correctly parsed.
Description:
The specification of the 'post' table contains a list of 258 predefined character names.
However, the current fontbox interprets name indices <258 in terms of MacRomanEncoding, which is wrong.
Testcase and patch will be attached shortly.
