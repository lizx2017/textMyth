Summary:
PDPage.getAnnotations() modifies the PDF
Description:
I stumbled across this bug while using PDFDebugger.
PDPage.getAnnotations() writes to the Page's COSDictionary, adding a new Annots entry if it is missing.
This violates one of the rules which we introduced for 2.0, that reading from a PDF file should not result in the file's COS model being modified.
