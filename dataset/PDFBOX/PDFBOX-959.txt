Summary:
Text extraction slow and /tmp fills upwith AWT font files
Description:
During text extraction there is NO need to create AWT fonts.
However the current Type1C Font code creates the AWT always while initializing.
This has several really bad side effects:
1. Wasted time creating the AWT font.
2. The font files are copied into /tmp which fills up after a few thousand text extractions.
3. The AWT is created in a synchronized region so is single threaded.
The patch is quite simple. Just delay creation of the AWT fint until required.
