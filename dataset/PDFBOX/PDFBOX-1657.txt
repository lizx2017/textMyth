In class GlyphTable, method initData, contours are not set
if offset of glyph is the same as offset of previous glyph:
// don't repeat glyphs
if (currentOffset == offsets[i])
{ continue; }
Should be changed to:
// don't repeat glyphs
if (currentOffset == offsets[i])
{ glyphs[i] = glyphs[i-1]; continue; }
