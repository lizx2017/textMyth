Summary:
Greek Pdfs print out wrong characters
Description:
This issue resembles the PDFBOX-770 bug which was fixed in version 1.5.0, however in case of PDFBOX-770 problem occurred while extracting the text, in my case
I have the same problem but while printing (silent print).
E.G. in Greek PDF
a) Greek letter π is printed as pi. "προσώπων" would become "piροσώpiων" on paper.
b) The Greek letter μ is printed as µ ... which is slightly different on paper as the proper μ.
c) I think there is also an issue with Ω...but I will confirm this later.
As an example PDF ..the same pdf as in case of PDFBOX-770 can be used. Unfortunately I cannot post the results as results are on paper...
So, I cannot print any Greek PDF, as it comes out unreadable...
Please address the issue, a fix might be somehow similar to 770's fix..though I couldn't find any reference what was the problem then in a first place...
Thanks in advance...
P.K.
