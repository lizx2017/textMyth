Summary:
PDocumentCatalog.getAllPages returns empty list for certain pdfs, affects many other methods as well
Description:
Originally found from PageExtractor and after some debugging, it seems that PDocumentCatalot.getAllPages returns an empty list for certain pdfs. Also calling PDDocument.getNumberOfPages returns 0 as it uses the catalog for getting the actual information. This goes all the way down to COSDictionary.getDictionaryObject, which returns null for COSName.PAGES.
Eventually everything that has something do with page numbers fails. For example saving document to stream etc.
This problems occurs with certain pdf documents. I suspect they have some kind of different structure or header information or possibly even corrupted header. With other pdf files this problem does not exist. The non working pdf files are still accessible through other software like Adobe Reader and they work.
