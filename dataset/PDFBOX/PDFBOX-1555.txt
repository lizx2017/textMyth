Summary:
Javascript after %%EOF fails parsing
Description:
Hi
I was investigating a failure to parse and debugging the pdfbox code when I noticed in the PDF document that I can't forward at the end of the file this:
%%EOF^M
^M
^M
<script type="text/javascript">^M
var gaJsHost = (("https:" == document.location.protocol) ? "https://ssl." : "http://www.");^M
document.write(unescape("%3Cscript src='" + gaJsHost + "google-analytics.com/ga.js' type='text/javascript'%3E%3C/script%3E"));^M
</script>^M
<script type="text/javascript">^M
try {^M
var pageTracker = _gat._getTracker("UA-7429935-1");^M
pageTracker._trackPageview();^M
} catch(err) {}</script>^M
^M
^M
So the document ends.. but there is more content.. basically some javascript. What the parser does is it gets to
line 492 in org.apache.pdfbox.pdfparser.PDFParser
isEndOfFile get's set to true, but because it's not the end of the actual stream.. it continues this was a fix in PDFBOX-979.
Next time around in the loop it reads
<script type="text/javascript">
which I think it ignores.. then trys to read
var
twice as a number. Then blows up.. so I've playing around thinking of sensible thing to do. But worried that I might introduce some other issue. I assume this is legal structure for a PDFDocument. It opens fine in a viewer.
