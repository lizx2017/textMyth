Summary:
JavaDoc on website is marked as being in German
Description:
All Javadoc files on pdfbox.apache.org start with <html lang="de"> which makes some browsers wrongly assume the text is in German, and offer to translate it.  
Presumably this may cause some issues with search engine results when requesting only English results, though I have not personally experienced this. 
This is probably a minor/trivial issue. Could possibly be fixed explicitly setting the locale option in maven-javadoc-plugin, though I have not tested whether this does fix the issue.
