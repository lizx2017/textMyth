Summary:
Type 1 fonts are embedded incorrectly
Description:
When embedding a Type 1 font, the Widths array is invalid, because the codes are ordered based on the order of the named glyphs in the font file, instead of in encoding order.
Additionally, there's an NPE because no GlyphList is set for a newly embedded PDType1Font.
There's also no way to choose the encoding, it's always taken from the AFM file.
