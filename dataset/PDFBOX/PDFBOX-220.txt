We have a problem printing a PDF using PDFBox-0.7.3
Error we get is ( java.lang.RuntimeException: Not yet implemented ) after silentPrint() method. Our PDF contains croatian letters and jpeg pictures. If it can somehow help you we generate this document with Apache FOP. I attached a sample PDF.
Regards
Davor Siranovic
