Summary:
Performance regression in PDColorSpace#toRGBImageAWT
Description:
I've a private pdf containing 1900 tiny inline images (CMYK, 8bit) which renders way too slow. Again the CMYK2RGB conversion is the culprit here, BUT the known issue with the KCMS/LCMS change isn't the main problem here.
I ran some tests on linux (PDFToImage time -imageType png -resolution 150)
1.6.0_37: 355s
1.7.0_25: 289s
1.7.0_75: 298s
1.8.0_101: cancelled after 15 min
