Summary:
Glyph in type1CFont not rendered
Description:
The infinity symbol on page 3 of the file of PDFBOX-1770 is not rendered. I am attaching a "bad" and a "good" rendering. The "good" rendering was faked by removing the line
codeToName.put(key, encodingCodeToName.get(key));
in Type1Glyph2D. This helps keeping a "C121" in a map instead of being replaced with a "y". The font involved is the "KIJFMP+AdvTex2" font.
