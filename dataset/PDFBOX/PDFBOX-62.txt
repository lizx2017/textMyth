For certain PDF documents (such as the one attached)
the character/string widths (as obtained e.g. by the
PDFont.getStringWidth method) are not returned
correctly, i.e. they appear to be correct for punctuation
characters but are zero for alphanumeric characters.
It seems as if these alphanumeric characters are NOT
within PDFont.firstChar and PDFont.lastChar in the
Type 1 font. The method therefore attempts to obtain
the font widths from the AFM (font metric) file, but fails
(silently) with a 'resource is null' logline message.
(Note that this problem doesn't seem to occur with Type
1 fonts in other documents.)
A more detailed discussion regarding this issue can be

Thanks in advance for any help that can be obtained,
