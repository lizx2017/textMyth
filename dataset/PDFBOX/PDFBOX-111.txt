If you try to set a value in a PDChoiceField, it gets
into an infinite loop, and throws a stack overflow
error.
Here's the relevant code, from PDChoiceField's
*setValue* method:
if( optionValue.equals( value.getString() ) )
{ setValue( optionValue ); indexSelected = i; }
Notice that the same method is being called!! If you
look above where this code is (line 103), you'll
notice that the super class's setvalue is called at
line 91. I think you might want to do the same,
otherwise the value will never get set for the
choicefield, but will just call itself repeatedly
until the stack overflows (which is the error I got)
Please fix this!
Thanks.
