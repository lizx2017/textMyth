Summary:
PDGraphicsState class receives null page argument leading to nullpointerexception
Description:
workaround changes needed for PDGraphicsState constructor as reproduced below:
attached pdf file can be used to reproduce the exception
public PDGraphicsState(PDRectangle page) {
/*
TB - changes made here are a workaround which creates a default
GeneralPath assigned to currentClippingPath if the constructor
argument page is null. Probably a better remedy would be to ensure
that the page argument is not null or use a dedicated constructor if
page is null
*/
if (page != null) {
Dimension dimension = page.createDimension();
Rectangle rectangle = new Rectangle(dimension);
currentClippingPath = new GeneralPath(rectangle);
currentClippingPath = new GeneralPath(new Rectangle(page.createDimension()));
if (page.getLowerLeftX() != 0 || page.getLowerLeftY() != 0)
{ // Compensate for offset this.currentTransformationMatrix = this.currentTransformationMatrix.multiply(Matrix.getTranslatingInstance(-page.getLowerLeftX(), -page.getLowerLeftY())); }
} else
{ currentClippingPath = new GeneralPath(); }
}
Also, as a side effect of above workaround, made following change within PDFStreamEngine.processEncodedText:
/*
TB - needed to make change here, as we encounter here a knock on
effect of allowing null page arguments through in PDGraphicsState
constructor which creates a default GeneralPath assigned to
currentClippingPath. That workaround causes findMediaBox to return
null, so in that case we assign default values to pageHeight and
pageWidth here. Everything else seems to work as far as text
extraction is concerned.
*/
if (page.findMediaBox() != null) { pageHeight = page.findMediaBox().getHeight(); pageWidth = page.findMediaBox().getWidth(); }
else
{ pageHeight = 0; pageWidth = 0; }
