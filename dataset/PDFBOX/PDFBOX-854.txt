Summary:
PDPageContentStream.drawString() doesn't work with all PDFs
Description:
I add custom text to misc exsiting PDF files. Now I wondered why my text doesn't appear for a specific PDF. It is not encrypted, has the same page size and adding Text with iText 2.1.7 works as expected. My code to add text is:
----------------------------------
final PDPage page = (PDPage) allPages.get;
final PDPageContentStream contentStream = new PDPageContentStream(doc, page, true, false);
contentStream.beginText();
contentStream.setFont(font, sizeOfFont);
contentStream.moveTextPositionByAmount(xf, yf);
contentStream.drawString(text);
contentStream.endText();
contentStream.close();
---------------------------------
I tried to find differences between this PDF and other PDFs. What I noticed: the PDF where I can't see the text has a PDF-Version "1.3" and was created by "AFPL Ghostscript 8.54". Is there some known issue with PDFBox and such "older" PDF formats?
