Summary:
horizontal line above shaded text when printing on HP1320
Description:
This is a follow-up to PDFBOX-2141 and somewhat of PDFBOX-485. In the later, Volker Bier reported weird printing problems related to a specific part of the code that I changed again recently. While the original problem is gone, there is a new one that we discovered in a discussion in PDFBOX-2141 and it appears e.g. on the 4th page of the file pslib-shading.pdf that is in PDFBOX-1942: "above the text there is a horizontal line (about 3mm thick) that goes over the whole page".
I created a new test file that I am attaching. It has two shaded text lines and two unshaded, each time once with a standard 14 font and with an embedded type 1 font.
Volker Bier, please tell how many horizontal lines you get and where.
