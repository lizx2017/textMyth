Summary:
Slow rendering of PDF file with DeviceN jpeg file
Description:
(File submitted by Soon Keong Tan on the user mailing list)
There is a large jpeg file (5349 x 3806) that uses a DeviceN colorspace which in turn is based on CMYK. There's some slowness due to the type0 convert function from DeviceN to CMYK, but this is less than 10%. Most time is from converting the CMYK to RGB, one pixel at a time. (Because of the DeviceN colorspace we can't use bulk conversion, which may or may not be faster)
