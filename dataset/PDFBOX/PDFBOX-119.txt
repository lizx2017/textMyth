I have a PDF which has a text field whose format is
right-aligned. It's text value is 2 characters long -
"5a". If I use PDFBox to open the PDF and alter the
field value (via PDField.setValue) to a longer value
("LONGER"), opening the resulting PDF results in the
font of the text box being larger than it was before
the update, and the string begins drawing from the same
position as when it was "5a". That is, the "L" from
LONGER is painted at the same position as the 5 was
and, as the text box is right-aligned, most of the
value is hidden past the right border of the text box.
If I edit any field in the result document using
acrobat reader, the format is fixed and the full value
can be read (including a font size change).
I tried this with PDFBox-0.7.2 and CVS HEAD from
12/Jan/2006, both displayed the same problems. I am
using Acrobat reader 7.0.1 (on windows).
The first field to display the alignment problem is on
page 4 of the document, "5a" is beside it (but
rendering problems can be seen on many of the other
fields in the doc).

My PDF file was too large to attach to this bug report so I
have uploaded 2 files to the FTP server:
Form-1413808.pdf is the source document which I am trying to
process.
pdfbox-bug-1413808.zip is the bog-simple code I'm using to
update the doc. Is an ant project minus the required pdfbox
libraries.
