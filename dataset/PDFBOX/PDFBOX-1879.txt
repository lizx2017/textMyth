Summary:
Gibberish characters when converting pdf to image
Description:
Hello,
I am an API user of PDFBOX 1.8.4.
I am encountering an image conversion problem, with a specific .pdf file (attached).
Some paragraphes are displayed with gibberish characters, while others paragraphes are still readable.
In the console, there is the log below :
