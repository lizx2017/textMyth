Summary:
Non-Ascii chars are not decoded correctly by pdfbox but works fine with pdftotext
Description:
In one of my PDFs mostly non-ascii chars are not decoded correctly. The text extraction on the PDF works fine with other tools such as pdftotext and it appears to me that it is a bug that it does not work with pdfbox.
The file was produced with:
Acrobat Distiller 3.0 for Power Macinthosh
To reproduce the issue use the following command:
java -jar pdfbox-app-1.7.1.jar ExtractText -debug c1051802.pdf
Please let me know if you need any further information.
