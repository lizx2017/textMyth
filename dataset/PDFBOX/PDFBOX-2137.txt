Summary:
Rendering of Type3 string fails with NPE
Description:
Rendering of the attached PDF fails with a NPE in PDFStreamEngine at the line 395 (float spaceWidthDisp = ...) because the textMatrix field is null. The reason is that the textMatrix gets reset while processing the first character of the string in PageDrawer#drawType3String(). The attached patch fixes the problem, but I am not quite sure whether it is the right solution.
To debug this, set a breakpoint in PDFStreamEngine#processEncodedText() with the condition "string.length == 2 && string[1] == 67" and watch the textMatrix field vanish after the first character has been processed.
