Summary:
loading a CUPS-generated PDF results in RasterExceptions
Description:
I've generated a PDF with cups (a testpage) and when I try to load this PDF with the recently checked out version of PDFBox,
I get RasterExceptions because there are filters active on the inline images.
I've removed the filters in the pdf and then I can open it without errors but I also get an empty page.
Note: the pdf works with the pdf-renderer on dev.java.net and the reader of Adobe.
