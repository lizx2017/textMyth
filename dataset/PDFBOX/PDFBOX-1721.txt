Summary:
Bad scaling of printed pdf file
Description:
Hello,
I'm trying to print pdf (attached in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PDFBOX-1671 ), using commandline app (java -jar pdfbox-app-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar PrintPDF c:/mypdf.pdf) or using code in PDFBox but scaling is so bad.
Only way to print file is to render image from it and then scale it to PageFormat.
I'm attaching printed file.
