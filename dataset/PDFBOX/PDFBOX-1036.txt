Summary:
FDFExport/Import gives strange results
Description:
1. Create a new, blank PDF in Acrobat.
2. Add a text form field and set the contents to "some text".
3. Run ExportFDF and then ImportFDF on this file.
The result is a messed-up text box. See the attached files.
Also I've noticed that the FDF created by PDFBox is very different to the one created by Acrobat.
Here's my code:
ExportFDF.main(new String[]
{"c:/gilad/input/test.pdf", "c:/gilad/input/test.fdf"}
);
ImportFDF.main(new String[]
{"c:/gilad/input/test.pdf", "c:/gilad/input/test.fdf", "c:/gilad/input/result.pdf"}
);
