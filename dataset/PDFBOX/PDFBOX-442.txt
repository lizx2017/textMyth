Summary:
race condition in PdfFont
Description:
this code in PDFFont.encode isn't thread safe,
COSName encodingName = (COSName)encoding;
cmap = (CMap)cmapObjects.get( encodingName );
if( cmap != null )
{ cmap = (CMap)cmapObjects.get( encodingName ); }
cmap may be cleared in PDFont.clearResources(), and it may be cleared in the interval between the two get() calls. The first get() may be non null, while the second may be null. The second get may be removed altogether.
