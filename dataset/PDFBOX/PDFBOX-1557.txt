Summary:
NonSequentialPDFParser incorrectly parsing document info
Description:
When using the NonSequentialPDFParser, the PDDocumentInformation returned by getDocumentInformation() seems to contain all null entries, which does not occur when using the standard PDFParser. I have a large batch of PDF files which have random and strange issues that cause them to occasionally fail with the standard parser, so I was experimenting with the NonSequential parser and came across this issue.
I'll attempt to attach some test code & a test PDF file for which I can replicate the issue.
