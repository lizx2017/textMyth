Summary:
Redundant/incorrect code in PDVisibleSignDesigner.java
Description:
org/apache/pdfbox/pdmodel/interactive/digitalsignature/visible/PDVisibleSignDesigner.java contains the following in the calculatePageSize method:
    float x = pageWidth;
    float y = 0;
    pageWidth += y;
    float tPercent = (100 * y / (x + y));
    imageSizeInPercents = 100 - tPercent;
I can't see how this would result in anything but an imageSizeInPercents of 100.
