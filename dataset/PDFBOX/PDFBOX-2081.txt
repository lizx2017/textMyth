Summary:
Lines that exceeds clipping area are not drawn
Description:
PDF contains shapes that are partly on the paper and partly outside (shape overflows paper borders).
Those shapes are not rendered to image.
It is caused by clipping area.
When I replace line in PDFDrawer.strokePath()
graphics.setClip(getGraphicsState().getCurrentClippingPath());
to
graphics.setClip(null);
then everything is rendered correctly.
Possibly bug in Java?
