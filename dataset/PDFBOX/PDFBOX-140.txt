I have a document here where the Outline is based on
JavaScript actions. A samle action JS looks like
'this.pageNum = 0; this.scroll(0, 880);'.
PDFBox is able to parse the outline. But the call
firstItem.findDestinationPage(document); fails. PDF Box
is not able to understand the Javascript in the page.
I have enhanced the class PDActionJavaScript a bit with
a small 'parser' that is able to find assigments like
"this.pageNum = 10"
"pageNum=11"
"pageNum=23a11"
"this.pageNum = 12;pageNum=a11"
" this.pageNum = 7; scroll(4, 5);"
With this small fix, PDFBox is able to jump to the
right page.
The whole source is in the attachment.
I have also written a small JavaScript mocker based on
Rhino. If you interested in this drop me a note.
Sorry, but i can't provide a sample document.
