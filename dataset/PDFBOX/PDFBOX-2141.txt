Summary:
Shading not applied to text
Description:
The attached PDF draws a text filled with horizontal shading going from red to blue. When rendered via PDFBox, the text is completely filled with red. The problem is that AxialShadingContext#getRaster() gets called with positions that completely fell outside of the range stored in its coords[] field. The fix seems to be to set glyph transform rather than graphics2d transform in PageDrawer#writeText() as shown in the attached patch.
