Summary:
invalid date formats
Description:
This is with the latest from svn, Revision: 773978
From a sample of 13304 pdf documents generated in a very wide variety of ways, I got 94 invalid date formats,
It seems that all of these have the stack trace of,

i don't think there is any hope of parsing all these date formats. If would be nice if this was not a fatal error, and the parser could continue without a creation date.
Is the policy of pdfbox to be as forgiving as possible when reading pdf documents? Maybe toCalendar should return a new Calendar() if parsing fails, rather than throwing.
