Summary:
Specific Type1C methods not used anymore
Description:
In one of the last releases the PDFontFactory changed so that for Type1C fonts a PDType1Font will be created and not as before a PDType1CFont. While PDType1Font will internally instantiate a PDType1CFont several of the methods which PDType1CFont overrides are now hidden and not used (instead the PDSimpleFont variants are used).
I will add the necessary methods in an attachment which calls the appropriate methods.
However having all these type specific switches it seems to be a better solution to subclass PDType1CFont from PDType1Font.
