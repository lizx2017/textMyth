Summary:
Uppercase letters are read in lowercase manner
Description:
I have a PDF that when I read its contents using PDFBox some uppercase letters are being read as lowercase. For example :
Word "Testing" is read as "testing"
Word "Eve" is read as "eve"
Word "Deuteronomy" is read as "deuteronomy"
Andreas commented on this by: "The pdf uses marked content to replace a string (14.9.4 Replacement Text of the PDF specs provides a simple example). And yes, PDFBox doesn't support it, yet."
Please check this 1-page sample PDF.
