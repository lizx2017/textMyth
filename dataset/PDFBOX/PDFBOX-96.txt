I've run a simple test.
Initially loading an already encrypted document, then
decrypting etc.
PDDocument x = PDDocument.load
("/home/paul/pdfsin/encrypted.pdf");
x.decrypt("pass");
x.save("/home/paul/pdfsout/decrypt1.pdf");
x.setEncryptionDictionary(new PDStandardEncryption());
x.encrypt("pass",null);
x.save("/home/paul/pdfsout/encrypt1.pdf");
x.decrypt("pass");
x.save("/home/paul/pdfsout/decrypt2.pdf");
The net result of this is that the decryption on the pre-
encrypted works ok,
the subsequent re-encryption works fine. (checked
documents in acrobat, document
info OK, pages look OK and security settings as
expected)
The final decyption however fails and the
resultant "decrypt2.pdf" is all white
pages. If I modify the above to reload the "encrypt1.pdf"
file, do the decrypt
and save then the final output is fine, so it is just the in
memory version
of the PDF after encryption is non-decryptable, which of
course can fairly easily
be worked around.
