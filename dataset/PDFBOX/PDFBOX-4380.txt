Summary:
PDF will only print rasterized on Windows
Description:
Near identical symptoms to PDFBOX-4123, but only on Windows.
This PDF will only print rasterized.  It looks fine in Adobe Reader, but once printed using PDFBOX, it will always print rasterized.
PDF was created using Python weasyprint.
Like PDFBOX-4123, I found a Transparency block inspecting the PDF raw contents. However the workaround provided in PDFBOX-4123 does not remedy the situation. Furthermore, the behavior is inconsistent between macOS and Windows.
Windows testing was performed using Java 8u191 and PDFCreator.  Same behavior with Microsoft Print to PDF.
macOS testing was performed using Java 8u181 and Lisanet PDFwriter.
