Summary:
Only the last visual signature is valid when multiple signatures have been added on different pages
Description:
Every visual signature that is added invalidates the previous ones (Adobe Reader displays the message that the document has changed)
If the signatures are added to different pages only the ones that have been added to the page of the last one are visible in PDFReader (Adobe displays the message in the signature view that the form field has been deleted)
