Summary:
PDF gets corrupted when extracting it from the embedded files
Description:
When a PDF is attached to another PDF it gets corrupted when retrieved through PDEmbeddedFile.getByteArray() method call. For some reason the returned array has less data than the original file that has been attached to the PDF.
This affects some of the documents and not another (see attachments for working/non-working files), source code reproducing the issue has been attached as well.
Please note: the issue is not occurring when using PDDocument.loadNonSeq, it's on when using PDDocument.load
