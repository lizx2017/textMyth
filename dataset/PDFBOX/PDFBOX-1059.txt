Summary:
WinAnsiEncoding : the code 0251 (Copyrigth) inserted twice
Description:
Hi,
We are using PDFBox to explore the PDF file structure in Padaf. (PDF/A validation tool)
We have an issue on font validation.
For each character we have to check the width consistency of the glyph in the PDFFont dictionary and the Glyph width in the font program.
However, the WinAnsiEncoding defines the Copyright character twice with two different names. ("copyright" and "circlecopyrt") When we ask the name of the character, PDFBox returns "circlecopyrt" and this name is missing from our font program.
The "circlecopyrt" isn't the name used in the PDF Reference Appendix, so we can remove it because it is declared in a custom Encoding dictionary.
Do you agree with that point?
Best Regards,
Eric
