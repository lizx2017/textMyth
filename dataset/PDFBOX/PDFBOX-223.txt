First, I would like to suggest removing currentColor from PageDrawer and just using the colorSpaces from the current graphicsState, but to consider this, please see my comments in the forum:
http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=1624117&forum_id=267205
It seems to me that in the pdf format, when a graphics state's stroking and non-stroking colors get changed, then a restore graphics state occurs, the stroking and non-stroking colors should be reverted back to black.
Example: (Draw a red rectangle, then draw text in a pdf)
Adobe reader will be able to draw a red rectangle, and then you will see the black text.
In PDFBox, both the rectangle and text will be RED because currentColor in PageDrawer never gets reset back to black. My workaround is in the above forum post. It works for my purposes at the moment, but a more complete solutions using the colorSpaces, and updating the clone funciton of PDGraphicsState should be implemented.
I would have submitted a patch, but I'm getting weird errors when it comes to using the restored color spaces from the restored graphicsState.
