Summary:
Ineffective char2CID mapping in CMap
Description:
lookupCID(byte[] code, int offset, int length) invokes char2CIDMappings.containsKey(...) and char2CIDMappings.get(...) with an invalid argument type. This map contains String keys, but an Integer object is used as the argument. Hence, the char2CID mapping is never actually used.
