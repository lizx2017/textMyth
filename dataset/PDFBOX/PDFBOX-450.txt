Summary:
PDFTextStripper CAN NOT extract correct font information for some early produced PDF documents
Description:
PDFTextStripper can not extract correct font information from the attached document. When I traced into the code, I found that the TextPosition.getFontSize()=1 and TextPosition.getXScale() = 0.24 in all cases. However, the TextPosition.getFont().getAverageFontWidth() has different values obviously.
