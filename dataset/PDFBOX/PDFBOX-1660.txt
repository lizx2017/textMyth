Summary:
Error 6.2.4 results in description that looks more like the one belonging to 6.2.3
Description:
Analyzing the following PDF with Preflight:
https://github.com/openplanets/format-corpus/raw/master/pdfCabinetOfHorrors/webCapture.pdf
One of the reported errors is:
<error count="1">
<code>6.2.4</code>
<details>Action is forbidden, "A" must not be used in a Field dictionary</details>
</error
But the description in the 'details' element doesn't really match what I see here:
http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/pdfbox/trunk/preflight/src/main/java/org/apache/pdfbox/preflight/PreflightConstants.java
/**
A widget annotation linked with a form field shall not have any action
*/
String ERROR_ACTION_FORBIDDEN_WIDGET_ACTION_FIELD = "6.2.4";
But it does look similar to this:
/**
Additional action entry is forbidden in a form field object
*/
String ERROR_ACTION_FORBIDDEN_ADDITIONAL_ACTIONS_FIELD = "6.2.3";
So it looks like a slight mix-up (error code linked to wrong description).
