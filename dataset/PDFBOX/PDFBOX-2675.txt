Summary:
PDOutlineNode.getParent uses /P item as fallback for /Parent
Description:
On behalf of Andrea Vacondio:
I was writing unit test for the PDOutlineNode.getParent which gets the
parent node looking for a PARENT or a P key in the outline item dictionary.
Now according to table 153 of the specs only PARENT should be there so I
was wandering if someone knows better why the P is there and if it should
be covered by the unit.
Indeed, the /P is not in the spec. This has been there since 2008, and we don't have the prior history. Probably somebody copied code from elsewhere. I'll remove it.
