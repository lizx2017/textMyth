The Text is not properly extracted between the
bookmarks. Description is as follows
I used the setStartBookmark and the setEndBookmark
functions of the PDFTextStripper class to set the
begining and end of the part of text which i wanted to
extract. The first bookmark (Introduction) was present
in the second page and the second bokmark (Results) was
also present in the second page. let me explain
<page>
some text before intro blah blah blah ...
Introduction. – BOOKMARK
The real aim of
intro text is to give a simple intro..
Results. – BOOKMARK
the result is here
</page>
The text that i got was
<textExtracted>
intro text is to give a simple intro..
Results. – BOOKMARK
the result is here
</textExtracted>
but the exact result should be
<correctResult>
The real aim of
intro text is to give a simple intro..
</correctResult>
In the <textExtracted> we see that it has skipped some
text in the intro and has gone untill the end of the page.
It might be a problem with how the bookmarks were
created for this pdf. But I have tried with other pdf
files as well and they don't give the exact text
between bookmarks. If the first bookmark is on the
first page and the second on the second then I would
get all the text of the two pages irrespective of the
location of the bookmarks. I think I need to understand
how this information is present in the structure of a
PDF File and how pdfbox accesses it, is it a problem in
the creation of the bookmarks when the pdf is made or
we are missing something? I will be looking at the
PDFReference Guide to understand. Meanwhile any help
regarding the solution of this issue and the info on
how bookmarks are represented in a pdf structure would
be highly appreciated..

Hasan
