Summary:
Bad sizing of signature field inside rotated page
Description:
From Patrick Herber in the user mailing list:
I have some problems with the sizing of a signature field inside a rotated document page (90
degrees).
If instead of specifying the zoom factor (as in the CreateVisibleSignature example) I specify
the desired height and width of the signature, the resulting image has completely wrong dimensions:
visibleSignDesigner.xAxis(x).yAxis(y).height(height).width(width).adjustForRotation();
If the page is not rotated or if I remove the call to adjustForRotation() then the image is
correctly displayed (in case of rotated document of course rotated but with the correct proportions).
The problem is that adjustForRotation() is hard-coded for 200 x 100 size (zoomed at 50%).
