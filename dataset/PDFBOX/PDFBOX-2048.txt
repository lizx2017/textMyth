Summary:
TextExtraction only working after uncompressing with pdftk
Description:
From Jonas Karlsson on the user list:
===
We have a user with PDFs generated by a commercial transcription service.
When we try to extract text from these pdfs, pdfbox returns a few empty
lines. We get this result both from our own code, and when using the
ExtractText command line tool
If I specify the non-sequential parser, with the -nonSeq flag, the
following error is produced:
Apr 28, 2014 10:35:11 AM org.apache.pdfbox.pdfparser.NonSequentialPDFParser
validateStreamLength
SEVERE: The end of the stream doesn't point to the correct offset, using
workaround to read the stream
If I uncompress the file with pdftk, pdfbox is able to successfully extract
the text.
===
I have been given permission to attach the file "committers only". So don't pass it around, avoid quoting details from the file. The file is also not rendering. The lengths of the streams are 0.
