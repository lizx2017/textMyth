We are using PDFBox to create thumbnails of the first
page of PDF documents using PDPage.convertToImage().
While this works like a charm in general, there are
cases where only the images appear correctly and the
remaining page area is just plain black. This is
probably due to some failure in
extracting/using/understanding/... the font? Please see
the attached example PDF.
If there is (really) no way to generate the text output
(by using a default font like in other places of PDFBox
for instance), we would be quite okay – in fact even
much happier as we are now g – to receive an
exception instead. (This would allow us to assign a
default thumbnail for example.)
Thanks for your help,
Reinhold
