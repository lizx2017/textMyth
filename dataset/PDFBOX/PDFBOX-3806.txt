Summary:
Nullpointer exception in getLeftSideBearing
Description:
While processing todays batch of data we got a Nullpointer exception in getLeftSideBearing. Sadly I can't give you the PDF.
```
public int getLeftSideBearing(int gid)
{ return gid < this.numHMetrics?this.leftSideBearing[gid]:this.nonHorizontalLeftSideBearing[gid - this.numHMetrics]; }
```
In this function there could be a case where nonHorizontalLeftSideBearing is null and you still ask for a GID in larger or equal to numHMetrics.
First time I see this issue and so far only 4 characters in one PDF has this issue so not critical.
