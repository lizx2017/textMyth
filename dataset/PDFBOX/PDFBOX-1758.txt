Summary:
Preflight doesn't report Filespec dictionary that refers (indirectly) to an EmbeddedFile entry in some cases
Description:
File:
http://acroeng.adobe.com/Test_Files/file_attachments//non_PDF_ACRO___FileAttachment.pdf(http://acroeng.adobe.com/Test_Files/file_attachments//non_PDF_ACRO___FileAttachment.pdf)
This document contains a Filespec dictionary that refers (indirectly) to an EmbeddedFile entry:
1219 0 obj
<<
/Type /Filespec
/F (index.pdx)
>>
endobj
Refers to:
1231 0 obj
<<
/F (index.pdx)
/Type /F
/EF << /F 1232 0 R >>
>>
endobj
Which refers to:
1232 0 obj
<< /Filter [ /FlateDecode ] /Length 497 /Type /EmbeddedFile
/Params << /CheckSum <5086e4cbb19fe27f3c0a9a1ba731ffb6>/Size 908
/CreationDate (D:20030115022333)
/ModDate (D:20010910104344)>> >>
stream
...
endstream
endobj
Because of this I would expect error 1.2.9 (Body Syntax error, EmbeddedFile entry is present in a FileSpecification dictionary) here, but this is not reported by Preflight.
