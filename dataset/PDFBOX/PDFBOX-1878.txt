Summary:
Tags are not being displayed in Adobe Acrobat Tags panel when merging pdfs
Description:
The merged PDF output produced by the PDFMergerUtility does not display the tags correctly in the Tags panel of Adobe Acrobat. (Tested in Acrobat Pro XI trial version). Have not tested in another PDF tool that can display tags (not sure if another tool can do this).
A single blank entry is shown instead of the actual structure tree of the combined source pdfs.
Though, it seems the reading order (based on the tag structure) is still preserved (based on the testing of adobe reader's read aloud feature).
Possibly related to fix on tag merging:
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PDFBOX-1342
Although the tag merging logic is wrong is 1.8.2 (as only the first page is tagged which was fixed as indicated in PDFBOX-1342), the tags appear correctly in the Tag panel.
This bug prevents users from modifying the tag structure in Acrobat as the tag entries are missing.
