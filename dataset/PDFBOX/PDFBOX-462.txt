Summary:
Problems parsing a PDF
Description:
I have a PDF file which I want to load using PDFParser.load(InputStream, null), but some way through the parsing process BaseParser.parseDirObject() throws an IOException("expected false actual='fa'"). I downloaded the latest source code for the class and in line 871 indeed the string "false" is expected, but "fa" followed by three empty bytes is received.
