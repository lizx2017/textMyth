Summary:
1.8 shadings are sometimes flipped
Description:
Some of my shading test images are sometimes flipped when done with the 1.8 branch, not with the trunk. I have observed this with shadingtype 1, 4 and 5.
The shadingContext is created with an AffineTransform (the CTM is identical and its just a translation) of
[1.0, 0.0, 399.0]
[0.0, 1.0, 49.0]
for the 1.8 branch (bad)
and with
[1.0, 0.0, 399.0]
[0.0, -1.0, 149.0]
for the trunk (good).
