Summary:
Merged PDF/A files no longer valid PDF/A
Description:
From Alexander K. on the mailing list:
Situation: We have a bunch of PDF/A-1b compliant documents from a 3rd
party system and merge them into a new document. The end result is not
PDF/A-1b compliant though.
The cause is that the outputIntents are ignored. But if all are copied, the file isn't valid either because only one outputIntent is allowed.
