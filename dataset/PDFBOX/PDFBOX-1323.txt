Summary:
PDF with subset CIDFontType2 (TTF) paints wrong characters
Description:
A PDF created with Apache FOP containing a CID TrueType font shows bad characters when painted. Since PDFBox apparently cannot currently load the subset TTF, the font is substituted but that information is not propagated from the descendant font to the parent font. As a consequence, the codepoints are used instead of the Unicode text which results in the wrong glyphs being used.
