Summary:
wasted work in TrailerValidationProcess.compareIds()
Description:
The problem appears in revision 1414788. I attached a four-line patch
that fixes it. This problem and the attached patch are similar the
previously fixed PDFBOX-1447 and its patch.
In method "TrailerValidationProcess.compareIds", the loop over
"af.toList()" (outer loop) should break immediately after "isEqual"
becomes "false", because "isEqual = isEqual && oneIsEquals;" can never
become "true" again.
The loop over "al.toList()" (inner loop) should break immediately
after "oneIsEquals" is set to "true". All the iterations after
"oneIsEquals" is set to "true" do not perform any useful work because
the "if" statement depends on "!oneIsEquals".
