First, thanks for this wonderful api.
I have a problem extracting text from a pdf document
provided with adobe acrobat reader : ENUtxt.pdf.
The pdf contains text with chinese fonts which cannot
be extracted.
But, it contains also this text (extract with xpdf or
acrobat reader) :
---------------------------------------
Lorem ipsum dolor
ad minim
---------------------------------------
The problem is i obtain on my Writer with
PDFTextStripper.WriteText something like this :
---------------------------------------
-PSFNJQTVNEPMPS
BENJOJNWFSOJBNÃ´H
---------------------------------------
And between this valid characters, there are these
invalid characters :
0x0, 0x1, 0x5, 0x6, 0x18.
Because, i sax the content of a document into a xml,
the resulting xml is not valid because it contains
invalid characters...
