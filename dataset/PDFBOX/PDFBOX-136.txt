And you just had to replace
public COSStandardOutputStream(OutputStream out)
{ super( out ); }
by
public COSStandardOutputStream(OutputStream out)
{ super( new BufferedOutputStream(out,16384) ); }
. Here are some timings for my local drive (i do some
other stuff for the first 4 seconds...).
old way: 5103 ms
new way: 4403 ms
On my remote drive:
old way: 136792 ms
new way: 4756 ms
The reason should be clear... Network-packages for
nearly each and every written byte in the pdf.

The bug is, that only the old way exists in the repository,
so i wrote this, to have someone change this in cvs.
Or does anyone has cvs write access here? Then the bug is my
stupidity, since i could have it done myself

I don't think I understand what the bug is? If old was was
136 seconds and new way is 4 seconds then what is the
problem?
