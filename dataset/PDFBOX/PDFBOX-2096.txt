Summary:
ICC profile ignored if number of components is 1
Description:
The method getRGBImage in PDPixelMap ignores the ICC profile of an ICCBased color space if the number of components is 1 (ll. 320-321 in 1.8.5):
byte[] map = new byte[] {(byte)0xff};
cm = new IndexColorModel(bpc, 1, map, map, map, Transparency.OPAQUE);
This gives me a blank image in my PDF.
If I use the code in l. 325
cm = colorspace.createColorModel( bpc );
I get the expected result.
I'm sorry that I'm not allowed to attach the affected PDF. If required I would try to generate a different one.
