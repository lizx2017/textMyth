Summary:
DPI always 96
Description:
I'm trying to convert a 1 page pdf report to an image using convertToImage.
My used command goes as follows:
BufferedImage bi=page.convertToImage(BufferedImage.TYPE_INT_RGB, 300);
No matter how much i change the resolution (300 in the example), the DPI stays the same, even though the quality and the dimensions of the picture change.
Adding a comparison between a 96 resolution picture and what should be a 300 resolution picture (notice the DPI)
