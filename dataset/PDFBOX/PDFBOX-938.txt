Wrong extracted text using PDFBox 1.4
Description:
Hello ,
I am using PDFBox v1.4 to extract some text from a PDF, but some words are not extracted right.
For example words :
"Nefteiugansk" is read: "Nežeiugansk"
"fiancee" is read: "Äancée"
"first" is read: "Ärst"
Please check the attached file to test this.
Best regards
