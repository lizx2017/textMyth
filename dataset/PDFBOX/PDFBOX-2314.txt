Summary:
Restore backward compatibility between Overlay and OverlayPDF
Description:
There is a major difference with the way the overlay pages are handled between the Overlay tool from PDFBox 1.6.x and the latest OverlayPDF in 1.8.6.
In the original version, when using a multi-page PDF overlay, all pages from the overlay would be combined with the original document. The latest version only uses the first page of the overlay.
Example with a 6 page document and a 2 page (A, B) overlay:
Expected behavior:
A, B, A, B, A, B
Current behavior:
A, A, A, A, A, A
Here's the reference to the documentation of the original behavior taken from http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/pdfbox/tags/1.6.0/pdfbox/src/main/java/org/apache/pdfbox/Overlay.java?view=markup
/**
* Overlay on document with another one.<br>
* e.g. Overlay an invoice with your company layout<br>
* <br>
* How it (should) work:<br>
* If the document has 10 pages, and the layout 2 the following is the result:<br>
* <pre>
* Document: 1234567890
* Layout  : 1212121212
* </pre>
