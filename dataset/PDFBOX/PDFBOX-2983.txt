Summary:
Corrupted PDF after adding text
Description:
We have a web application which writes an official stamp to PDF documents after they have been approved. Recently some PDFs have become corrupted after the stamp is written to the document. The stamp appears on the document, but all other content is removed. Adobe Reader also displays a dialogue box indicating the document has been corrupted.
