Summary:
extracting Japanese characters gives garbage
Description:
when extracting text from this pdf file, I got this exception, and the text extracted was gibberish.
44 [main] ERROR org.apache.pdfbox.pdmodel.font.PDFont - Error: Could not parse predefined CMAP file for 'Adobe-Japan1-UCS2'
PDFBox 1.2.1 worked fine with the same file, I wonder why 1.4.0 could not.
