Summary:
PDPAgeContentStream moved, not mentioned in migration guide
Description:
The pdfbox.pdmodel.edit package is removed. The class PDPageContentStream is pulled into the parent package. This is not mentioned in the migration guide (neither in "breaking api changes nor on "new package structure"). I would add it to the API changes
PDPageContentStream class is moved into org.apachepdfbox.pdmodel package, so the edit subpackage could be removed.
