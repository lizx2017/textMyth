Summary:
Multi Page print doesn't work with "book.append(new PDFPrintable(document), pageFormat);"
Description:
In the method printWithPaper of Printing.java example,
if I use java.awt.print.Book as in the example:
Book book = new Book();
book.append(new PDFPrintable(document), pageFormat);
job.setPageable(book);
when I execute job.print(); it print only the first page of the document.
I solved this issue by replacing the three rows mentioned above with:
job.setPrintable(new PDFPrintable(document), pageFormat);
by that all pages are printed.
I hope this is useful for someone.
