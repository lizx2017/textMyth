Summary:
Image rendering fails (1 bit per component image)
Description:
I'm trying to extract an image from a pdf. But somehow PDFBox makes a mess with the image components. I've attached the PDF page and the output image (Converted with PDFBox-PDFToImage 2.0.4) Perhaps there is a bug in the SampledImageReader?
