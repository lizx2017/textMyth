Summary:
PDF file created with LaTeX is bad parsed
Description:
I'm getting an unexpected behavior parsing a pdf file.
I'm trying to get the clean body text of some file, and I get a lot of aXX strings. Where each X is a number. It appear be the char code of the real character, I don't know really.
My code is too simple:
String[] args =
{"/home/ernesto/tesis/documento/kvfs.pdf"}
;
ExtractText.main(args);
I used the PDFBox 0.8.0-incubator version. Builded on 20/9/2009.
The output I get is:
a73a109a112a108a101a109a101a110a116a97a110a100a111 a97a99a99a101a115a111 a97 a115a105a115a116a101a109a97a115 a100a101

and more ......
The pdf file was generated by pdflatex command, in Ubuntu 9.
The pdf properties are:
producer: pdfTeX-1.40.3
format: PDF-1.4
security: NO
optimized: NO
paper: A4, vertical (210 x 297 mm)
When I run the PDFBox test, I get this by the console:
