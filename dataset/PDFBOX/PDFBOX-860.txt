Summary:
'fi' getting converted to '?'
Description:
Hi
I am trying to use PDF box 1.2.1 version to extract text from PDF files.
The following issue is observed in the extracted text:
1. Combination of the characters 'fi' is converted to a '?'
example: first becomes ?rst
classifier becomes classi?er
find becomes ?nd
Is this a known bug? Can some setting of the PDF box be turned of to prevent this?
Thanks & Regards
Saurabh
