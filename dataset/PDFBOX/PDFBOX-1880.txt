Summary:
[PATCH] Type 1 Shading must not ignore current transformation matrix
Description:
My implementation for Type 1 Shading (PDFBOX-1869) ignored the current transformation matrix, because I thought that the shading matrix would be relevant only. That is the cause for the wrong rendering of the rgbcube file. The attached patch fixes this.
