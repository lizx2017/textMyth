Summary:
TypeTestingHelper is non-deterministic
Description:
TypeTestingHelper generates random calendar data and random UUIDs for testing, which means that it is non-deterministic.
As discussed in PDFBOX-1977, we should alter this test to make sure that it has deterministic (regression test) functionality as well as the existing non-deterministic (fuzz test) functionality.
