Summary:
PDFParser should set "direct" property in COSBase if this object is direct
Description:
PDFParser during PDF parsing does not update COSBase#direct property - it always return false when read. Especially this issue manifests for dictionary objects when PDF is saved (either regularly or incrementally) - all dictionary objects in saved PDF, if they do not have COSBase#direct property set or are not specifically treated by COSWriter (like XObject or Resources) are written as indirect objects. Though PDF specification allows dictionary objects to be indirect, but not for /Extensions dictionary in document catalog: "The extensions dictionary, all developer extensions dictionary entries in the extensions dictionary, as well as their entries, all shall be direct objects (i.e., this information shall be nested directly within the catalog dictionary with no indirect objects used)." (see ISO 32000-1: 7.12 Extensions Dictionary).
