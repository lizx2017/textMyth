Summary:
Merge test checkWithNumberTree() fails when widget has no StructParent
Description:
I tried merging a large amount of digitalcorpora files and it failed immediately in checkWithNumberTree(). I narrowed it down to a single file - that one has fields with widgets with no StructParent. PDFBox returns these as "0" which would be a valid number. These getters should return -1 instead and callers should check the result.
