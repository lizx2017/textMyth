Summary:
Unwanted spaces in text extraction
Description:
From testing on my internal dataset I believe there might be some regression in the effectiveness of PDFTextStripper.
Here's an example doc I found on the web, which converted better in 1.8 than 2.0. Notice that it extracts "J e a n e t t e A c o s t a ; S e r v i c e M a n a g e r a t M a d F o x B r e w i n g C o m p a n y". It doesn't seem like there's very much space between the letters in the pdf, so it's curious to me that it didn't do too well.
I realize this is an area where we probably can't strive for perfection. Yet, it does seem to me that from 1.8 to 2.0 we may have taken a step backwards. I believe there's some sort of regression test for PDFToImage which exports a set of pdfs to images at two different commits and looks at what the differences are. Do we have the same sort of thing for PDFTextStripper? If not, can we build one by pulling docs off the public web? I'd be willing to contribute to this endeavor.
