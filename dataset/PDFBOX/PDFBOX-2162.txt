Summary:
annotation that highlights a text is not visible in image (converted from the pdf)
Description:
Hi, I'm trying to convert in images (png or jpeg) a PDF file in which I've added an annotation within each page through the PDAnnotationTextMarkup object.
I've used PDFImageWriter to achieve this convertion and the images are correctly generated excepted that the annotation has disappeared.
It seems that there is a mistake because if for example I open my PDF file with acrobat reader and then I re-save it under a new PDF file and then I relaunch my image conversion script with this latter one, the images generated will this time contain the annotations.
