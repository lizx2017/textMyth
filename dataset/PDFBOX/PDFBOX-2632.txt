Summary:
Lost output when mixing subset and non-subset of the same font
Description:
On behalf of Michael Klink:
There still is a small bug in that font subsetting in the current SNAPSHOT: If on the same page you first use a font without subsetting
stream.setFont(font, 12, false);
then add some text, then use the same font with subsetting
stream.setFont(font, 12, true);
then add some more text, the text drawn up to the second font setting operation may be incomplete.
