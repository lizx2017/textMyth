Summary:
Narrow long pdf is printed blank
Description:
Based on the post of Norbert SÃ¡ndor to the user list:
When printing a 198.425 x 1700.787 sized page (70 x 600 mm) using new PDFPrinter(pdfDocument, printJob).silentPrint() to a virtual printer (e.g. PDFCreator or CIB), then the resulting PDF has a page size of 8,26x11,69 and the content is horizontally centered on the page. I was able to reproduce the problem, and also to print on a virtual printer that creates new PDFs of that size, by using the longest constructor of PDFPrinter(), but then the output is blank.
While it doesn't seem useful to print a PDF to a PDF, the problem might make sense when printing to a cash register receipt printer.
