Right now, when you try to print a PDDocument that has rotated pags (ie. /ROTATE 90) it does not currently take the rotation into consideration when figuring out the PageFormat for a given page. I fixed this and submitted a patch for it.
I wasn't sure if you needed a bug written up in order to process and close the fix via the patch submitted.
