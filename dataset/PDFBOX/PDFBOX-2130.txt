Summary:
PDAnnotationLinks are empty after saving as in Acrobat
Description:
Hello dear pdfbox team,
Do you have any idea on how to fix the problem with the not working links after „saving as“ in Acrobat?
The PDAnnotationLinks/goToPage-action/ PDPageDestination(PDPageFitHeihtDestination... doesn’t matter) –
If you create a copy of the document using „save as“ option, than the links in the new document are empty – no properties, no destinations.
It seams that acrobat overriding then. The with acrobat created links remaining only.
Besides the COSArrays of the Destinations 'created in acrobat manually' and 'automatically using pdfbox' are slightly different.
It’s a big Problem if you cannot save the document under other name without links being destroyed.
