Summary:
SecurityHandler should not try to decrypt TU entries
Description:
The SecurityHandler should not try to decrypt TU entries, just like it does not decrypt CONTENTS of signatures. Patch attached.
Unfortunately I cannot share the file which shows the problem with the current behavior. The issue is that it tries to decrypt something not encrypted in the first place.
