Summary:
Gray color images much lighter
Description:
In testCreateLosslessFromImageRGB() I create a grayscale image, and in LosslessFactory.createFromImage() I save it as a grayscale image (that part is currently disabled, search and enable the part with BufferedImage.TYPE_BYTE_GRAY. When this is enabled, testCreateLosslessFromImageRGB() fails the identity test. The expected and the actual images are attached. I traced this effect to PDColorSpace.toRGBImageAWT(), where I saved the "src" and the "dest" image and got two different ones. But even the first one is already different to the grayscale image I created in the test.
The two attached file pairs were created by writing the BufferedImage src and dst in PDColorSpace.toRGBImageAWT().
