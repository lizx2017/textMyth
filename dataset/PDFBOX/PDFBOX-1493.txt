Summary:
String ending in close paren disappears
Description:
As summary states, when opening a PDF created via PDFBox, if the initial data field in the form ends with a closing parenthesis the PDF will show nothing for that field.
Using getValue after the setValue does show the data.
Using PrintField prior to closing the document does show the data.
