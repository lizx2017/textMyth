Summary:
ResourceLoader returns NULL on missing Resources
Description:
When using pdfbox-1.0.0.jar:
---------------------------------------
public static void main(String[] args)
{ String mystr = org.apache.pdfbox.Version.getVersion(); System.out.println(mystr); }
Leads to:
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException
at org.apache.pdfbox.Version.getVersion(Version.java:52)
at Test1.main(Test1.java:10)
Problem:
------------
pdfbox-1.0.0.jar is missing the "pdfbox.version"-Resource, which was still available in pdfbox-0.8.0-incubating.jar. So the "getVersion" returns, what the Resource-Loader returns: null.
This leads to the exception descibed above.
I am wondering, if this behaviour is ok. I think it is missleading and can be traced down to a problem in the org.apache.pdfsbox.util.ResourceLoader:
Beginning in Line 74:
----------------------------
if( is == null )
{
File f = new File( resourceName );
if( f.exists() )
{ is = new FileInputStream( f ); }
}

IMHO there should be added an else-statment:
---------------------------------------------------------------
if( is == null )
{
File f = new File( resourceName );
if( f.exists() )
{ is = new FileInputStream( f ); }
else
{ throw new IOException( "Error: could not find resource '" + resourceName + "' on classpath." ); }
}
Perhaps it is a good idea to add a Boolean-Flag (boolean failIfNotFound) like in the loadProperties-method, so that it is still possible to query for the existence of a special Resource.
