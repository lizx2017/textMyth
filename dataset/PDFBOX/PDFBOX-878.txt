Summary:
Incorrect text extraction when text rotation is not 0,90,180,270
Description:
Currently text extraction only supports 0, 90, 180 or 270 degrees rotation, so text rotated in another angle is extracted incorrectly. I attached one simple PDF and the text extraction result as output from ExtractText.
I have made a patch for the current revision (1.4.0) in which I consider any rotation in the current matrix position. I have had to refactor the considering of (0,0) as upper-left since for rotations places outside of the original asumption, could happen that a word or a line could be splitted.
Since we have some needs for a project in we are working, I have made changes to the way normalization and line printing is done, in the current codebase the normalize function is returing a List of Strings, my changes make this method return a List of Words, which are ICU normalized and therefore printed in the current writeLine method. In my patch I have also included a sample PDF2XML class, which converts the PDF to a XML, managing each word in a separate way.
I submit the test-cases and the patch for your consideration.
