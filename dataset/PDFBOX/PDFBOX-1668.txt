Summary:
Loading a Russian PDF never finishes
Description:
Try to run this line:
PDDocument.load(new URL("http://www.who.int/entity/foodsafety/publications/general/en/global_strategy_ru.pdf"));
The loading never finishes... taking a lot of CPU.
The document size (574K) should not be the problem. I guess something in that document causes the issue with PdfBox. And I'd like to know if such could be a more general issue or what.
Thanks!
