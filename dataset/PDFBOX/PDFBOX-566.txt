Summary:
PDChoiceField does not handle some valid PDFs
Description:
The problem is that there are cases where sometimes the format is periodically a array and/or a singleton. The attached fix allows it to work smoothly for either system and for mixed cases. May also be more efficient.
See attached diff and corrected source file.
