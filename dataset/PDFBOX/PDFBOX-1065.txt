Summary:
PDF Link Annotations not working after Merge - PDFBox version 1.6.0
Description:
Hi All,
We are using Apache PDFBox-v1.6.0 to merge PDF documents. Strangely we are facing issues with the Annotations & Links after merging the PDF documents.
Say 1_testfile1.pdf has 3 Link annotations. If this PDF document is opened seperately, upon clicking the annotation it properly takes
us to the annotation reference.
2_testfile1.pdf has 3 Link annotations, likewise the annotation and its references are properly working.
Once these documents are merged using PDFBox-v1.6.0, the annotations in the first PDF alone works without any issues. When we click the annotations in the second/merged PDF nothing happens.
I do have the 1_testfile1.pdf, 2_testfile1.pdf and merged output.pdf. Please mail me (sgkrishnan_5@yahoo.com) in case you need the PDF files for testing. Can anyone please help me in resolving this issue? Let me know if you require any other information.
Regards,
Gokul
