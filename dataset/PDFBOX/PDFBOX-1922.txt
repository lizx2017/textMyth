Summary:
NonSequentialParser not reading version in header and trailer
Description:
On older pdf files, the NonSequentialParser returns a different PDFVersion than the traditional parser via the call: document.getDocument().getVersion().
I think this is because NonSequentialParser is not reading the header but relying on the default 1.4 if no version is found in the trailer.
Many apologies if this is a duplicate. I feel like I've seen this issue elsewhere, but I can't track it down.
