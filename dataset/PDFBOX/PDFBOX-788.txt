Summary:
PrintPDF does not take the windows default printer orientation into account
Description:
We have 2 printers, the first one is defined to print in Portrait by default in Windows, the other one is defined to print in Landscape by default in Windows.
PrintPDF does not take the default configuration into account.
I wrote a little patch that seems to solve this bug
