In trying to integrate with lucene, I was having
problems. The Lucene people suggested that I check
the output of extract utility against one of my test pdf's.
When I did, I saw spaces placed inside many of the
words. I was on version 0.7.0. So I downloaded 0.7.1
and see the same results.
One of the test files where I see this issue is attached.
