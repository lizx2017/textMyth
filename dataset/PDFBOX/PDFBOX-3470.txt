Summary:
Set border and background color in AcroForm field appearance
Description:
Follow-up on PDFBOX-2918 - set border and background color so that the CreateSimpleForm.java example can be improved with this code, which I've had for some time and forgot to commit:
        // set green border and yellow background
        // if you prefer defaults, just delete this code block
        PDAppearanceCharacteristicsDictionary fieldAppearance
                = new PDAppearanceCharacteristicsDictionary(new COSDictionary());
        fieldAppearance.setBorderColour(new PDColor(new float[]{0,1,0}, PDDeviceRGB.INSTANCE));
        fieldAppearance.setBackground(new PDColor(new float[]{1,1,0}, PDDeviceRGB.INSTANCE));
        widget.setAppearanceCharacteristics(fieldAppearance);
without needing to call acroForm.setNeedAppearances(true);. While looking at it, I also found a bug in the current code, the border color is set with the non stroking color.
