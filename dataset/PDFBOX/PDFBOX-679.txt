Summary:
Corruption of Arabic output due to Japanese bug fix
Description:
The recent Japanese bug fix in org.apache.pdfbox.pdmodel.font.PDFont
defines a set of encoding names that are given special CJK treatment. This set is too broad. For example, it stipulates that the 'Identity-H' encoding should be processed as JIS.
We have Arabic PDFs where compound Arabic glyphs use the 'Identity-H' encoding. In pdfBox 1.0.0 they used to output Arabic but now they output garbage, because the Arabic unicode data is sent to the CJK converter.
I've copied that description from the users mailing list [1]
