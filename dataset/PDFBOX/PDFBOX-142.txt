PDFToImage doesn't support colors, field contents and
vertical text.
I know, that the PDFToImage is only a beta version.
When do you plan to release a full version?

Thanks for the bug report and the example PDF documents.
Here are my thoughts on the unsupported parts of that PDF
1)colors should be easy to add, they do already work in
certain situations
2)Field contents should not be too bad either, just need to
execute that appearance stream
3)Vertical text might be a little more difficult
A full version of PDFToImage is a huge amount of work. I
am adding pieces as I can but it will be a long time before
a high quality version is available.
