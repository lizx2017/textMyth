Summary:
FlateFilter: endless loop because of missing length check (for encrypted pdfs)
Description:
if mayRead is set to zero than following statement is executed endlessly:
while ((amountRead = decompressor.read(buffer, 0, Math.min(mayRead,BUFFER_SIZE))) != -1)
{ result.write(buffer, 0, amountRead); }
we just have to check that mayRead > 0 zero.
