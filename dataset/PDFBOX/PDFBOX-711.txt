Findbugs: Bug: Doomed test for equality to NaN PDFTextStripper.java
Description:
org.apache.pdfbox.util.PDFTextStripper.java
if ((wordSpacing == 0) || (wordSpacing == Float.NaN))
(wordSpacing == Float.NaN) always fails, should use the method to test the value.
if ((wordSpacing == 0) || Float.isNaN(wordSpacing )
Findbugs Description: Bug: Doomed test for equality to NaN
Pattern id: FE_TEST_IF_EQUAL_TO_NOT_A_NUMBER, type: FE, category: CORRECTNESS
This code checks to see if a floating point value is equal to the special Not A Number value (e.g., if (x == Double.NaN)). However, because of the special semantics of NaN, no value is equal to Nan, including NaN. Thus, x == Double.NaN always evaluates to false. To check to see if a value contained in x is the special Not A Number value, use Double.isNaN (or Float.isNaN if x is floating point precision).
