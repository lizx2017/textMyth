Summary:
Re-setting filled properties of PDDocumentInformation do not "take"
Description:
Setting any of the properties on PDDocumentInformation which were already filled-in has no effect. The old values remain in place.
Empty properties can be set to new values, but pre-existing values can't be changed or removed.
File info:
PDF Version: 1.6
Producer: Distiller 7.0.5
I can upload the files somewhere, if necessary.
