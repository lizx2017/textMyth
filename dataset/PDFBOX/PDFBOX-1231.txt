Description:
On a PDF with an AcroForm, when setting the PDVariableText value, there's a problem with the encoding. The value is stored on the PDF as UTF-8 instead of ISO8859-1.
Another problem is when setting the value again the FontSize set is lost, and if the textbox is multiline it also doesn't work.
