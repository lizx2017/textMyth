Summary:
Lost links when merging with PDFMergerUtility (PDFMergerUtility does not merge Dests)
Description:
When I merge to PDFs into one using PDFMerger the Destinations of the second PDF given are being lost.
I looked into PDFMergerUtility class and found that mergeInto called on Names' COSDictionary doesn't work as intended.
I tried to solve this problem, see the attached patch. Now I get both Destinations in the result PDF.
Please review & correct my lines before importing.
