Summary:
PDFMergeUtility error invalid stored block lengths
Description:
PDFMergeUtility fails with a DataFormatException when trying to merge PDF documents.
Caused by: java.util.zip.DataFormatException: invalid stored block lengths
I have attached 3 PDF documents
pdf-01.pdf
pdf-02.pdf
pdf-03.pdf
The first two PDF documents are good. They can be merged. In fact they were used to create the third document (pdf-03.pdf).
When trying to merge another PDF with the third document, the PDF merge utility throws the error.
