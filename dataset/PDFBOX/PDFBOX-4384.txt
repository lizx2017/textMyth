Summary:
PDF/A Document Validation out of memory
Description:
Hi everyone,
validating a customer PDF file, using
document.validate()
we recognise that if the file itself has an enormous numbers of validation errors, the process goes to OutOfMemory and at the end the we get the GC error.
In our case the file has more than 550.000 errors. So we cannot go head with the conversion to PDF/A. 
To avoid this kind of error it could be useful to configure a max number of validation errors to stop the process if this value has been reached.
We cannot attach the original document, because it is a customer's file.
