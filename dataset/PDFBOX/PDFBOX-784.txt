Wrong text position
Description:
we tried to convert a lot of PDF files to image(e.g. tif, jpg) on two servers, it worked OK at the begging period, but after converting a cerntain quantity of PDF files, something went wrong, all the characters were drawn at the bottom of the image file. Does anyone meet this problem before?
we invoke the method below to convert pdf to image
