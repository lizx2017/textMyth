Summary:
Can't set destination of a PDOutlineItem to null
Description:
Because of the overloaded setDestination() method of PDOutlineItem it's not possible to set it to null and therefore remove the Go To Named Destination action, like it is possible with PDOutlineItem.setAction(), for example.
Sample code:
PDOutlineItem bookmark = doc.getDocumentCatalog().getDocumentOutline().getFirstChild();
bookmark.setDestination(null); // DOES NOT COMPILE
