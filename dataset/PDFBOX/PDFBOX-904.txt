Summary:
Potential issue with COSString and UTF-16-encoded Strings.
Description:
I've been looking into PDFBOX-903 and I came across a potential issue with the COSString class.
The issue occurs when you construct an instance of COSString and pass a UTF-16-encoded String.
The current code (trunk) checks the passed String parameter in the constructor to see if it is UTF-16. It does this by looking for char values above 255.
Whilst a String that contains char values greater than 255 is likely to be UTF-16, it is possible to have UTF-16-encoded Strings whose characters do not exceed this limit.
These Strings would be incorrectly marked as being not unicode16. An example (from the upcoming patch)
/**してく */
String textHighBits = "\u3057\u3066\u304f";
Furthermore, if you construct a COSString using the COSString(byte[]) constructor, then the COSString class cannot know what the encoding is.
I will attach a patch in a moment which includes a test case to reproduce the issue and a fix for the product code.
