Summary:
Setting empty values on listbox keeps marked item
Description:
PDListBox multiListBox = (PDListBox) acroForm.getField("multiple_listbox");
multiListBox.setValue(new ArrayList<>());
When looking at the file with Adobe Reader, there is still an element selected.
The cause is that the /I entry isn't removed.
