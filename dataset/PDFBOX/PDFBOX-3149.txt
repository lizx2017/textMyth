Summary:
Failure to decrypt empty strings (AES 128)
Description:
SecurityHandler fails to decrypt empty strings in a AES 128 encrypted PDF.
Strings like: <</Name ()>>
This is because it tries to read the first 16 bytes as the AES IV, failing which it throws IOException. Solution: if you cannot read any bytes from the stream, it is empty and so there is nothing to decrypt.
