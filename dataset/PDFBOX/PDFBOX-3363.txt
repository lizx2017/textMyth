Summary:
Leftover file in temp directory when signing
Description:
As reported by Damien Butaye on the mailing list:
I'm trying to add a signature to a PDF using PDFBOX 2.0.1. During the
process, a tmp file (e.g: tmpPDFBoxXXX.pdf) is stored inside the /tmp
directory (RehHat server). This file is not deleted after completion.
After some checks, it seems that the object responsible of the file
creation is "RandomAccessBufferedFileInputStream(InputStream is)". This
object is used by the PDFParser object which doesn't close the stream
after
completion.
and his solution:
For your information I found a workaround to avoid the problem of tmp file
deletion. In the SignatureOptions object, I modified the method *public
void setVisualSignature(InputStream is) *with the following content :
RandomAccessBufferedFileInputStream tmp=new
RandomAccessBufferedFileInputStream(is); --> NEW LINE
PDFParser parser = new PDFParser(tmp); --> NEW LINE
parser.parse();
visualSignature = parser.getDocument();
tmp.close(); --> NEW LINE
Tmp files are well deleted and all unit tests passed without error on the
pdfbox maven project.
