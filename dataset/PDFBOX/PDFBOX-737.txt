Summary:
Fix potential NullPointer exception in PDPageNode
Description:
getAllKids(List result, COSDictionary page, boolean recurse) throws a NullPointerException when page.getDictionaryObject( COSName.KIDS ) returns null. I have a PDF where this actually happens but I can not provide it due to the confidential information it contains. I confirmed that once I added the null check that the code worked as expected (the documents I was merging were visible, the page count was correct, etc.). Patch will be attached momentarily.
