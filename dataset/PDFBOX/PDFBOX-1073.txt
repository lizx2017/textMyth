Summary:
Error when handling a TIFF image
Description:
There is an error in a TIFF image within a PDF document and when PDCcitt.getRGBImage() is called, there is a disparity between current PDFBox and v0.8.0. The issue is that there now TIFF decoding features whereas the older PDFBox used to hand that off to java.imageio.
The bug here isn't in the Ccitt decoder, but rather in how PDCcitt.getRGBImage() handles an error. Rather than bombing out, I have reimplemented the old feature when an error is thrown.
