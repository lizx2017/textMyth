Summary:
Regression? Type 3 Fonts are not processed by RenderUtil.convertToImage
Description:
I have a (confidential) PDF file that I wanted to check and it comes up mostly empty. It has type3 fonts. Luckily, I found two closed issues (PDFBOX-31 and PDFBOX-1628) with test images that render mostly empty.
