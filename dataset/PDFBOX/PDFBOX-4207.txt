Summary:
Coordinates shown in PDFDebugger are incorrect on HiDPI displays
Description:
On jdk9 and jdk10 the new field identification (see [ https://svn.apache.org/r1830394 ] ) doesn't work properly. This is likely related to the problems described in PDFBOX-3665. The solution is likely a transform like the one explained by Alexander.
