Summary:
org.apache.jempbox.impl.DateConverter unable to parse correct date value
Description:
In a PDF I have found the following XMP field:
xmp:CreateDate="2012-01-31T10:33+01:00"
When Jempbox try to access this field I received the following error : "Error converting date:201201311033+0100"
If we read the XMP SPECIFICATION PART 1 (http://www.adobe.com/devnet/xmp.html) in chapter "8.2.1.2 Date" the value is correct, it respect the format : YYYY-MM-DDThh:mmTZD but the DateConverter class is not able to read it.
After a quick view of the class the complete parsing method need to be rewritten.
