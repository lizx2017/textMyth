Summary:
Stack overflow error in Main (no output file produced)
Description:
When I analyse attached PDF with Preflight, it crashes with "Exception in thread "main" java.lang.StackOverflowError". Using the xml option this exception is not wrapped in an exceptionThrown element, but no output is produced at all.
To put this in perspective: the offending PDF is part of a dataset of 15,000 PDFs, and it was the only one resulting in this behaviour, so it doesn't look like a common error.
