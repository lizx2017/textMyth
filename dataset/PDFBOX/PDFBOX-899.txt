Summary:
OutOfMemoryError with PDFTextStripper
Description:
PDFBox 1.3.1 has high memory demands when stripping text from PDF files.
http://www.unicode.org/Public/5.1.0/charts/CodeCharts.pdf even crashes an application server by requiring esimated aditional 300MB+ of heap memory. The heap dump suggests that PDFStreamEngine#documentFontCache might be the root of the leaking objects.
PDFBox 1.0.0 did not show this behaviour.
