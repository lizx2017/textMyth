I have 3 suggested improvements to COSString. The
first two I'd consider bugs, the 3rd is an
enhancement. I'll attach a diff fixing all three.
1. COSString.equals compares the underlying byte
arrays, so a COSString read from a Unicode string in
a PDF file will appear different than a COSString
built programmatically, even if they contain the same
characters.
For example:
COSString s1 = new COSString(new byte[]
{ -2, -1, 0, 115, 0, 116, 0, 114}
);
COSString s2 = new COSString("str");
System.out.println(s1.equals(s2));
prints false, even though both strings consist of
just the characters 's', 't', 'r' in that order,
which I'd argue makes them the same.
2. COSString.toString just does a new String(getBytes
()), so if the bytes in the underlying byte array
form a Unicode string, it will convert every byte to
a character, including the BOM and 0's. Instead it
should call getString(), which accounts for Unicode
strings and converts using an appropriate encoding.
3. COSString.equals will only return true if the
object being compared against is another COSString.
It would be handy if it fell back to comparing
against obj.toString if the object isn't a COSString.
In particular, this would let you do things like:
if (acosstring.equals("hello"))
This would be a useful change in the other
COS*.equals methods as well, particularly with
autoboxing, as you should be able to do things like:
if (acosinteger.equals(42))
The attached diff basically runs everything through
getString(). As that could be relatively expensive, I
have getString() cache the resulting String.
