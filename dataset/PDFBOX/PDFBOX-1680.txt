Downloads Stack
Welcome to Mac OS X Snow Leopard.
The Dock in Snow Leopard
includes Stacks, which you
can use to quickly access
MYLX\LU[S`\ZLKÄSLZHUK
applications right from
the Dock.
Stacks are simple to create. Just drag any folder to
the right side of the Dock and it becomes a stack.
Click a stack and it springs from the Dock in either

Mac OS X Snow Leopard includes three premade
stacks called Documents, Downloads, and Applications
@V\VWLULK[OPZÄSLMYVT[OL+V^USVHKZZ[HJR
The Downloads stack captures all of your Internet
downloads and puts them in one convenient location.
Files you download in Safari, Mail, and iChat go

Stacks automatically display their contents in a fan or a
grid based on the number of items in the stack. You
can also view the stack as a list. If you prefer one style
over the other, you can set the stack to always open in
that style.

or you can set the sort order so that the items you care
about most always appear at the top of the stack. To
customize a stack, position the pointer over the stack
icon and hold down the mouse button until a menu
appears. Choose the settings you want from the menu.
