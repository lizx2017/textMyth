Summary:
Corners of stroked type are inaccurate when rendered as an image
Description:
Using the latest 2.0 SNAPSHOT, converting a PDF with outlined type results in slightly inaccurate strokes. It looks as if the strokes don't always meet completely causing some corners of the rendered type to have double corners.
For abc1.jpg, it's most visible on the bottom left of most rendered glyphs.
