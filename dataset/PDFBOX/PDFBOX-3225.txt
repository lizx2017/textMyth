Summary:
Please delete old releases from mirroring system
Description:
To reduce the load on the ASF mirrors, projects are required to delete old releases [1]
Please can you remove all non-current releases?
i.e. the ones listed as affected, plus 2.0.0-RC1 & RC2
Thanks!
Also, if you have a release guide, perhaps you could add a cleanup stage to it?
