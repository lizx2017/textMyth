Summary:
PDF completely blow up the RAM on amazon instances
Description:
Hi all
The issue is pretty straightforward. I receive a lot of pdfs every day and render them. In most of the cases everything is OK, but PDFs which produces 
WARN org.apache.pdfbox.pdmodel.graphics.color.PDICCBased - ICC profile is Perceptual, ignoring, treating as Display class
working super long, and are super memory consumable. 
It takes from 5 to 15 min on m5.large amazon instance. But attached PDF completely killed the instance. The java process is just killed by linux during processing with no exception in logs. 
So could you please provide explanations what is going on with files with WARN message above, and how can I improve the rendering. 
  Here is my VM options 
-Dorg.apache.pdfbox.rendering.UsePureJavaCMYKConversion=true -Xmx3G -Xms2G -Dsun.java2d.cmm=sun.java2d.cmm.kcms.KcmsServiceProvider"
Also don't hesitate to ask me about more PDF, I have tones of them
  And also a question, does GPU have influence on rendering?
