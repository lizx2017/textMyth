Summary:
Some fonts do not print
Description:
From the mailing list:
When I try to print the pdf available
here<https://www.dropbox.com/s/bb44l6r6lno4sgt/pdf_fail.pdf> there
are 2 boxes on the second page with text "CV 138" and "D946". both text are
in black boxes. When this is printed out on windows machine the text in the
2 boxes is not there but on a mac its fine. Using pdffonts command it shows
their are 3 fonts Helvetica, Helvetica-Bold and Courier that are not
embedded in the pdf. Could this be causing it?
How do I solve it so the text will be visible in the boxes?
Thank you
Regards
Joseph
