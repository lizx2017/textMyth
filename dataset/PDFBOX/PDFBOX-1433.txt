Summary:
widths[] not updated in TextPosition.insertDiacritic()
Description:
I change the TextPosition class such that protected float[] widths; instead of private because I would like to inherit this class and have access to widths. After doing that, I expect the widths[] being updated every time after insertDiacritic(). However, it is not due to
widths2[i+1] = 0;
I change it to:
widths2[i+1] = diacritic.getWidth();
I may misunderstand why this is set to zero. But what I intend to do is, to write a PageSVGDrawer so that I can convert a PDF to SVG. Every time in the processTextPosition() of my PageSVGDrawer, I detect whether the new text can be merged into the previous character to form a word or even a sentence. That's why I want to use the width of each character.
