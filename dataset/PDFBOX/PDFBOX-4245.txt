Summary:
wrong rendering of the transparency group at the specific position on a page
Description:
The rendering of the transparency groups works only if the whole page is rendered. If you try to render only a part of the page where is a transparency group placed, you will get only the white image or an image with shifted pixels representing applied soft mask. The simple fix is attached in the patch, including the test and the resources used for testing.
