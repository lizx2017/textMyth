Summary:
Elements in the structure tree are not removed or corrected when flattening

When flattening, the elements in the structure tree are not removed nor adjusted (to the form xobject). An example can be found at Root/StructTreeRoot/ParentTree/Nums/[31]/K/Obj in the file GovFormPreFlattened.pdf . This links to something that does not really exist anymore.
