When I try to run ExtractText, the output is garbage.
I'm running the latest PDFBox-0.7.3-dev-20060404 . I
run with parameters:
-encoding utf-8 jp.pdf jp.txt
Sourceforge won't let me upload a file, so here is a
URL:

I've seen another discussion thread about this issue
too. Can you explain how to enable pdfbox to work with
japanese fonts? (Are there properties that need to be
set or additional resources needed?)
