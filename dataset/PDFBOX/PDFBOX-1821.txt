Summary:
Parsing (extracting content) a single 5Mb pdf file takes 3minutes
Description:
When I try to extract the attached pdf-file with the following code:
...
PDFTextStripper stripper = new PDFTextStripper();
OutputStream os = null;
Writer writer = null;
PDDocument document = null;
File file = new File( "takes3mins.pdf" );
...
document = PDDocument.load(file );
File outFile = new File("c:/tmp/gugus.txt");
os = new FileOutputStream(outFile);
writer = new OutputStreamWriter(os);
stripper.writeText(document, writer);
...
it takes approx 3minutes. Opening it in AcrobatReader in a few seconds.
