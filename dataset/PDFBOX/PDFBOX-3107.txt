Summary:
Asterisk character not displaying properly in Adobe Reader
Description:
From Matt B. in the user mailing list:
I have an odd issue with the asterisk character not displaying properly in Adobe Reader (XI or DC)
The "*" is displayed on the document as a hollow box, all other characters seem to be ok.
I thought it was an issue with my code, so I gave it a try in the HelloWorldTTF.java example, and got the same results...with various different TTF fonts as well.
Attached is the test.pdf output file, using the LiberationSans-Regular.ttf font and input message "1*1".
It was created using a 2.0.0-SNAPSHOT that I built earlier this morning, but I also had the same results using the RC1 binaries.
