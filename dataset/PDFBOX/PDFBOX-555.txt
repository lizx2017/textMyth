Summary:
Highlight.jsp (pdfbox.war) not working
Description:
Here the Highlighter Demo (pdfbox.war) didn't work (no highlighting) until I changed the ASF comment on the top of this file into a JSP comment. Thus this comment no more appears in the result stream (which is denoted 'XML' bit in fact isn't!)
