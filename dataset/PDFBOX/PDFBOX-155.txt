When printing a pdf that contains a barcode (created in
itext) like this:
PDdocument doc=new PDdocument("test.pdf");
doc.print();
The document comes out fine, except the barcodes are
missing. Using a normal pdf reader the barcodes are
printed.
I will upload a barcode_test.pdf to ftp.pdfbox.org
Best regards,
Rene
sorry didn't know category or group :S

Thanks for your workaround mathd, i was looking for a way to print a barcode and it works.
But there is still a problem : I have to display the number associated to the barcode, in fact the number used to generate it with iText.
For example:
Image barcode39 = null;
//I create my BarCode :
String baseBarCode = "12306"
barcode=new Barcode39();
barcode.setCode(codebarre);
barcode.setStartStopText(false);
//Then I create my image
barcode39=barcode.createImageWithBarcode(cb, null, null); // this way works, but I can't print it with pdfbox
// or the second way, which works, but the size of the barcode is not the same, and the number disappears at printing
java.awt.Image img3 = barcode.createAwtImage(Color.BLACK, Color.WHITE);
Did somebody have the same problem, and is there a simple way to solve it?
For the moment, i try to found an alternative by displaying the number independantly, but it won't render the same.
Thanks
Michel

I have found a workaround if you are creating the original pdf yourself with iText.
Instead of creating the barcode with createImageWithBarcode
ex:
Image img = code128.createImageWithBarcode(cb, null, null);
img.setAbsolutePosition(150, 50);
cb.addImage(img);
I created an java.awt.Image with createAwtImage
ex:
java.awt.Image img3 = code128.createAwtImage(Color.BLACK, Color.WHITE);
Image img4 = Image.getInstance(img3, null);
img4.setAbsolutePosition(150, 50);
cb.addImage(img4);
That way the barcode is an image of a barcode and PDFBox can print it without problem.

I have the same problem with version 0.7.3
But the nightly build are able to print the pdf417 font (2d barcode) but not the regular barcode.
I am not able to upload the sample pdf to ftp.pdfbox.org so I have send you an email. If you prefer I have also upload it to http://premieresloges.ca/barcode_test2.pdf

I took a quick peek at the barcode_test.pdf file. I fixed the one exception that was thrown but then ran into another error; the barcodes were not being drawn in the correct spot. I have not had time to look at it further yet.

The news is that I am looking for a sample PDF. I don't seem to be able to find the barcode_test.pdf with my list of PDFs. If you have a sample then please attach/upload to ftp.pdfbox.org
Thanks,
Ben
