Summary:
how to access a PDoutlineNode object's parent without using its protected menthod getParent() ?
Description:
I have some java codes that depend on the getParent() method to traverse the PDOutlineNode structure. They works fine with old version of PDFBox since this method is declared as a public method. Now it is changed to protected in the new version 1.1.0. How should I make my code work without extending or subclassing PDOutlineNode?
