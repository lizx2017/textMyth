Summary:
Japanese text displayed as barcode
Description:
WARN  PDCIDFontType0:160 - Using fallback Barcode3of9-Italic for CID-keyed font STSongStd-Light
The reason is that the fonts "match" in FontMapperImpl.getFontMatches(). My barcode fonts have "0" as panose font family which means "any", and the PDF also has "any".
