Summary:
Can't draw PDFs while ANNOTS is COSStream instead of COSArray
Description:
PDFBox would failed to draw the attached document , error logs are below:
java.lang.ClassCastException: org.apache.pdfbox.cos.COSStream cannot be cast to org.apache.pdfbox.cos.COSArray
at org.apache.pdfbox.pdmodel.PDPage.getAnnotations(PDPage.java:661) ~[classes/:?]
at org.apache.pdfbox.rendering.PageDrawer.drawPage(PageDrawer.java:202) ~[classes/:?]
This PDF put COSStream as the page's ANNOTS object, and caused the failure.
Simply do type checks in PDPage.getAnnotations might avoid this issue, but the annotations would lost.
  This PDF show correctly (I mean annotation works) in:
Chrome 63.0.3239.132
Adobe Reader 11.0.23
