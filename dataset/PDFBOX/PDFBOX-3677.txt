Summary:
NullPointerException in Type1Parser.read
Description:
Text extraction from certain PDFs is not possible and PDF Box responses with NullPointerException. Text extraction from same PDF with version 1.8.13 is working.
Originally the issue was discovered while using the newest Apache Tika 1.14 library. I can not down-grade to PDF Box 1.8.13 with Apache Tika 1.14.
Unfortunately I can not provide the PDFs that fail to you. However, I did some testing and found out that “Token token = lexer.nextToken();” return Null.
