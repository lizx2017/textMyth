Summary:
PDTextStream does not support UTF16 with BOM
Description:
the getAsString() method from PDTextStream is quite useful, but it does not support UTF-16 text. I added a small check on the first two bytes to support UTF-16 content. This is needed because two-bytes encodings do not degrade gracefully like UTF-8, even for plain ASCII text and so the resulting string is unusable.
