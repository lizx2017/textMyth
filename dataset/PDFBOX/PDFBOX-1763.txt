Summary:
Exception caused by "Invalid ICC Profile Data"
Description:
Sometimes Preflight raises the exception "Invalid ICC Profile Data". Some example files that produce this problem are:
http://acroeng.adobe.com/Test_Files/fonts//printtestfont_nonopt.pdf
http://acroeng.adobe.com/Test_Files/fonts//printtestfont_opt.pdf
http://www.math.uakron.edu/~dpstory/tutorial/pdfmarks/links.pdf
I also checked these files with Acrobat's Preflight function, which reports ICC profiles that are either not valid or that follow the ICC profile 4.0 version or newer (which are only allowed in PDF 1.5 onward). It would be nice if Preflight would report these errors without raising an exception.
