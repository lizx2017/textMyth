Summary:
PDOptionalContentProperties.setGroupEnabled not working
Description:
PDOptionalContentProperties.setGroupEnabled does not work properly, because it tries to remove the wrong object from the OFF/ON dictionaries (the result of toDictionary, instead of the original object, which can be a different instance so the remove method does not find it). The attached patch fixes this issue.
