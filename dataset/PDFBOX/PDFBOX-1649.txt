Summary:
PNG images with alpha channel displays thin grey lines
Description:
When including a PNG file in a PDF file, both Adobe Reader and Google Chrome show thin grey lines. I have attached a screenshot showing the issue.
PDDocument document = new PDDocument();
PDPage page = new PDPage(PDPage.PAGE_SIZE_A4);
document.addPage(page);
BufferedImage buffImage = ImageIO.read(new File("test.png"));
PDPixelMap pixelMap = new PDPixelMap(document, buffImage);
PDPageContentStream contentStream = new PDPageContentStream(document, page);
contentStream.drawImage(pixelMap, 0, 0);
contentStream.close();
document.save(new File("test.pdf"));
This does not happen with a flattened PNG (without alpha channel).
