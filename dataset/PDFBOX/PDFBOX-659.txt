Summary:
Newlines added in the middle of words
Description:
I am experiencing issues getting the text from a PDF document. The document I want to get the text is a scientific paper.
The tool works fine, but in the title there are some problems: in the middle of some words I get a newline.
An example of what I am getting is the following text:
An
Asp
e
ct-Orien
ted
F
ramew
o
rk
for
S
ervice
A
d
aptation
rather than the expected "An Aspect-Oriented Framework for Service Adaptation".
Please let me know if I may help finding the bug
