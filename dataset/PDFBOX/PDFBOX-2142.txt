Summary:
some /ICCBased colorspaces not rendered correctly
Description:
I have created a test file from PostScript to show that CIELAB and XYZ some colors are different when rendered by PDFBox.
Btw the RGB colors in the file have no meaning, nor do the colors have a relationship between each others, i.e. they do not have to look identical to any other color anywhere.
The postscript file was created based on files by James Cloos.
