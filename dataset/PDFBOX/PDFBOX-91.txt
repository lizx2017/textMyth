i have a problem with form text fields when the option
"comb of x characters" is enabled.
One defines, how many letters should be placed inside
the text field and the
letters will all have the same distance between each
other. I need this option
because i have several fixed-length input fields and need
to place the letters
on the correct positions.
an examlpe of the template-pdf placed at
pdfboxexample_before.pdf
when filling the form fields with pdfbox everyting works
fine, but the comb-option
gets almost lost. the output pdf does not display the
form fields correctly,
the comb-option seems to be activated when focussing
one form field and deactivated
on leaving that field. the fields are not read-only, so one
can edit them in
the output-pdf also. when doing that, the comp-options
comes back and the letters
stay in place when leaving the form field.
an example of the output-pdf is placed at
pdfboxexample_after.pdf

hi folks,
just for info:
might be the same problem as described in bug 1118054
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1118054&group_id=78314&atid=552832
the form field is not displayed as it should be, happens
with different fonts or attributes (my problem), happens
with rotated fields in a usual page (barcode problem of
_daniel) and happens with usual fields on a rotated page. It
simply seems to be a problem that form fields are displayed
wrong if some parameter is not set to default.
i'd like to know if the form field changes it's way of
being
displayed when setting the cursor into the field. this
usually happens with fields described in the other bug.
see ya
