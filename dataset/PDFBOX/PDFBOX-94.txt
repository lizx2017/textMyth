This bug reopens bug number 1261555:
The attached pdf document produces a "Unexpected end of
ZLIB input stream" exception when trying to extract the
text for example. My environment is WindowsXP.
It looks as if the Inflater in
InflaterInputStream.read() method does not recognize
that the stream is finished and tries to read/fill the
next bytes from the input stream, which is empty. I
don't know if the file is just corrupt, but I found a
lot like this one and Acrobat Reader seems to handle it.
The workaround described in bug 1261555 seems to work
but is not really nice.
cheers
Yves
