Summary:
Filled form fields appear gray instead of black after flatten
Description:
Hi,
I'm facing the following issue: When filling out an acrobat form and flattening it, the text color in the resulting pdf is gray instead of black.
I attached the input.pdf and several output files for different pdfbox versions. Using pdfbox 2.0.2, I get the expected result with black text, as from version >=2.0.3 the text is gray.
Code:
public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
    PDDocument doc = PDDocument.load(new File("input.pdf"));
    PDAcroForm form = doc.getDocumentCatalog().getAcroForm();
    form.getField("Text1").setValue("value");
    form.getField("Text2").setValue("value");
    form.getField("Text3").setValue("value");
    form.flatten();
    doc.save("output.pdf");
}
The default appearance for every text field is set to something like /Helv 0 Tf 0 g. Our current workaround is to replace 0 g with 0 0 0 rg. But in my understanding, they both should yield the same result.
Thanks in advance.
