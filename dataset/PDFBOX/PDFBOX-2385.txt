Summary:
inline image with EI at the end incorrectly parsed
Description:
I'm having a look at the files from TIKA-1419 where there's a big decrease in the token count. And I found another problem with inline images. This time, the file is like this:
ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffEI
Q
Because of the first change in PDFBOX-2163, PDFBox assumes that this is Ascii85 code but it isn't. From my own tests, deleting the "Ascii85" test [ http://svn.apache.org/r1606177 ] and keeping the second change [ http://svn.apache.org/r1613645 ] (expecting spaces, 1-3 chars, blanks) works fine.
I will have a look at some of the files (those with big token count decrease) mentioned in Tim Allisons csv file over the next few days / weeks.
