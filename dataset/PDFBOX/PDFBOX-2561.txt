Summary:
Rendering of PDIndexed line incorrect
Description:
Page 4 of the attached file ( http://www.jagpdf.org/doc/samples/jagpdf_doc_color_spaces.pdf , linked from http://www.jagpdf.org/doc/jagpdf/usersguide/graphics.htm ) has three colors that are rendered incorrectly. The initialization is correct, however toRGB() gets passed float values that are indices, i.e. 0.0, 1.0, 2.0, so it is wrong to multiply them with 255.
See also PDFBOX-1997 and [ https://svn.apache.org/r1607674 ] which had a similar problem.
Before committing I'll first run my test suite.
