Summary:
Border settings are not honored on some PDF documents
Description:
I'm using PDFBox to create a PDF rendering plug-in for Eclipse. I noticed that my plug-in does not honor the border settings of certain documents and renders them in the bottom-left corner (with no space whatsoever between the document text/graphics and the bottom-left corner of the image canvas). Those same documents, however, render correctly when I view them in Adobe Reader or Apple's Preview application.
I was able to reproduce the same faulty behavior with PDFToImage, so I assume that this problem has nothing to do with my plug-in code. Rather than attaching some example documents, I'd rather provide some links (they're public income tax documents anyway):
http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040sce.pdf (this document renders correctly)
http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw4.pdf (this document renders incorrectly, without proper borders)
Let me know if you need any further information to properly diagnose this bug.
