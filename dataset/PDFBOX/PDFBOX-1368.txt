Summary:
Xmp validation KO if there are complex type in a seq element
Description:
Hi,
I updated my local repository with the last revision of the XMPBox.
I encounter a validation issue on five PDF/A that were valid before.
In attachment, there are the XMP stream.
The XMPBox parser expects a text content in a <rdf:seq><rdf:li> element, but in this XMP there are a rdf:Description as content.
BR,
Eric
