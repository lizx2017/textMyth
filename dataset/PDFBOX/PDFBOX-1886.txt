Summary:
Merge Function strips OCR layer in acrobat
Description:
We use the PDFMergerUtility to add cover pages to documents automatically. We're finding that when we do so, it strips the OCR data from the source of the merged files.
        PDFMergerUtility merger = new PDFMergerUtility();
        File outputFile = File.createTempFile();        merger.setDestinationStream(new FileOutputStream(outputFile));
        for (File file : files) {
            merger.addSource(file);
        }
        merger.mergeDocuments();
        return outputFile;
