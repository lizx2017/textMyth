Summary:
LZW EarlyChange parameter isn't supported
Description:
The image in the attached PDF can't be decoded (IndexOutOfBoundsException), The reason is that the EarlyChange decode param is set to 0:
An indication of when to increase the code length. If the value of this entry is 0, code length increases are postponed as long as possible. If the value is 1, code length increases occur one code early. This parameter is included because LZW sample code distributed by some vendors increases the code length one code earlier than necessary. Default value: 1.
