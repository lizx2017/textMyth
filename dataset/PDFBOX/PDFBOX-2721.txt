Summary:
Invalid ToUnicode CMap in font
Description:
Attached PDF file works fine in Adobe Reader, but PDFBox logs warnings:
2015-03-20 15:48:57,573 WARN [org.apache.pdfbox.pdmodel.font.PDFont] (http-0.0.0.0-8080-7) Invalid ToUnicode CMap in font HPDFAA+Thoth-Unicode
It seems that you require "beginbfchar" or "beginbfrange" in CMap. But should it be required?
CMap definition contains "beginnotdefrange" and this is ignored in PDFBox.
PDF Reference says:
beginnotdefchar, endnotdefchar, beginnotdefrange, and endnotdefrange
define notdef mappings from character codes to CIDs. As described in the
section “Handling Undefined Characters” on page 355, a notdef mapping is
used if the normal mapping produces a CID for which no glyph is present in
the associated CIDFont.
