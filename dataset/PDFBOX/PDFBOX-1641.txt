Summary:
Parsing of PDFs fails when no '<<' between directory objects
Description:
PDF's that are missing << between two COS directory objects are failing with parsing.
E.g.
>>
endobj
2 0 obj
>>
endobj
5 0 obj
<<
The fix for handling these situations is adding under 20 lines of code to BaseParser.java (which I'd like to contribute).
