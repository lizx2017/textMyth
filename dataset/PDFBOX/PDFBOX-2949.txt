Summary:
Rendering to ARGB brings black background
Description:
As reported by Jon Wu in the user mailing list... instead of the somewhat long thread, here's code I tried:
try (PDDocument document = PDDocument.load(new File(dir, "dora.pdf")))
        {
            PDFRenderer pdfRenderer = new PDFRenderer(document);

            BufferedImage bim = pdfRenderer.renderImageWithDPI(0, 300, ImageType.RGB);
            ImageIO.write(bim, "png", new File(dir, "dorargb.png"));
            bim = pdfRenderer.renderImageWithDPI(0, 300, ImageType.ARGB);
            ImageIO.write(bim, "png", new File(dir, "doraargb.png"));

        }
PDFRenderer has this:
        Graphics2D g = image.createGraphics();
        if (imageType != ImageType.ARGB)
        {
            g.setBackground(Color.WHITE);
        }
We could just remove the line with the "if" and the braces. The question is, is the current behaviour a fault or a feature? Note that the ARGB image has a detail that is invisible in the RGB image.
