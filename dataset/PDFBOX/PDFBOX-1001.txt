Summary:
TextPosition.getHeight() returns erroneous value for some PDFs
Description:
For a PDF that worked fine under 1.2.1 the height value returned is negative and the wrong value (i.e. using Math.abs() won't fix it). Other PDFs work fine.
PDF Debug shows "Creator:Crystal Reports" and "Producer:PDF-XChange (XCPRO30.DLL v3.30.0064) (Windows 2k)"
And when examining the 'Stream' items, the text is not what displays.
Any suggestions on what to look for so that I can do differential analysis against other PDFs to see what they do/not have in common with this one?
(It's client data so I can't post the PDF. )
It's stopping us from moving off 1.2.1 (and later versions fix another issue we have of seeing question marks instead of the actual characters).
