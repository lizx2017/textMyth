Summary:
Debugger file open dialog has incorrect filter on Mac
Description:
The file open dialog for Mac in the PDFDebugger tool has the file filter set up incorrectly. Instead of filtering the filename, it is filtering the directory name. Thus you can open any file in a directory that ends with .pdf, but nothing else.
