Summary:
Content outside the MediaBox should not be rendered
Description:
From the PDF spec ( http://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/PDF32000_2008.pdf page 628):
"The crop, bleed, trim, and art boxes shall not ordinarily extend beyond the boundaries of the media box. If they do, they are effectively reduced to their intersection with the media box."
The attached file has the following characteristics:
MediaBox: [18.0,20.592,630.0,812.88]
CropBox: [0.0,0.0,648.0,1043.0]
TrimBox: [0.0,0.0,648.0,1043.0]
BleedBox: [0.0,0.0,648.0,1043.0]
In Adobe Reader, the "Do Not Print" section above the MediaBox does not display, but when using pdfbox it does.
