Summary:
convertToImage causes JVM crash on certain PDFs
Description:
I'm evaluating PDFBox and as part of the process I tried out several PDFs on it. One of the issues I found was on converting certain PDFs to images, it crashed the JVM with this message (Ubuntu Lucid Lynx 64-bit):
#
# A fatal error has been detected by the Java Runtime Environment:
#
#  SIGSEGV (0xb) at pc=0x00007fe5b6be1a37, pid=2133, tid=140628023412496

Of course, this seems like an issue with Java but it would be nice if PDFBox somehow worked around it. I tested this on 2 separate 64-bit Linux boxes as well as a 32-bit Windows box. Pretty much the same error on both platforms.
