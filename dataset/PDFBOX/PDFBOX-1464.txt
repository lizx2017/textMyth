Summary:
unnecessary linear searches in "CFFParser.Format0FDSelect.getFd"
Description:
The problem appears in PDFBox 1.7.1 and in revision 1415855. I
attached a two-line patch that fixes it.
In method "CFFParser.Format0FDSelect.getFd", the linear search over
the map keys "keys" is unnecessary when the "Map charString" does not
contain the key. The attached patch first checks if the map contains
the key, which is a fast operation for a LinkedHashMap like
"charString".
Moreover, I think the linear search can be avoided altogether by
storing the indices directly in the Map (the type of the values would
change from byte[] to the pair <byte[],index>).
