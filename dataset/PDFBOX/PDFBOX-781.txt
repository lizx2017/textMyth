Summary:
PDFBOX 1.2.1 Text parsing issue
Description:
Hi,
Thanks a lot for PDFBOX.
I have been using pdfbox 1.2.1 for text parsing.I have customized my Text parsing class by extending PDFTextStripper class.
The issue is : Though i am able to get all required string data (such as x/y position,width ,height,font name,font size) , the text that is extracted using Textposition object's getCharacter() returns the full text line except for the last charater.This last character appears as next line text.
Ex: (Line in PDF ): "My name is Mahesh"
(Parsed data): "My name is Mahes"
"h"
Please help me in this regard.
