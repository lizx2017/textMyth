Summary:
Checkout fails on PasswordSample-128bit.pdf because of Virus scanner
Description:
I wanted to checkout the current PDFBox SNAPSHOT but the file /trunk/pdfbox/src/test/resources/org/apache/pdfbox/encryption/PasswordSample-128bit.pdf cannot be checked out (because of the virus scanner??? - same for PasswordSample-40bit.pdf)
Can you ensure that the files are virus free? SVN error is svn: E175013
