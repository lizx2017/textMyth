Summary:
PDFMergerUtility seems to leave source file open
Description:
Hi,
  Having migrated from 2.0.11 to 2.0.12. I am facing the following issue:
  When merging multiple pdf files into one, I can no longer delete the source files.
  Here is a sample code (worked in 2.0.11):
  public void mergePDFFiles(List<File> inFiles, File outFile)
    throws InvalidPasswordException, IOException
    {
        try (OutputStream out = new BufferedOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(outFile))) {
            PDFMergerUtility merger = new PDFMergerUtility();
            merger.setDestinationStream(out);
            for(File toMerge : inFiles) {
                merger.addSource(toMerge);
            }
            merger.mergeDocuments(MemoryUsageSetting.setupMainMemoryOnly());
        }
    
        for(File f : inFiles) {
            // IOException thrown
            FileUtils.forceDelete(f);
        }
    }
Has something changed or do I do something wrong ?
  Br,
  David Schreck
