PDFImageWriter imageWriter = new PDFImageWriter();
boolean success = imageWriter.writeImage(document, imageFormat, password, startPage, endPage, outputPrefix, imageType, resolution);
if (!success)
{
  logger.error( "Error: no writer found for image format '" + imageFormat + "'" );
         System.exit(1);
