Summary:
Rendering of pattern colorspace fails
Description:
I was trying to print a pdf which was generated by iText v2.1.5. Unfortunately parts of it were printed in white â€“ the filling color was missing. I could reduce the problem to the attached PDF. When trying to print with e.g. PDocument.silentPrint I get the following info message:
[INFO] [org.apache.pdfbox.pdfviewer.PageDrawer] ColorSpace Pattern doesn't provide a non-stroking color, using white instead!
