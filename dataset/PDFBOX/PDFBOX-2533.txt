Summary:
Poor rendering with non-sequential parser
Description:
p39 + 40 of the attached file are poorly rendered with the non-Sequential parser. With the old parser, while the glyphs are not perfect, they represent the correct character. This is for 1.8.8.
In 2.0 the rendering is incorrect, but I didn't test with the old parser because that one is no longer available from the command line.
