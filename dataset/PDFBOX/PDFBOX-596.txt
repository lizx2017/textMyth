Summary:
PDActionURI: invalid getBase()
Description:
PDActionURI has a getBase() method which does not belong here. Instead it must go to a URI dictionary. Additionally the PDDocumentCatalog's getURI method currently returns PDActionURI instead of an object wrapping an URI dictionary. I'll provide a patch later.
