Summary:
Problem in COSWriter.visitFromDictionary() method with signature dictionnary entries
Description:
I was unable to save my signed PDF because the COSWriter.visitFromDictionary() method is expected a specific order for entries of the signature dictionnary.
COSName.CONTENTS entry is expected before COSName.BYTERANGE, if not, the 'reachedSignature' boolean is not correctly setted
The order shouldn't be considered since entries of the signature dictionnary are not ordered
Thank you for considering this problem.
