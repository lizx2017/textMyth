Summary:
unreading of trailing content after 'endobj' is missing new line byte (fix included)
Description:
I have several journal PDFs where the last xref section starts like
endobj xref
0 92
0000000000 65535 f
0000000044 00000 n
in this cases the PDF parser reads the endobj line completely and unreads " xref".
However the newline (in this case ^D) is lost. This is already documented in the
method readline() within PDFParser:
"Note: if you later unread the results of this function, you'll
need to add a newline character to the end of the string."
Currently I get an error like: "expected='obj' actual='655'" because the 'xref' is read as 'xref0'.
The fix:
in PDFParser insert before line 579 (the unreading of trailing characters after 'endobj') the lines:
// add a space first in place of the newline consumed by readline()
pdfSource.unread( SPACE_BYTE );
thus we get:
if (endObjectKey.startsWith( "endobj" ) )
{ /* * Some PDF files don't contain a new line after endobj so we * need to make sure that the next object number is getting read separately * and not part of the endobj keyword. Ex. Some files would have "endobj28" * instead of "endobj" */ // add a space first in place of the newline consumed by readline() pdfSource.unread( SPACE_BYTE ); pdfSource.unread( endObjectKey.substring( 6 ).getBytes("ISO-8859-1") ); }
