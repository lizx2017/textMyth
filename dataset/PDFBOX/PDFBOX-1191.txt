Summary:
Lost information while extracting images from pdf scanned by XEROX
Description:
I've got an application that get's a pdf scanned by several scanners, I'm currently having a problem with pdfs scanned by XEROX WorkCentre. The problem persists while we set the scanner to use JBIG2. If we change the printer's configuration, the image extraction does not lose information. As we have a lot of printers, and they access the application via webservice, it would be necessary to handle the issue from the application and not from every particular scanner.
Thanks
