Summary:
PDFDebugger: JComboBox does not take generic parameters in Java 1.6
Description:
In the pdfbox-debugger/StreamPane.java:168 you are using generics with a JComboBox.
This causes a compile error when targeting JDK 1.6, as JComboBox does only take a generic parameter since 1.7 AFAIR. I assume that this code will not run on JDK 1.6, you may get it to compile with a JDK 1.7+ - but at least JDK 10 complains about this when compiling.
