Summary:
ZapfDingbats not finding a substitute in Windows 8.1 Pro
Description:
When running PDFBox on Windows 8.1 Pro, it can't find a proper substitute for ZapfDingbats.
This email chain from the mailing list talks about this problem but the fix doesn't work for me:

I was able to fix this problem by adding "MS-PGothic" to the substitutes Array for ZapfDingbats (FontMapperImpl.java).
