Summary:
Dashed line with incorrect line cap
Description:
The dashed lines of p.9, 10 and 11 of the PDFBOX-1917 file look different in 1.8 and in 2.0. IMHO, they look better in 1.8, however after debugging I found out that 2.0 is correct. I found a place in 1.8 where a BasicStroke object is initialized with "default values", and looking at the java source code it is a square cap, and that is incorrect, it must be a BUTT cap.
