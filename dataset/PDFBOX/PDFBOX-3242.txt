Summary:
Problem displaying document created by PDFBox 2.0RC3 in Acrobat Reader
Description:
As reported by John Liston in the user mailing list:
A document generated using PDFBox 2.0.0-RC3 cannot be read fully by the latest version of Adobe Acrobat Reader, which says "An error exists on this page. Acrobat may not display the page correctly. Please contact the person who created the PDF document to correct the problem." The identical document created using PDFBox 1.8.11 reads in Acrobat Reader just fine. After using Acrobat Pro to increase the width of the bounding box around the first page text "Can this amount change after closing?", the rest of the text on the page showed up. The same problem showed up with other text on the following pages. Both documents read and display properly using PDFBox PDFDebugger.
Files from 1.8 and 2.0RC3 are attached. Analysis showed one bug that has already been fixed (PDFBOX-3240). The other bug is that everywhere where there's an "n n n sc" command,
/DeviceRGB cs 
is missing before except the first time it is used. Inserting it makes it work again. PDF-Tools also complains about an incorrect number of operators if the colorspace isn't set.
In 1.8 different operators are used (rg instead of sc).
