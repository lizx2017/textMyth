Summary:
fix getHashObjectIdentifier in TSAClient
Description:
TSAClient.java asks for the ASN1ObjectIdentifier of "SHA-394". What is really meant is "SHA-384". "SHA-394" is the model number of a chinese centre-pull hand towel dispenser.
I also found the correct object identifiers in various places within Bouncy Castle code and will insert them.
