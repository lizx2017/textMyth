Summary:
PDPageDestination page index off by one
Description:
When creating a new bookmark with the same page number as an existing bookmark, the resulting destination is offset by 1 compared to the old destination.
This results in the bookmark being set for the next page, which could be a non-existing page.
I've added a class with an example pdf and my own output pdf. Run with argument of a path to where you have the pdf, including a trailing slash.
