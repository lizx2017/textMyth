After using PDFBox/examples/fdf/SetField.java to set a
field in a pdf and saved it, the text does not printed
from the saved pdf. The text is in the pdf. Verified
with PrintFields.java. Also if you go to the updated
field in the pdf and click on it the text appears. If I
add text to the end of the field using Acrobat, then
the text is printed. Have verified the field in the pdf
is not readonly. Was not able to determine the meaning
of the FieldFlags. Here is the output from a modified
PrintFieldshttp://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/infomg
--1_FROM_Include_ZIP_Code.1_FROM_Include_ZIP_Code =
COSString {boo foobar this is a test to see what happens when it if very long}
fieldFlags=8392704 required=false
readOnly=false

I got them, just have not had a chance to look at them yet.
The FTP site is a write only site, so you can upload but not
download. There are a lot of users that want to send me a
PDF but would prefer not to make it publicly available.

Here are links to the pdf that I used.
http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/infomgt/forms/eforms/dd1149.pdf

I tried to download the files from ftp.pdfbox.org to test on
a different machine, but did not have permission. Thought
you might be having a similar problem

I uploaded 2 file to ftp.pdfbox.org. dd1149.pdf and
457employeeinformationchangeform.pdf. I am having the
problem with dd1149.pdf (or I am missing something). When I
bring the file up in Acrobat the From field does not display
any text. If I click on the field, the text appears. Same
thing happens when I click on the Highlight fields checkbox.
When I print, the From field is blank. Does not matter if it
is displayed on the screen or not.
Now why I might be missing something. With the
457employee*.pdf file I am not having the same problem.
Thanks,
eric

I think the URL to the PDF got cut off. Can you try again, or
upload to ftp.pdfbox.org
Thanks,

I can send the pdf, if that would help. I don't see a way to
attach it to this bug.
