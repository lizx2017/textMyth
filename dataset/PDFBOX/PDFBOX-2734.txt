Summary:
Can't create PDF with DeviceN colorspace
Description:
Reported by Floris in the user mailing list. His PDF didn't have the attributes:
6 0 obj
<<
/Cs1 /DeviceGray
/Cs2 /DeviceN
 >>
endobj
Reasons:
local array overwrites base array
getCOSObject returns name instead of array
setAttributes inflates the array too much (likely accidentally introduced in rev 1429524)
PDF after the fix:
6 0 obj
<<
/Cs1 /DeviceGray
/Cs2 [/DeviceN [/Cyan /Magenta /Yellow /Black /Orange /Green]
 /DeviceCMYK 8 0 R 9 0 R]
>>
endobj
One of the bugs is also in the trunk, I will test this later.
