Summary:
Parsing of a Type1 font fails with a NumberFormatException
Description:
When rendering the attached PDF, parsing of a font fails with a NumberFormatException. Many NullPointerExceptions and "missing fonts" are being reported then. The PDF rendered fine in our modified 1.7.x where fonts were read using AWT. I did not try with current 1.8.x. Stack traces are attached.
Note: This is just a file from my test suite, not a production problem. I am not sure whether the parser or the PDF is wrong, but the fact that it renders fine in Acrobat and in 1.7.x indicates that the former is true. The offending font is F2, if I catch and ignore the runtime exception in PDResources#getFonts() then it is reported as missing in the PageDrawer.
