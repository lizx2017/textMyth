Summary:
Direct JPEG extraction results in invalid images in 2.0.0 releases.
Description:
When I run pdfbox-app ExtractImages on a PDF containing an image with a DeviceRGB colorspace, the resulting JPEG file is very large (5.3MB, while the source PDF is 320KB).
I see this with the 2.0.0-RC2 release, I also encounter the problem with a build from today's trunk.
If I modify the code to force usage of ImageIO, a valid JPEG file results.
The image extracts properly in the 1.8.10 version.
