Summary:
Confusing download page
Description:
The download page refers to both PGP signatures as well as .asc files.
Links to the ,asc files use PGP as the visible link text.
It's not immediately obvious that these are the same thing.
It might be better to refer to the as ASC/.asc throughout (the files themselves must have the .asc suffix).
