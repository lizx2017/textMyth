Summary:
Use unfiltered stream in gouraud shadings
Description:
Gouraud shadings calls getFilteredStream(), it should call getUnfilteredStream(). This bug didn't make trouble until now, because all the streams didn't have filters. In PDFBOX-1915, several PDFs have appeared that have encoded streams.
