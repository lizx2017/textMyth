Summary:
Regression on this file as a result of PDFBOX-3446 fix
Description:
This file was parsed correctly in old versions, both 1.8.* and 2.0.2
In 2.0.4 parsing gets an Exception
at org.apache.pdfbox.pdfparser.COSParser.parseXref(COSParser.java:320)
org.apache.pdfbox.pdfparser.PDFParser.initialParse(PDFParser.java:194)
which is apparently due to the change for PDFBOX-3446.
This file clearly has something amiss, re-saving it from Acrobat makes the problem go away. But it was working fine in the older versions. FWIW the file was redacted by an unknown PDF editor in January 2015.
