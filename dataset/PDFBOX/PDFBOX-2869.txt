Summary:
Corruption in ScratchFileBuffer
Description:
Under some specific circumstances, ScratchFileBuffer can get corrupted when reading.
These circumstances are, when the completely written buffer length is a multiple of 4080, and the read(byte[], int, int) method is used to read till the end of the buffer.
Each page contains 4080 bytes. The last 8 bytes are a pointer to the next page. This next page pointer is only written if the next page is needed, not if the page is full but no further pages are needed.
The bug is in the read(byte[], int, int) method which, after reading all bytes from a page, tries to move to the next page, regardless of whether or not there is actually a next page.
The read(byte[], int, int) method must be changed to only read the next page pointer if the end of buffer is not reached.
