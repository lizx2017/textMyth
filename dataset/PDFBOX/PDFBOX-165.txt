Hello,
I'm trying to embbed several PDF files (1.6- with XFA
form inside) in a single PDF container (1.6 - with XFA
form inside).
The first time, if I embbed a PDF file with PDFBox and
reopen later the resulted file in Acrobat, all works good.
File1 + Attachment1 + Attachment2-->File2
File 2 contains Attachment1 + Attachment2 --> OK
But if I retry to attach an additional attachment to
the previous resulted file, if I reopen the generated
PDF in Acrobat, Acrobat can open it (with a warning -
"Le type de paramtre fourni par la procédure PDS est
incorrect" - Sorry, I have a french version), but the
content that is openned is the one from the first
previous first attachment I made (Attachment1) and not
the content contained in the main PDF (File1).
File2+ Attachment 3 --> File 3 corrupted PDF file .
File3 show the content of attachment 1 and contains
Attachment 2 and Attachement 3.
Is this a bug or does I make someting false?
The File is about 500Kb, so I cannot attached this to
this message.

sorry for the delay in the response, I believe this is
fixed in CVS but not yet released, please give that version
a try and let me know if you are still having an issue.
