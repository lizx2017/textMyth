Summary:
PDF supplies glyph->unicode mapping, but PDFBox doesn't use it.
Description:
We had a user report this PDF to the lucene lists: http://www.lucidimagination.com/search/document/7a8c14a534d9a84c/tika_can_not_parse_all_of_the_persian_pdf_files
I asked them to create a TIKA issue (TIKA-713) and attach the PDF file
Upon inspection, the fonts used in the PDF have custom encodings (that map the characters to U+0001, U+0002, ...), however they contain a mapping for the font to unicode >>/Type/Encoding/BaseEncoding/WinAnsiEncoding/Differences, but PDFbox doesnt use this mapping. If you use ExtractText it extracts the raw control characters instead.
