Summary:
ExtractText loses spaces when rotationMagic option is used
Description:
This was detected by looking at the result of a regression test thankfully done by Tim Allison (see at the end of PDFBOX-4371) for his work in TIKA-2779, there were many new words but some didn't have the spaces. This is the result of a bad angle (180 instead of 0), because the font matrix hasn't been considered, for type 3 fonts this is often a rotation or a flip.
