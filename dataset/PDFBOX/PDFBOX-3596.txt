Summary:
FDFDocument.loadXFDF not working
Description:
I have attached sample files that I used for testing in the external issue URL.
I am trying to read in the values of each of the fields to create a font subset, however when I try to read the value of the fields, a blank line is returned. On closer inspection, the value stored in the field is a COSName object. When I set the value manually using field.setValue the value stored is a COSString object and it works correctly.
Also, when trying to save the xfdf, the values are omitted.
Expected:
Imported XFDF values are stored as COSString objects
saveXFDF correctly outputs values.
