Summary:
TextPosition#getIndividualWidths returns negative values
Description:
I was notified by Peter Costello (peterwcostello at gmail dot com) that there has been a regression in PDFStreamSource, which results in TextPosition returning negative individual character widths. This could happen, because I only tested with TextPosition#getWidth(), but not with TextPosition#getIndividualWidths(). Below is the original message:
Bug introduced to /pdfbox/trunk/src/main/java/org/apache/pdfbox/util/PDFStreamEngine.java on revision 885904
Line 422 changed to:
float widthText = glyphMatrixStDisp.getXPosition() - glyphMatrixEndDisp.getXPosition();
Polarity of width now negative. Should be
float widthText = glyphMatrixEndDisp.getXPosition() - glyphMatrixStDisp.getXPosition();
