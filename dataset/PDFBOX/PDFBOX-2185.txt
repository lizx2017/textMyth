Summary:
Rotation and skew not applied on rectangles
Description:
When rendering the attached example, rotation and skew of rectangles is not applied properly. The reason is that the AppendRectangleToPath transform only start and end point and makes a non-rotated non-skewed result out of that. Instead, each corner of the rectangle has to be transformed separately as shown in the attached patch.
