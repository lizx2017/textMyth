Summary:
HTML output wrongly specifies UTF-16 in header
Description:
When running the command line ExtractText with the -html flag, the output file always has the following meta tag specifying UTF-16 regardless of the actual output encoding:
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset="UTF-16">
This causes editors that respect the meta tag (emacs, etc.) to garble the file content.
