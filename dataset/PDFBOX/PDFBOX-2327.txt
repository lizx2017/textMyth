Summary:
Glyph list ligatures are decomposed too early
Description:
The following code in GlyphList was moved from the Encoding class:
        DEFAULT.nameToUnicode.put("fi", "fi");
        DEFAULT.nameToUnicode.put("fl", "fl");
        DEFAULT.nameToUnicode.put("ffi", "ffi");
        DEFAULT.nameToUnicode.put("ff", "ff");
        DEFAULT.nameToUnicode.put("pi", "pi");
Which overrides the Adobe Glyph List (AGL) entries for certain ligature characters, replacing them with their decomposition. This is used by TextStripper so that it may output decomposed ligatures. However, it breaks the glyph list because the entires have been overwritten with values which are not in the AGL.
If TextStripper wants decomposed ligatures it can perform a Unicode compatibility decomposition on the output strings, alternatively it can implement this simple lookup itself, where it won't adversely impact the rest of PDFBox.
