Summary:
RenderingProblem at PDFReader
Description:
When making the PDFReader frame smaller so the PDF doesnt fit the frame the PDF is painted over the upper, lower and right margin i.e. the scrollbars and the lower panel.
Having a look at the code, I found the problem.
In all relevant methods of PDFDrawer I removed graphics.setClip(getGraphicsState().getCurrentClippingPath());
Now the PDF is rendered within the right margins.
