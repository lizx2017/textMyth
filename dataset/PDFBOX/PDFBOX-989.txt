Scale Pdf: Fit to Printable Area
Description:
Unable to scale Pdf to Fit into page.
Setting a margin and an imageable area work fine but the contents of the pdf are not scaled to fit into the printable area. This results in parts of the pdf being cut off and thus the library unusable.
PageFormat pForm = new PageFormat();
Paper paper = new Paper();
paper.setSize(594.936, 841.536);
double margin = 36; // half inch
paper.setImageableArea(margin, margin, paper.getWidth() - margin * 2, paper.getHeight() - margin * 2);
pForm.setPaper(paper);
