Summary:
Trailer Syntax error, ID is different in the first and the last trailer - for PDF with incremental updates
Description:
As reported at the users mailing list:
Hello guys,
I have the following problem using apache.pdfbox when validating a valid PDF/A-1 file, which is being signed twice:
1. The online validator confirms that the file is valid (https://www.pdf-tools.com/pdf/validate-pdfa-online.aspx)
2. But when I validate it using the following code:
PreflightParser parser = new PreflightParser(byteDatasource);
parser.parse();
PreflightDocument document = parser.getPreflightDocument();
document.validate();
result = document.getResult();
3. The file is linearized
4. I get that the file is invalid and the error description reads:
Trailer Syntax error, ID is different in the first and the last trailer</i>
According to issues PDFBOX-3256 and PDFBOX-2502 this should be fixed?
Could anyone give me a tip how to go around this problem or would that be a bug?
The pdf file is attached.
Analysis:
The original PDF is linearized with a subsequent incremental update.
According to ISO 32000-1 F1
Incremental update shall still be permitted, but the resulting PDF is no longer linearized and subsequently shall be treated as ordinary PDF. Linearizing it again may require reprocessing the entire file; see G.7, "Accessing an Updated File" for details.
as the file shall no longer be treated as linearized the provision about matching ID's as outlined in PDFBOX-2502 no longer applies.
