Summary:
Not getting location of Form-Field correct when page has landscape orientation
Description:
In my client application, I need to know the location of form fields.
For getting the location, I am relaying on those widgets of field which has non-negative page number.
  In attached Pdf File ( RPA_WTA_Extended (1).pdf ). when it changes orientation (page - 10), I could see widgets with non-negative page number was giving me improper location.
  For getting page I'm doing this:
int getPageOfWidget(PDAnnotationWidget widget, PDPageTree pages)
{
   return pages.indexOf(widget.getPage()); 
}
