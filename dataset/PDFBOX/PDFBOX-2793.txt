Summary:
/Dests dictionary isn't supported
Description:
I have received a non public file that has a /Dests dictionary in the /Catalog, and this is not supported by PDFBox. This is a concept from PDF 1.1 that is no longer used since PDF 1.2, but it is legal and not deprecated, only discouraged.
What needs to be done is to include an additional lookup in PDOutlineItem.findDestinationPage() in the PDNamedDestination section. And an additional getter in PDDocumentCatalog, and a new class to encapsulate that "dictionary of names and corresponding destinations".
