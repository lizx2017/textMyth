Summary:
Possible errors in TrueType table 'name' parsing.
Description:
Accidentally noticed a possible bug in parsing name records:
1) Class NamingTable.java, line 165:
for (int i = 4; i <= 0; i--)
this loop is never entered, thus, Unicode strings are not considered.
2) Class NamingTable.java, line 106:
String string = data.readString(nr.getStringLength(), charset);
for platform == 0 (Unicode), strings are read in ISO-8859-1 charset, but most likely it should be UTF16 charset.
This may affect values of the FontFamily and FontSubFamily fields.
