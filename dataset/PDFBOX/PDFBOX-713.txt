Summary:
PDFont fails to close Font File.
Description:
Findbugs Reported this problem.
I have include a patch which closes the file.
BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(fontFile.getUnfilteredStream()));
Bug: org.apache.pdfbox.pdmodel.font.PDFont.getEncodingFromFont() may fail to close stream
Pattern id: OS_OPEN_STREAM, type: OS, category: BAD_PRACTICE
The method creates an IO stream object, does not assign it to any fields, pass it to other methods that might close it, or return it, and does not appear to close the stream on all paths out of the method. This may result in a file descriptor leak. It is generally a good idea to use a finally block to ensure that streams are closed.
