Summary:
Fonts not printed on HP laserjet (1320 & 8150) when having landscape orientation
Description:
When printing the attached file on either of the two mentioned printers, only empty rectangles were printed.
The Text was visible on the PDFReader preview, but was missing in the printout.
After having read http://netstripe.com/info/appnote/app_031.html, I changed the code to rotate the page instead
of the font. Now the text is printed correctly. I will provide my changes if needed.
