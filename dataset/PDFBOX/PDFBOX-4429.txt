Summary:
Bogus /StructParent(s) entries are kept when merging with file that has a structure tree
Description:
Some files have /StructParent(s) entries but no structure tree. When these are merged with a file that has a structure tree, a subsequent checkWithNumberTree() test will fail. So there should be a cleanup. This is important mostly for testing of merging random files.
