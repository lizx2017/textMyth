Summary:
Memory leak in preflight
Description:
PreflightParser has this:
    public PreflightParser(DataSource dataSource) throws IOException
    {
        // TODO move file handling outside of the parser
        super(new RandomAccessBufferedFileInputStream(dataSource.getInputStream()));
        this.setLenient(false);
        this.originalDocument = dataSource;
    }
The TODO message looks like a design issue, but it is much worse: the RandomAccessBufferedFileInputStream is never closed, which results in the temp file not being deleted. The file parameter constructor has the same problem, i.e. that the RandomAccessBufferedFileInputStream object is not closed (no temp file there).
