Summary:
PDFBox treats some DeviceRGB pdfs as DeviceGRAY
Description:
Some PDF files are correctly processed by PDFBox as DeviceRGB and the font color can be retrieved. Other DeviceRGB files that can be viewed by Acrobat Reader as fonts with various colors are treated as DeviceGray by PDFBox. An example of creating such a file which is listed as DeviceGray is with Word 2010 and then saving as using the MinimumSize option. An example of creating a file which is recognized by PDFBox is to save Standard. I believe either case should be recognized as DeviceRGB
