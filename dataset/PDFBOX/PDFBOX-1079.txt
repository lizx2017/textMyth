Summary:
TestCOSFloat occasionally fails: Is something wrong with my machine?
Description:
In org.apache.pdfbox.cos.TestCOSFloat, testEquals() fails when num is close to 1.0f.
I originally encountered the problem as an occasional failure while building the unmodified source code.
I can get the failure consistently by setting num to 1.0f explicitly in the code and running the test.
The problem occurs on this line, on the last iteration of the loop, when i is 280000f and num is close to 280000f.
COSFloat test4 = new COSFloat(num + 0.01f);
It passes consistently on my machine if I change this value to 0.02f.
