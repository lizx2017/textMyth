Summary:
Indexed images are sometimes corrupted when encrypting the PDF
Description:
While PDFBOX-99 did fix this problem with some images, it did not solve the problem in 100% of the cases. I'll be attaching a file which demonstrates the problem and I plan on fixing this once I figure out what's going awry.
