Summary:
Invalid memory access of location 00000000 eip=968f5aa7 (MAC OS X)
Description:
Hi,
when I open the document test.pdf (attached to this issue) the application crashes and throws errors.
In the Debugger I can see the following message at the end:
Invalid memory access of location 00000000 eip=968f5aa7
In the logfile there are some errors like:
22.06.2009 16:17:26 org.apache.pdfbox.util.operator.SetNonStrokingColor process
WARNUNG: Not supported colorspace Pattern within operator scn
22.06.2009 16:17:26 org.apache.pdfbox.pdmodel.graphics.color.PDColorSpaceInstance createColor
SCHWERWIEGEND: java.io.IOException: Not implemented
or
22.06.2009 16:17:26 org.apache.pdfbox.util.operator.pagedrawer.FillNonZeroRule process
WARNUNG: Not implemented
I get the error with Java 5 and 6.
On a Windows machine the error doesn't occur.
Other PDFs are working expect the one that I mentioned in issue PDFBox-484 where I have some display problems.
Does someone know a workaround for this "Invalid memory access" error?
Regards
Marco
