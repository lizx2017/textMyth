Summary:
Wrong appearance generation for rotated AcroForms fields
Description:
When filling a PDF field that is rotated the resulting generated PDF has the correct format. But when you generate an image of the PDF the image has the text in those rotated fields as not rotated.
I have tried a variety of templates and they all do the same thing: view the preview of the PDF and see unrotated text. Open the PDF and see the correctly rotated text.
Note that I generate the same PDF using iText 5.5.9 and the preview is correct, the text is correctly rotated. I'm basically bouncing back and forth between iText and PDFBox trying to find a working solution.
If it makes any difference I'm using an FDF file to fill with iText and an XFDF file for PDFBox because I can't figure out how to load an FDF in 2.0.1.
