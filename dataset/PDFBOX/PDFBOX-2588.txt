Summary:
Text fields if initialy empty in AcroForms do not contain a COSName.V in its dictionary and therefore does not get rendered.
Description:
When filling pdf acro forms if a text field initialy does not contain a value ( is empty) then the fieldTreeNode does not set COSName.V in it's dictionary and therefore calling setValue does not update the value and does not render.
This is solved by calling
field.getDictionary().setItem(COSName.V, new COSString("some new value"));
instead of setValue. This is probobally not desired. So either add it to constructor or somewhere else. This affects the trunk version (downloaded on 5.1.2015)
