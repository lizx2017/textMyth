ContentStreamWriter.EOL is currently defined as
System.getProperty("line.separator").getBytes()
I am using PDDocument.save(OutputStream) to send the
pdf through a CheckedOutputStream for getting a
checksum for the pdf. I found that because of this use
of System.getProperty("line.separator") that my
checksums were different when this ran on different
operating systems. My workaround was to force
System.getProperty("line.separator") to a known value
before calling PDDocument.save(OutputStream) and then
resetting it after, but this is not an optimal solution.
I propose that this value be made a fixed one (which
one you pick apparently doesn't matter) as it's more
"java like" for things to be the same on different
operating systems.

Seems COSStandardOutputStream.EOL also needs a change made
as it is initialized the same way.
