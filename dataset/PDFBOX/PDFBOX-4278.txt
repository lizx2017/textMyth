Summary:
Type 3 font .notdef-named glyph missing in rendering
Description:
.notdef can lead to a valid glyph. The change in PDFBOX-2462 went too far, it is enough to check whether we can get a stream for the name. The file from PDFBOX-2462 is part of the Bavaria test set and passes after the upcoming change.
