We have a problem while extracting text from files
generated with IrisPDF, we get the following exception:
"java.io.IOException: expected='endstream'
actual='endstream13'
org.pdfbox.io.PushBackInputStream@9576fd"
Thanks in advance
Thierry Guillotin
ps: attached is an example file (as short as possible)
