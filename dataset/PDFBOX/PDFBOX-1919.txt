Summary:
Span tags are not implemented
Description:
The font descriptor flags are not set.
They are described in the document "PDF reference 1.7" at : 5.7.1 Font Descriptor Flags
The methods in PDFontDescriptor are ready but never called :
setFlags()
setSerif()
setAllCap() which is used in a lot of PDF
...
I saw some TODO that relate to that issue in the code, is it planned to be implemented soon?

UPDATE: This issue turned out to be caused by span tags and how Adobe Acrobat handles copy & paste. Ultimately the PDF contains poor quality ToUnicode mappings and poor quality span tags, so there's no real fix.
