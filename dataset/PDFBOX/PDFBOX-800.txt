Summary:
Wrong text extract from vertical textboxes in pdf files
Description:
Vertical textboxes in pdf files are not extracted correctly (using the tika library in C#).
For example if there is a vertical textbox "hello" in a pdf file (Unable to render embedded object: File (WITHOUT) not found. line breaks):
H
E
L
L
O
the parser returns 5 strings, each with a single letter, even there is NO line break after every letter.
Is there a option to avoid this problem?
