Summary:
Adobe CFF/Type2 font encoding enhancements
Description:
The application of PDFBOX-542 was accompanied with several optimizations. Later testing has revealed that one of the optimizations - the replacement of List-type field org.apache.fontbox.cff.encoding.CFFEncoding#entries with two Map-type fields #code2sid and #sid2code - may come short in situations where the mapping between codes and SIDs is not one-to-one (AFAIK, it is not covered by the CFF specification, but there are real-life examples for that).
I've compiled a patch file that restores the code in the original state.
