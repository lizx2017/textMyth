See: usage_rights_form.pdf
this is my scenario:
1. I create form with Adobe Form Designer (included in
Acrobat Professional 7).
The form is complex and has lots of JavaScript to
validate, change, and even dynamically fill data from
remote Web Service!
2. Then I add usage rights with Reader Extension
Server, so that the form can be signed with digital
signature with the free version of Reader
3. Then, place the PDF form file on a WEB server (ex.
Apache) and "give" it to the users
So far, so good! When a user fills in the form fields, he
or she submits the whole PDF file back to a server
application for further processing. In my case this app is
a Java Servlet.
What I need is to extract all the fields from the pdf file
including the digital signature.
I know that this has been discussed already, BUT the
simple code does not work. I suppose that the problem
is with the output pdf file from Form Designer.
The "not working part" is this:
PDDocument pdfDocument = PDDocument.load
(pdfFile);
PDAcroForm form = pdfDocument.getDocumentCatalog
().getAcroForm();
List flist = form.getFields();
Here in "flist" I get a single element which is null.

Hi, again. I was on a travel so the "pdf problem" was off
for a while, but now it is up and bugging me again.
Here is what I got: I have a form designed with Designer
7, which has a button of type "submit pdf". This is
because the form has a digital signature field and if I
choose "submit xml" the Sig filed is not submited. The
submit action is to a Java servlet where I dump the byte
stream to a file.
What I would like to do is get the data from each field
including the digital signature so I can validate it. The
PrintFields example works as long as the form is NOT
signed. In my case I could get the form structure but all
the fields (filed.getValue() or field.toString()) are null, and
on the digital signature the is nothing in the COS
dictionary about certificate or something.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello, I found where is the problem. When I sign and
save the document in pdf-1.6 format in the raw pdf file I
get 3 pdf forms. I guess history changes are also saved.
The first form is blank (fields/textboxes are blank/null),
the second is with values and the digital signature and
the third is the same as the second one but is saved
because (I guess again) the Submit button was pressed
and this is a change.
As I looked at the code of PDFBox more careful I
supose that the pdf box gets the first form only which in
my case is blank.
