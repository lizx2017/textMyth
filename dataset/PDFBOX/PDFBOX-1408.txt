Summary:
Width of space character is calculated wrong
Description:
PDFStreamEngine calculates width of space (line 357):
spaceWidthText = (font.getFontWidth( SPACE_BYTES, 0, 1 )*glyphSpaceToTextSpaceFactor);
In some cases the result is 0.
Problem is that getFontWidth requires code number of " ".
If there is "ToUnicode" mapping for that font that it is necessary to lookup CMap for code number and NOT to use 0x20 (space) as it is in souce code.
