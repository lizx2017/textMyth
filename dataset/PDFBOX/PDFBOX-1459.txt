Summary:
wasted work in AbstractTestAction.valid()
Description:
The problem appears in revision 1414788. I attached a one-line patch
that fixes it. This problem and the attached patch are similar the
previously fixed PDFBOX-1447 and its patch.
In method "AbstractTestAction.valid", the loop over "errors" should
break immediately after "found" is set to "true". All the iterations
after "found" is set to "true" do not perform any useful work, at best
they just set "found" again to "true".
