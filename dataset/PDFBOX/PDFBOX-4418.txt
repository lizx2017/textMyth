Summary:
ParentTree can't be merged if it has several levels
Description:
Related to fixing PDFBOX-4003 - a number tree can have several levels. Currently the merge code expects a NUMS array, but it can also have KIDS. So the code must be changed so that it uses the new convenience class to handle a number tree in full. See also code comment
//TODO this code only works with flat number trees.
// It should be a PDNumberTreeNode, but that class is broken because
// COSBase can't be instanciated and because the tree elements can
// be an array or a dictionary
