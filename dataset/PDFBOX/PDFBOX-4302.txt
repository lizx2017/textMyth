I investigated the problem and found a bug in ToUnicodeWriter class.
In writeTo method, a loop count in a operator is calculated by the following line. But the count will be 0 if the srcFrom size is just 100.
int count = batch == batchCount - 1 ? srcFrom.size() % 100 : 100;
I changed this line to below and I confirmed that the problem was resolved.
int count = batch == batchCount - 1 ? srcFrom.size() - 100 * batch : 100;
