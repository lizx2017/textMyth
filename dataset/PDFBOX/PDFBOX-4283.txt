Summary:
Allowing Rectangles with additional elements
Description:
I've come across some pages in a large PDF that have some additional, non-numerical elements at the end of the MediaBox rectangle array, e.g. 
/MediaBox [0 0 612 792 5 0 R 6 0 R]
Trying to read such a structure with PDPage.getMediaBox() throws an exception trying to construct the PDRectangle at [this line|https://github.com/apache/pdfbox/blob/6f18d7c4bef4d23a22dcf14c804d737d43908deb/pdfbox/src/main/java/org/apache/pdfbox/pdmodel/common/PDRectangle.java#L131.]
I'm not sure if this strange case should be treated as a file issue, or if should be supported by slicing / shortening the COSArray prior to trying to convert to floats. Acrobat Reader shows the pages without complaint.
The original PDF was produced by Foxit PhantomPDF Printer Version 7.3.9.0803.
