Summary:
Extract by beads doesn't work
Description:
Text extraction by beads has never worked, or (more likely) has been broken years ago, when/if the code was changed so that text positions are in image coordinates (y=0 is top) and not in PDF coordinates (y=0 is bottom).
todos:
adjust bead rectangles (done)
adjust for cropbox (done)
separate output from different beads with a newline (will open a different issue if I don't find solution)
optimize (done)
implement in 1.8.11
find a non copyrighted test file (done)
