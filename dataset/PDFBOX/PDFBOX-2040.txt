Summary:
Method PDDocument#save does not sign the document
Description:
Method PDDocument.saveIncrementally() DOES sign the document, while method PDDocument.save() does NOT sign.
It's not clear from javadoc if it's ok. At least I was frustrated. I want to sign my PDF, and it's convenient for me to use method PDDocument.save(). Could it sign the document?
