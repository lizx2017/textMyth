Summary:
Content appears a few px higher when rasterizing PDF
Description:
PDFBox seems to be off by a little bit vertically when you rasterize a PDF. This is in comparison to both Adobe's PDF library and many other PDF viewers such as Chrome's and the one in OS X.
I've attached an example PDF where there's some text with a green rectangle around it. The rectangle is has about 2x as much space above it compared to below it, but in PDFBox's raster, the rectangle is closer to the top than is is to the bottom.
This is obvious at 300 dpi but at 96 dpi it's hard to tell for sure. Anecdotally, I've noticed that when rendering text at about 74 dpi, PDFBox seems to be off by about 1px.
I've attached both a PDFBox raster and one made with Adobe's PDF library for comparison.
