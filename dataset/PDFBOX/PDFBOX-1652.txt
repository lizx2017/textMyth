Summary:
TextPosition: Japanese alphabetic characters 30fc and 3005 treated as diacritics
Description:
For the purpose of determining the position in text, the Japanese characters U+30fc (KATAKANA-HIRAGANA PROLONGED SOUND MARK) and U+3005 (IDEOGRAPHIC ITERATION MARK) are currently regarded "simple" diacritics. Apparently, they are fully-fledged characters in terms of text positioning.
This can have the effect that when extracting text, some characters get actually reversed (particularly ーン can get ンー).
A patch to fix this is attached.
