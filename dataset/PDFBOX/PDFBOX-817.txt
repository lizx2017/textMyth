Summary:
IllegalArgumentException not catched or declared while creating ICC profile
Description:
In class org.apache.pdfbox.pdmodel.graphics.color.PDICCBased.createColorSpace() the call to ICC_Profile.getInstance( profile ) might return an IllegalArgumentException. This exception is neither documented nor catched in this method (RuntimeException). Since method documentation states that an IOException is thrown if color space could not be created I would suggest catching IllegalArgumentException and wrap it in an IOException. I will add a patch to this issue.
