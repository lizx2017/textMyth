Summary:
Multiline fields won't get rendered correctly if there are multiple paragraphs in field value
Description:
I have problem with multiline fields in form filling. It seems that if i have value with newlines "\n" rendering won't work correctly. Every line seems to be rendered over previous line.
E.g.
value = "1\n2\n3\n4"
will be rendered so than every number are rendered over each other but what I'm expecting would be something like:
1
2
3
4
