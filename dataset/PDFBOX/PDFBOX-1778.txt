Summary:
Rounding issue in generated PDF file
Description:
We have PDF file which was signed by some other application.
When we try to sign it with PDFbox, previous revision is damaged.
We did some investigations and found such problem:
(question on stackoverflow is here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19903884/pdf-document-is-modified-by-another-revision/19905271?noredirect=1#19905271 )
Some PDF tags are changed in new revisions.
For example values of following tags:
/WhitePoint
/Gamma
/Matrix
are changed from values like this: 0.9505
to values like this: 0.9505000114
We think this is problem of converting float/double inside COSFloat.
Following code just opens and saves PDF file and this operation changes values of mentioned text:
public void saveTo(String sourceFile, String destFile) throws Exception{
PDDocument doc = PDDocument.load(new FileInputStream(sourceFile));
doc.save(new FileOutputStream(destFile));
}
