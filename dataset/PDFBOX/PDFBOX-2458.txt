Summary:
Signing doesn't work anymore using BC 1.51 instead of 1.50
Description:
Due to a report of David Wall on users@ signing no longer works using BC 1.51 instead of 1.50.
I'm now getting an invalid digital signature that I created on PDFs we generate (via wkhtmltopdf and PDFBox 1.8.7). It says "At least one signature is invalid" but I previously could create them with valid signatures. This occurred when going from BouncyCastle 1.50 to 1.51, and if I go back to 1.50, it works fine.
The invalid signature complains that the "Document has been altered or corrupted since it was signed".
Here's a link to an existing PDF that has an invalid signature:
