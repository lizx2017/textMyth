Summary:
Rendering problem with Java 7 update 21
Description:
Since updating to Java 1.7.0_21 converting PDFs to images is not working as it did under prior versions of Java. I'm not sure what might be causing this, but I am attaching an example one page PDF and resulting converted images that shows the effect. Basically, for some PDFs the text is no longer rendering. The sample image output was from running the PDFToImage utility on the command line with two different versions of Java.
Console output from the PDFToImage is the same from both versions of Java:
