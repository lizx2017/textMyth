Summary:
PDFont documentation correction needed for getFontWidth and getFontHeight
Description:
Andy posted this on the dev mailing list:
I can see inside the PDFont documentation for 1.8.4 and 1.8.3 there seems
to be a bit of a typo perhaps on one of the methods. The getFontWidth
method seems to be the documentation for getFontHeight.
