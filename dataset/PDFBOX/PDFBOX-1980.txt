Summary:
TestCOSFloat is non-deterministic
Description:
TestCOSFloat generates random numbers for testing which means that it is non-deterministic.
Testing COSFloat on random data doesn't achieve much, because we know what numbers look like. Even taking into account the discussion in PDFBOX-1977, I suggest that it would be better to create a set of representative data with interesting edge-cases.
