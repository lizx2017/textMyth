Summary:
Bug in org.apache.pdfbox.io.Ascii85OutputStream
Description:
There's a bug in ASCII85OutputStream.java in
public final void write(byte[] b,int off, int sz)
The effect of the bug is that buffers with length < 3 produce no output. Fix:
after
if(count < 3)
{
add this line:
flushed = false;
better: delete the whole function and let the superclass handle it. I doubt that the current implementation saves much time.
