Summary:
PDF showing white screen after certain period of time
Description:
I am running alfresco on tomcat 6.0.18... when customers are open the pdf file.. it's opening & showing the data. he minimize the pdf for certain period(20min) of time & reopen it shows that white screen in the PDF.
People are connected to Alfresco CIFS drive.. when click on the properties from the file>properties, it is not showing i.e, it is disconnecting from the server.. why pdf opened from the CIFS drive, why it is not buffering the pdf data to client location?
I got the following error in the log:
[private] ERROR [org.apache.pdfbox.pdmodel.font.PDFont] Error: Could not parse predefined CMAP file for 'Zeon-Identity-0'
Please look into this issue..

Krishna
