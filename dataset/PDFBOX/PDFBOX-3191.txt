Summary:
PDFDebugger does not handle cancelling of "Open URL" dialog
Description:
In PDFDebugger, click the menu item "Open URL..." and then cancel the dialog. A MalformedURLException caused by a NPE is thrown. After that, it is not possible to open any other file nor to close the application, since both throws a NPE in the code updating the list of last recently used files.
