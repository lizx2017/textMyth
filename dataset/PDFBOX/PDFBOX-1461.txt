Summary:
wasted work in TestIsartorValidationFromClasspath.validate()
Description:
The problem appears in version 1.7.1 and in revision 1414788. I
attached a two-line patch that fixes it. This problem and the
attached patch are similar the previously fixed PDFBOX-1447 and its
patch.
In method "TestIsartorValidationFromClasspath.validate", the loop over
"result.getErrorsList()" should break immediately after "found" is set
to "true" if "isartorResultFile" is null. All the iterations after
"found" is set to "true" do not perform any useful work when
"isartorResultFile" is null, at best they just set "found" again to
"true".
