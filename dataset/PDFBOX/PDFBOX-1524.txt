Summary:
Error with large Multipage-TIFF Files to PDF conversion
Description:
Hey Guys!
I've got an issue with PDFBox.
I want to create a PDF about, let's say, 100 pages and every page contains
an Image (I got the images from a .tiff file and decoded them to PNG).
After about fifty pages I get an OutOfMemoryException from my Java runtime and
the application terminates - do you have an idea how I get rid of this? I tried for days
to find a useable solution, but it's not that successive as I expected.
I don't want to reserve 2GiB of RAM space just for a Tiff to PDF conversion, so have
you any ideas how I could continue my work?
I already tried the .saveIncremental() methods, looked for page compression, extended the
Heapspace with -Xmx1024M and did a few other things but it still isn't working.
It'd be great to hearing from you, thank you in advance!
Regards,
Kai Oliver
