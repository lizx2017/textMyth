Summary:
Infinite loop within RandomAccessBuffer
Description:
I've found an issue with RandomAccessBuffer which is triggered in a very specific corner case only:
the buffer has more than 1 chunk
read(byte[] b, int offset, int length) is used to read the data
the data is read in portions
one of the portions to be read is identical with the last remaining bytes of the current chunk
The current implementation won't advance to the next buffer, but reads the last bytes again and again.
