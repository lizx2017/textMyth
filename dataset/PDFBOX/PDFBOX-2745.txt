Summary:
PDPageXYZDestination zoom property can't be set lower than 100%
Description:
The zoom property of PDPageXYZDestination is currently an int, which means it can't be anything that isn't a multiple of 100%, as the zoom level is measured between 0 (=0%) and 1 (=100%), or higher, not between 0 and 100.
Therefore it should be changed to a float.
