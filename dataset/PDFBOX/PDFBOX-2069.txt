I believe this because PDF streams with Tc before Tm are having the matrix applied to the Tc, which is contrary to my experience with graphic pipelines. Most PDF streams seem to to have Tc after Tm, and thus do not hit this situation.
I have attached a patch to two files that corrects the problem for this file, and also works correctly on my test suite of about 40 files from other sources.
The result for the attached file now becomes:
Text in the area:java.awt.Rectangle[x=10,y=500,width=600,height=200]
