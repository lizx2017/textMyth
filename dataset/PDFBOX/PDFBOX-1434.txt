Summary:
Font being changed after form field is set
Description:
We have encounter a problem when using pdfbox.
We have a pdf form with fields and font set to Courier (please see attached pdf file PRP.pdf).
After running the program TEstbed1.java which tries to set the value of one of the fields, font was being changed to Helvetica (please see attached pdf file forms26916.pdf).
Is there any way we can set the values and retain the original font?
