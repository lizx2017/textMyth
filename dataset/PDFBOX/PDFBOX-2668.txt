Summary:
intersectClippingPath does a shallow copy
Description:
While working on PDFBOX-2660 I discovered that PDGraphicsState#intersectClippingPath performs a shallow copy of the Area, which means that it will retain any mutation which occurs in following states.
I don't have a PDF file which is known to trigger this problem, but I've confirmed that it exists with a debugger.
