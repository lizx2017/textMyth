Description:

...
3 0 obj
<<
/EmbeddedFiles 5 0 R
>>
5 0 obj
<<
/Limits [(My first attachment) (My first attachment)]
/Names [(My first attachment) 8 0 R]
>>
...
Such PDF document opened in Adobe Acrobat does not show embedded files in attachments panel, unless "Limits" entry is removed or commented.
According to PDF3200:2008 specification (see clause "7.9.6 Name Trees") "Limits" entry in name tree node dictionary can only appear in intermediate or leaf node, but not root node.
"The tree shall always have exactly one root node, which shall contain a single entry: either Kids or Names but not both. If the root node has a Names entry, it shall be the only node in the tree. If it has a Kids entry, each of the remaining nodes shall be either an intermediate node, that shall contain a Limits entry and a Kids entry, or a leaf node, that shall contain a Limits entry and a Names entry."
