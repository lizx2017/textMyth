Summary:
setSuppressDuplicateOverlappingText sometimes removes characters that it shouldn't
Description:
The duplicate detection (in PDFTextStripper.java) checks whether the
same character was placed "nearish" to where we are about to place
another and de-dups it if so; this is to catch documents that rewind
and overwrite in order to bold word(s).
But in some cases I see it removing valid characters (that were not
dups).
