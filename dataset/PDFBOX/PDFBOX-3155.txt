Summary:
org.apache.pdfbox.util.PDFTextStripper class initialization throws NumberFormatException with recent Verona-enabled Java 9 JVMs
Description:
Lucene/Solr runs its whole testsuite also with Java 9 EA releases to trigger bugs early. In our tests (Solr + TIKA) we found out that org.apache.pdfbox.util.PDFTextStripper throws a NumberFormatException in its static initializer when parsing the "java.version" system property. The reason for failure is a change in Java 9, where version numbers got a new format.
There are 3 problems:
It should not assume that all components are really a number. So it should try/catch NumberFormatException and assign some "unknown" version
The code should really use "java.specification.version". This is standardized and only contains digits.
The code should also be prepared to handle version numbers without minor version! E.g. Java 9 only has "9" instead of "1.9" as its main version number.
For the use case I would nuke this check and find a better workaround.
Relying on String parsing for non-standardized system properties in a static class initializer is the reason why this bug is raised to level "Critical".
