Summary:
ExtractText missing most of text in this PDF file, due to font bounding box with minus infinity
Description:
Attached PDF file is missing most of the text when processed by the ExtractText example program
I traced it down to PDFontDescriptorDictionary.getFontBoundingBox() getting a rectange for COSName.FONT_BBOX that contained a ymin value of minus infinity. That method then creates a PDRectangle which calculates a bounding box with a ymin value of -65,329, and results in an enormous text size, and things go downhill from there. The text cannot be matched up, and most of it ends up being discarded.
I was able to hack a fix by doing a check in the constructor PDRectangle.PDRectangle( COSArray array ) for big negative numbers and setting them to 0. With that change, all the text came through as expected. However, I don't have enough familiarity with the code to understand what a real fix ought to look like.
The PDF file looks to be fine by other programs such as Acrobat and NitroPDF
