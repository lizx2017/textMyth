Hello,
I get a StreamCorruptedException in LZWFilter.decode
when I'm reading the Adobe-TIFF6.0 description (121
pages) file. It's a pitty but it's never more available
online. I tried to attach it, but it has ~400kb. If
anyone need's it I can mail it. I am successfull
loading it by the ICEpdf-package and Acrobat. Please
