Summary:
JBIG2Filter - FlateDecoded Globals Table
Description:
When rendering a jbig2 with a Globals table that has a filter (in this case compressed) JBIG2Filter was calling getFilteredStream which sounds correct but in fact is not filtered but the raw data. It needs to be getUnfilteredStream() .
I will submit a patch. I have a pdf to test it on but it is public so the test will have to be done off list
