Invalid Refereance exception using build PDFBox-0.7.3-
dev-20060614 against ikvm-0.28.0.0.
The following C# code causes an Invalid Referance
exception somewhere in the PDFBox DLL
PDFMergerUtility pdfMerger = new PDFMergerUtility();
pdfMerger.addSource(sTo);
pdfMerger.addSource(sFrom);
pdfMerger.setDestinationFileName(sNew);
pdfMerger.mergeDocuments();
Note: As downloaded ./external was missing
bouncycastle and lucene-demo jars
