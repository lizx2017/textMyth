Summary:
mergeDocumentsNonSeq does not utilize scratchFile
Description:
I noticed when merging relatively large pdfs (1gb) that the heap would grow by at least the same amount until complete, even when I call mergeDocumentsNonSeq() and supplying a read/write scratchfile.
When I looked at the source for mergeDocuments(bool, RandomAccess), it looks like the scratch file is never used.
private void mergeDocuments(boolean isNonSeq, RandomAccess scratchFile) 
            throws IOException, COSVisitorException
{
//...snip

                if (isNonSeq)
                {
                    source = PDDocument.loadNonSeq(sourceFile, null);
                }
//...snip
}
