Summary:
PDFont isSymbolic() has unexpected return value
Description:
From the mailing list:
Hello,
I believe the following lines should fallback to false instead of true.
https://github.com/apache/pdfbox/blob/trunk/pdfbox/src/main/java/org/apache/pdfbox/pdmodel/font/PDFont.java#L401-L402
{
// unless we can prove that the font is symbolic, we assume that it is
not
isSymbolic = true;
}
Thought to let you know.
Best Regards,
Hisham
Either the comment or the return value is wrong, but this code is very brittle so we'll need to do lots of regression testing if any changes are made.
