Summary:
DateConverter.toCalendar doesn't clear milliseconds field
Description:
I've just discovered that DateConverter.toCalendar(String date) doesn't clear the milliseconds field from the calendar entries it returns. This means that if you turn the calendar object into a String, the return isn't stable, so your unit tests break
It looks to me that as the pdf format doesn't store to that level of detail, it should always be zero'd out, rather than being left to hold the milliseconds of the time you make the call.
This snippet is a failing unit test that shows the issue:
public void testDateConversion() throws Exception
{ Calendar c = DateConverter.toCalendar("D:20050526205258+01'00'"); assertEquals(2005, c.get(Calendar.YEAR)); assertEquals(05-1, c.get(Calendar.MONTH)); assertEquals(26, c.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH)); assertEquals(20, c.get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY)); assertEquals(52, c.get(Calendar.MINUTE)); assertEquals(58, c.get(Calendar.SECOND)); assertEquals(0, c.get(Calendar.MILLISECOND)); }
Adding "retval.set(Calendar.MILLISECOND, 0)" to the bottom of the method ought to fix it I'd think.
