Summary:
/Rotate 180 PDF is not displayed correctly in PDFReader app
Description:
To test PDFBOX-2021 I created a PDF with /Rotate 180. It does not display correctly in the PDFReader app (class PDFPagePanel). The purpose of this issue is to fix this and/or also use Johns new renderPageToGraphics() method per DRY.
I won't do it immediately so if anybody else wants to do it, just assign it to yourself.
