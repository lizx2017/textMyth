Summary:
FDFField.getValue() doesn't return the values in line with the Javadoc.
Description:
For the 2.0.x releases FDFField.getValue() doesn't neither return the documented PDTextStream return type nor String for values of type COSString or COSStream. This has somewhat be masked by another issue fixed in PDFBOX-3596.
As PDTextStream is no longer available we should return as String (which is inline with PDField) and adjust the javadoc accordingly.
