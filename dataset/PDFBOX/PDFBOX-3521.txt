Summary:
FontProvider not thread safe
Description:
I understand that PDFBox is not yet thread-safe, however, from reading this comment on a similar ticket, it seems like the fonts should be thread safe and is something that we want to fix. However, I am experiencing an intermittent NullPointerException when running multi-threaded unit tests that attempt to read several PDFs at once (see details here.
Inside FontMapperImpl.java the getProvider and setProvider methods are synchronised:
    public synchronized void setProvider(FontProvider fontProvider)
    {
        this.fontProvider = fontProvider;
        fontInfoByName = createFontInfoByName(fontProvider.getFontInfo());
    }

    /**
     * Returns the font service provider. Defaults to using FileSystemFontProvider.
     */
    public synchronized FontProvider getProvider()
    {
        if (fontProvider == null)
        {
            setProvider(DefaultFontProvider.INSTANCE);
        }
        return fontProvider;
    }
However, the calling code from the findFont() method is not synchronised:
        // make sure the font provider is initialized
        if (fontProvider == null)
        {
            getProvider();
        }

        // first try to match the PostScript name
        FontInfo info = getFont(format, postScriptName);
        if (info != null)
        {
            return info.getFont();
        }
As a result, if multiple threads attempt to access this at once, thread A may be in the setProvider method and have set fontProvider, but still processing the creation of fontInfoByName - so thread B could attempt to access before initialised.
