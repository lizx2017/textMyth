Summary:
Multiply blend mode not detected
Description:
The attached file should fail the PDF/A-1b check but doesn't. VeraPDF detects the incorrect blendmode at Root/Pages/Kids/[0]/Resources/ExtGState/R9/BM: "The following keys, if present in an ExtGState object, shall have the values shown: BM - Normal or Compatible".
The cause is that in ExtGStateValidationProcess.extractExtGStateDictionaries() there is a check that the name of the ExtGState matches "(GS|gs)([0-9])+". This has been since the beginning as an Apache project (PDFBOX-1056) and even since the first commit on github (https://github.com/gbm-bailleul/padaf) in 2010.
I could ask but I don't think that they would know why that decision was made over 8 years ago. My guess is that some code from elsewhere was reused.
