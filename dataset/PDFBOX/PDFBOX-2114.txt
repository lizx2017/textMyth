Summary:
ObjStm is being processed to late
Description:
I have a pdf that has the following
1 0 obj^M
<</Type/Catalog/Pages 5 0 R/Metadata 8 0 R/AcroForm<</Fields[]>>>>^M
and
22 0 obj^M
<</Type /ObjStm /N 2/First 10/Length 175/Filter /FlateDecode>>stream^M
Inside the 22 0 obj is the 5 0 which holds the pages. When 1 0obj is parsed then a place holder is set for the 5 0Obj with it's value set to null. When 22 0 is parsed it is not expanded so 5 0 is always null.
When I go to get all the pages
document.getDocumentCatalog().getAllPages() it returns 0 since
(COSDictionary)root.getDictionaryObject( COSName.PAGES ) is null.
Should ObjStm not get processed immediately so the objects tha are in there are filled?
I have a pdf as an example but it is confidential so I can send it someone off list
