Summary:
PDFBox: PDFReader invokes heap memory exception while loading big documents
Description:
I am trying to load load bigger document using PDFReader component of PDFBox with version 1.6.0, if I have not set any maximum heap memory then load method invokes heap memory exception. On setting java max heap to 800 resolve the issue.
But if I use the same PDFReader component of PDFBox with version 1.4.0 to load the same document with default java min and max heap memory it loads the pdf properly.
Is it possible to to investigate why memory is leaked with pdfbox component version higher than 1.4.
Thanks
