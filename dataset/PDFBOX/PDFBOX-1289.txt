Summary:
PDResources overrides any existing font when calling addFont
Description:
If you call addFont on a PDResource (for example, while calling setFont on a PDPageContentStream) without first having manually called getFonts on the resource, the "fonts" field will be set to a new hashmap. It will thus forego loading any existing font from the dictionary, and make those fonts disappear when saving the file again. The bug was probably introduced by the removal of the font mapping in the resources.
