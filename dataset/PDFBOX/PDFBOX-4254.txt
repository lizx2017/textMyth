Summary:
PDDocument.close() might ignore throwing an Exception
Description:
As discussed on the mailing list:
I had a look at IOUtils.closeAndLogException() and PDDocument.close() and if initialException is not null, then null is returned if a new exception is thrown, or if everything goes well. This means that at the end of PDDocument.close(), no exception would be thrown, right? Was this intended?
