Summary:
Create example to draw glyph sizes in rendered images
Description:
DrawPrintTextLocations is PrintTextLocations on steroids: after rendering an image, the bounds of the font sizes are drawn on it and the images are saved. This will allow to see whether a value shown by PrintTextLocations makes sense or not. The output as in PrintTextLocations will be kept. The classic PrintTextLocations will also be kept so that people don't write support questions.
