Summary:
Lost metadata in 2.0.8-SNAPSHOT
Description:
We noticed some missing metadata values in the recent large scale regression testing. I finally had a chance to look. It looks like a genuine regression.
The diff btwn 2.0.7 and 2.0.8-SNAPSHOT in metadata values is often -2. However, in some files, the problem is more pronounced.
In the attached file, when we call PDDocument.getDocumentInformation(), the returned PDDocumentInformation info is empty in 2.0.8-SNAPSHOT but not in 2.0.7.
