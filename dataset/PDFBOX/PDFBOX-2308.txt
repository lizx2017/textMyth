Summary:
setPageSeparator method in PDFTextStripper class has no effect
Description:
I tried to use the setPageSeparator method within the PDFTextStripper class but it had no effect.
After a check within the sources at a glance I discovered that the writePageSeparator method that uses the pageSeparator attribute is never called or used anywhere.
Thus, to work normally, It seems to my point of view that a call to the writePageSeparator should be added for example at the beginning of the writePage() method. Could someone of the core team check it to say me if i'am right ?
