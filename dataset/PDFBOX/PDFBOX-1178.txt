Summary:
Type3Validation error when firstChar and lastChar badly defined in font description dictionary
Description:
I have got a problem with a font in a PDF/A where LastChar entry seems badly defined (255). I will add the file if possible. The file is valid with commercial validators.
File cannot be validated due to NullPointerException because the case "character stream not existing and character width not defined" is not handle. I join a patch that accept that character are not defined.
With this patch, validation works. I put "TODO" where new case have to be handled.
