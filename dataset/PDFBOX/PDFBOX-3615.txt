Summary:
Multiply transparency not anti-aliased
Description:
Not sure if this is related to other transparency issues like PDFBOX-3000, but I noticed that certain elements were really jagged in my PDFs.
It looks like items with multiply transparency applied aren't anti-aliased.
I've attached an example PDF and resulting PNG from pdfbox-app-2.0.3.jar
