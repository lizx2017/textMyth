Summary:
ClassCastException at PDFParser:667
Description:
from "skenny" in the user mailing list:
I'm using PDFMergerUtility to merge a number of PDF input streams and write
them to an HTTP response output stream. One of the PDFs is failing at line
667 in PDFParser:
    final COSName objectType = (COSName)strmObj.getItem( COSName.TYPE );
The result of getItem(COSName.TYPE) is a COSString (value "Metadata") and
not a COSName.
