Summary:
Form field not rendered after being processed by pdfbox-1.1.0, wrong position of same field in pdfbox-1.5.0
Description:
I have a pdf form that was created with Adobe Acrobat 7.0 Professional. I feed the pdf into pdfbox and write it out again with
document= PDDocument.load(pdf);
document.save(pdf.getCanonicalPath());
I realized that a recently added form field within the pdf is not visible when I use pdfbox-1.1.0. When I use the current pdfbox-1.5.0, the field is visible, but has an incorrect position. The three pdf attachments illustrate the behavior.
Interestingly, pdfbox handles the pdf correctly, once I save the original pdf under a new file name. The "save as..." function in Acrobat Professional seems to perform some kind of compacting / clean-up within the pdf, which is also reflected by a smaller file size.
Thanks
