First of all a few minor problems
apostrophes replaced by question marks. A global
replace will of course make nonsense of any true
question marks in the document
the 'fi' in 'glorified' at the end of the main
article also replaced by '?', as also in at least 2
other instances
'J' before the author's name is presumably a
replacement for the non-text character, and should
probably be replaced by a blank line instead
