Summary:
PDSimpleFont.determineEncoding will never parse embedded CMAPs
Description:
The enconding of a PDSimpleFont is determined in determineEncoding. It contains a series of ifs. Most notably at the end there is a:
if (encoding instanceof COSDictionary)
{ ... }
else if (encoding instanceof COSStream) { ... }
This is wrong because COSStream is a subclass of COSDictionary, so the program will never get into the COSStream-specific block, which is responsible for the parsing of embedded CMAPs. The solution would be to reverse the order of those ifs.
