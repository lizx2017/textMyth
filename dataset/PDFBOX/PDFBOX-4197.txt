Summary:
PDStructureElement.getAttributes() ignores reference objects
Description:
Attribute dictionaries attached to a structure element may be either direct or references.  getAttributes() handles the direct case but ignores object references without error messages.  This can also lead to invalid revision numbers attached to the attribute dictionaries it does handle properly.
  The fix would be to add another branch to the iteration loop in PDStructureElement.getAttributes(), to handle object references.
