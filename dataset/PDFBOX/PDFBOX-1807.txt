Summary:
TextToPDF strips leading spaces from input file
Description:
When using the TextToPDF utility on a text file that has spaces in the front for formatting purposes, the leading spaces on the line are being stripped causing the report to no longer looks like it did in the PDF.
Was this the intended result? Is there a way to turn off the stripping of the spaces? If not, can it be added?
