Summary:
NullPointerException PDFFont#getEncodingFromFont with a PDF book because Type1Encoding is null
Description:
A NullPointerException was thrown while extracting text from a PDF ebook. The exception was thrown in
PDFFont#getEncodingFromFont line:
[snip]
encoding.addCharacterEncoding(index, name.replace("/", ""));
[snip]
encoding was null. The line that was scanned was "/Encoding 256 array 0 1 255
{1 index exch /.notdef put}
for". The array check however only checks for line.endsWith("array"). The NPE was fixed when using line.contains("array") instead.
I have added a patch. The PDF is a PDF book with copyright so it cannot be attached as an example. The meta data of the document was:
Acrobat Distiller 7.0 (Windows)
