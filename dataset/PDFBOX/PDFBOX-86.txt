hi folks,
just for info:
might be the same problem as described in bug 1118054
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1118054&group_id=78314&atid=552832
the form field is not displayed as it should be, happens
with different fonts or attributes (my problem), happens
with rotated fields in a usual page (barcode problem of
_daniel) and happens with usual fields on a rotated page. It
simply seems to be a problem that form fields are displayed
wrong if some parameter is not set to default.
i'd like to know if the form field changes it's way of being
displayed when setting the cursor into the field. this
usually happens with fields described in the other bug.
see ya
