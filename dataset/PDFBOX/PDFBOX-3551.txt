Summary:
CLI Decrypt broken, only allows 1 argument
Description:
This is about the Decrypt.java CLI wrapper fails when using certificates.
Plain and simple. The following file just simply doesn't allow for more than one CLI argument: tools/src/main/java/org/apache/pdfbox/tools/Decrypt.java
WHEN, I supply the argument keyStore and password, the usage documentation is thrown.
WHEN, I hack the Decrypt.java CLI wrapper in tools, and allow the password AND keyStore arguments to BOTH be present, the decrypt works.
The command I am trying to run:
java -jar pdfbox-app-2.0.3.jar Decrypt -password password -keyStore keystore.p12 encrypted.pdf decrypted.pdf
PDFBox CLI docs for decrypt WHERE clearly password AND keyStore need to be used together: http://pdfbox.apache.org/2.0/commandline.html#decrypt
IN CLOSING, instead of fighting my case that the CLI Decrypt method is NOT working, I am choosing to keep it simple by stating fact that ONLY ONE argument is allowed OTHERWISE the usage docs are thrown.
Thank you kindly. I have been able to rebuild the jar files with my own fix by using Maven to re-jar. I absolutely sure I am generating proper certs and p12 keyStore files and again I am successfully encrypting/decrypting with my update pdfbox.jar file
