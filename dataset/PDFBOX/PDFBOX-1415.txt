Summary:
I have a 6-page PDF, but opening it with PdfBox shows only 5
Description:
I have a PDF document, with 6 pages. however, when i open it using PDFBox, and get num of pages, i see only 5.
i guess that the 6th page is different somehow - i have no idea how - but it makes PdfBox not to "see" it.
since the doc is sensitive, I will try to reproduce the similar problem with another doc and the upload it.
