Summary:
Potential NPE in PDMarkedContent#getMCID()
Description:
I do not have a test case, but this method in PDMarkedContent is obviously wrong:
    public int getMCID()
    {
        return this.getProperties() == null ? null :
            this.getProperties().getInt(COSName.MCID);
    }
if getProperties() is null, the method tries to convert null Integer value to an int. I believe the intention was rather:
...
        return this.getProperties() == null ? 0 :
...
