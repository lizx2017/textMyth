Summary:
PDFImageWriter extracts black images from arabic PDFs
Description:
When I tried to extract a JPEG image from arabic PDF, i've got a corrupted file with black area which overlays all arabic text on each page.
In console i've got only this debug message and no other exceptions and so on:
DEBUG (PDPixelMap.java:241) - ColorModel: IndexColorModel: #pixelBits = 1 numComponents = 4 color space = java.awt.color.ICC_ColorSpace@2eeb3c84 transparency = 2 transIndex = 1 has alpha = true isAlphaPre = false
This is not only one pdf file. I have about 400-500 files which produces the same thing.
Code:
PDFImageWriter writer = new PDFImageWriter();
PDDocument document = PDDocument.load(sourceFile);
writer.writeImage(document, "jpg", "", 1, 1, filename);
