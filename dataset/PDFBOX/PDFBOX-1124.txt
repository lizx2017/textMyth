Description:
i am using the pdfbox libraries in C# with Framework 3.5.
my code is :-
PDDocument doc = PDDocument.load("pdf file path");
PDFTextStripper stripper = new PDFTextStripper();
Result = stripper.getText(doc);
this code is running and working fine. but in case of few pdf(specially when it has images)
