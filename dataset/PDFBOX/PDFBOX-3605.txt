Summary:
Infinite Read Loop in BufferedRandomAccesssFile
Description:
When reading an input file using the BufferedRandomAccesssFile an infinite loop will occur once the buffer is drained and the value leftover becomes 0, since the read method will continue to return 0 as the -1 result from fillBuffer() is never propagated upstream and any code that is executing in a loop using -1 as an indicator that the file has been fully read will never exit.
An example of where this occurs can be found here:
