Summary:
wasted work in PublicKeySecurityHandler.prepareForDecryption()
Description:
The problem appears in version 1.7.1 and in revision 1414743. I
attached a one-line patch that fixes it. This problem and the
attached patch are similar the previously fixed PDFBOX-1447 and its
patch.
In method "PublicKeySecurityHandler.prepareForDecryption", the loop
over "recipCertificatesIt" should break immediately after
"foundRecipient" is set to "true" and "envelopedData" is set to
"ri.getContent(...)". All the iterations after "foundRecipient" is
set to "true" do not perform any useful work because the "if"
statement depends on "!foundRecipient".
