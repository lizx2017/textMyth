Summary:
image mask outline with shading pattern is invisible
Description:
This is also somewhat of a regression: two weeks ago, the attached file had the image rendered in b/w, now it is invisible. I was able to get the image in another (wrong) color by changing one line in BeginInlineImage.java, the one with TODO to
awtImage = image.getStencilImage(colorSpace.toPaint(color, image.getHeight())); // <--- TODO: pass page height?
