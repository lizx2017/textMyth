Summary:
Keywords are enclosed in quotes.
Description:
I add keywords (and other properties) via the PDDocumentInformation:
pddi.setKeywords("Test4711");
The resulting PDF shows those keywords but enclosed in quotes:
"Test4711"
instead of just the string:
Test4711
Other strings I set with PDDocumentInformation are shown correctly (without quotes). I debugged my code to ensure that the string object passed to setKeywords() is correct (i.e. without any additional quotes).
