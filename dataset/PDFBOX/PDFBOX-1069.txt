Summary:
Ubuntu throws exceptions when fonts missing
Description:
On a plain vanilla Ubuntu 10.10 install, running
run-all failed to render any text, and threw lots of exceptions:
org.apache.pdfbox.pdmodel.font.PDTrueTypeFont.getawtFont(PDTrueTypeFont.java:425)
...however, installing the package "ttf-mscorefonts-installer"
made those exceptions go away.
(ubuntu1010_output.txt shows the exceptions; ubuntu1010_try2_output.txt is a run after the extra fonts are installed)
Might be able to fix this one by setting UNKNOWN_FONT in
Resources/PDFBox_External_Fonts.properties, but it would seem like
it should choose some reasonable default if it isn't set...
shouldn't it?
