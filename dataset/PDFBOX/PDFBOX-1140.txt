Summary:
TTFDataStream.read32Fixed() discards fractions
Description:
TTFDataStream.read32Fixed() tries to calculate its fractional part by dividing an unsigned short with 65536. But because this method uses an integer division, the fractional value will always be 0. I've attached a simple patch that fixes this.
