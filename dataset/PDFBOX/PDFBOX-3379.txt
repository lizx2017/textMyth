Summary:
PDType0Font Subsetting Monospace DejaVuSansMono
Description:
Hi,
we came across the problem that the monospace font dejaVuSansMono has problems with spaces in strings if they are rendered in a pdf and a PDFType0Font is used for subsetting. If a space is placed within the strings the letters from every word are placed overlapping each other, see attached files. Seems that the advancedWidth array int the HorizontalMetricsTable contains a wrong, very low value as 3rd entry after subsetting the font. We compared it with a second monospace font, and it worked there. The difference between the two fonts is that the dejaVu Mono only contains 4 advanceWidth entries and the second one contains an entry for every glyph. This second font was VeraMono.ttf . The fonts are loaded via PDType0Font.load(doc, fontfile).
