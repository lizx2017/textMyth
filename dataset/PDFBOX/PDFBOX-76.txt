Hi Ben,

Thanks!

A parser for Type1C CFF fonts needs to be written. Adobe
technical spec 5176 CFF talks about the file format. It is a
binary format that looks pretty straighforward, should be
pretty fun to write a parser for it.
This is not a high priority right now, but if someone is willing
to write the parser I will integrate it. If you would like to write
a parser please let me know and we can discuss, it needs to
be somewhat robust as the data structures it creates should
support modifying data so the font can be written back to a
stream, which will support embedding fonts back into the pdf
document.
If this parser is written, I may start a separate project that just
deals with font files in java, PDFBox currently has parsers for
TTF/PFB and soon CFF I see more advanced font
requirements in the pipeline, this type of functionality is really
outside the scope of PDFBox but I don't believe anything else
exists. I am sure if I start a font library project there are other
java libraries that could make use of it as well
