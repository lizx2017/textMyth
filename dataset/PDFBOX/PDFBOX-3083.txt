Description:
Hi,
I was trying to convert my pdf file to image (jpg or png) but only the grey text (see my attached pdf) were successfully converted to an image file but the blue text cannot.
I've try to extract this pdf with several PdfBox versions : 2.0, 1.8.10, and 1.6 but it doesn't work.
However, with 1.6, the generated image contains both grey and blue text but in an incorrect layout/alignment.
Can you please verify this issue?
Please also let me know if you have any quick fix for this issue.
