Summary:
Existing AcroForm default resources is overwritten by signing code
Description:
assignAcroFormDefaultResource overwrites the existing /DR entry. I am applying a slightly modified version of the patch from Marco Monacelli that was attached in PDFBOX-3738. It inserts instead of overwrites when the entry exists.
