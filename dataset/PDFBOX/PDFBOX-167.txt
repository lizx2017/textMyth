PDFBox appears to have a problem properly highlighting
words from the following PDF. I am using a very simple
servlet to do this, and it works fine for most PDFs.
With this one, however, it highlights the wrong words.
Unfortunately I am not smart enough to figure out what
is going on myself, so could anybody help me with this?

That document is in a password-protected area, so it can't be read by anyone else! I have a similar problem with this doc:
http://www.usc.edu/schools/business/FBE/seminars/papers/AE_4-28-06_FISMAN-parking.pdf
... but I think I've figured this one out. The second page of this document is entirely blank, and checking by hand I can see that the highlights after p1 are all in positions that would be correct if they were one page further on; it appears that the page count isn't being incremented for the blank page. Tracing this back in the code I see this:
PDStream contentStream = nextPage.getContents();
if( contentStream != null )
{ COSStream contents = contentStream.getStream(); processPage( nextPage, contents ); }
(PDFTextStripper.java line 255). That's skipping the blank page and giving me the wrong page no, I think - and I guess that the problem can be resolved by moving currentPageNo++ from inside processPage to just above that test.
