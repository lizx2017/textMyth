Summary:
fontbox not decoding font correctly for all characters
Description:
Attached is a particular PDF with a font encoding that PDFBox does not always understand. Some letters are correct, but most are not. It appears to have something to do with a particular font, which I was hoping would degrade gracefully. I don't know enough about the issue to tell if is a problem with embedded fonts.
