Hi all.
When I try to set the value of a combo box to " ", it
gives the following error:
Exception in thread "main"
java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: -2
at java.util.ArrayList.set(Unknown Source)
at
org.pdfbox.pdmodel.interactive.form.PDAppearance.setAppearanceValue(PDAppearance.java:323)

org.pdfbox.pdmodel.interactive.form.PDVariableText.setValue(PDVariableText.java:145)

org.pdfbox.pdmodel.interactive.form.PDChoiceField.setValue(PDChoiceField.java:91)
at pdfForms.PDFForms.setvalorCampo(PDFForms.java:235)
at pdfForms.SetValores.main(SetValores.java:
I found out the following. I think it may help you to
understand the problem.
When the default value, set by Acrobat Professional
7.0, is set to " ", the error occurs; when is set to
another value, lets say "A", the value " " is setted
correctly. If i run the program again, trying to set
the value " ", the error does not ocurr.
Thanks,
Luis Catalino
