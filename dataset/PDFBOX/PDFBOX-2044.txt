Summary:
TrueType glyphs not displayed in rendering
Description:
In the file of PDFBOX-2041 the text isn't displayed in the 2.0 version. It works in the 1.8 version which uses awt.
The cause is related to the truetype 'loca' table:
https://developer.apple.com/fonts/TTRefMan/RM06/Chap6loca.html
In the table of that file, the endOfGlyphs variable, which is the last offset value ("extra" in the spec), is 0. Therefore, GlyphTable.initData() doesn't read any glyphs because it believes that the end has already been reached, because the first offset is (of course) 0 and is identical to the endOfGlyphs variable.
I will fix this by disregarding endOfGlyphs == offset if endOfGlyphs is 0, and not asking for offset equality to skip glyphs, instead I require that the next offset is bigger.
