Summary:
wasted work in PDFMarkedContentExtractor.processTextPosition()
Description:
The problem appears in version 1.7.1 and in revision 1409864. I
attached a one-line patch that fixes it.
In method "PDFMarkedContentExtractor.processTextPosition", the loop
over "sameTextCharacters" should break immediately after
"suppressCharacter" is set to "true". All the iterations after
"suppressCharacter" is set to "true" do not perform any useful work,
at best they just set "suppressCharacter" again to "true".
Method "processTextPosition" in class "PDFTextStripper" has a similar
loop, and this loop breaks immediately after "suppressCharacter" is
set to "true", just like in the proposed patch.
