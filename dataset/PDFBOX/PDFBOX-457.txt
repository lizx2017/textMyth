Summary:
Invalid code encountered while decoding CCITT
Description:
I tried to convert the following document to image, but I got the attached result.
It parsed just the text. I also tried different formats like JPG. I ran it using the PDFToImage class passing the document path as parameter.
I've read that sometimes the document is not created respecting the PDF standard. But, is there a possibility to ignore it?! In fact, it's very important to me, so, could I use PDF Box despite of those "errors"?
Thank you
Marcelo
