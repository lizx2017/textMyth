Summary:
Error while create a PDCcitt object to embed in PDF
Description:
I've got this error while embeding a TIFF file, using this code:
image = new PDCcitt(doc, new RandomAccessFile(new File(filename), "r"));
And got the following exception:
java.io.IOException: First image in tiff is not CCITT T4 or T6 compressed
at org.apache.pdfbox.pdmodel.graphics.xobject.PDCcitt.extractFromTiff(PDCcitt.java:353)
at org.apache.pdfbox.pdmodel.graphics.xobject.PDCcitt.<init>(PDCcitt.java:86)
Is this CCITT T4/T6 compression mandatory to get this image embed?
