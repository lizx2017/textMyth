Summary:
PDF signature invalid after second interactive field signed
Description:
Hi guys,
I stumped on the problem with PDFBox and interactive field signing. I have PDF generated with OpenText StreamServe with two interactive fields for signing. See example 1 (streamserve_test_sig0.pdf) in attachement.
When I use Adobe Reader I can sign both of the visual fields just fine but when I use PDFBox to sign one of this field the following signature is marked as invalid. Doesn't matter if I use PDFbox or sign it manually with Adobe Reader See example 3: 
 streamserve_test_sig3.pdf (signed by PDFBox) - valid
 streamserve_test_sig3.signed.pdf (signed 2nd by Adobe Reader) - invalid
  Also last example - when it´s signed first by Adobe Reader and then with PDFBox the signature seems valid but it says the document was "certified". See example 2 (streamserve_test_sig2.pdf)
  What could be wrong? When is signed whole document with PDFBox it works just fine.
Thanks for response,
Martin
