Summary:
Text extraction gets zero font height for type3 fonts
Description:
Fred Andrews posted this to the user list and I can confirm that text extraction gets nothing:
I am using PDFTextStripper on some PDF statements from Bank of America, and everything is coming through as zero height. I traced it down to getFontHeight in org.apache.pdfbox.pdmodel.font.PDSimpleFont, which is indeed getting zero. The font is a type 3 font and I'm not sure how it should work, but getFontHeight is calling getAFM() and that is returning a null because its not a type 1 font. Then in the next section in getFontHeight there are no font descriptors, and the zero just flows through all the way through getFontHeight.
I searched for anything I could key on to calculate the font height but couldn't find it. The font size is claimed to be 20 by getFontSize(), although it appears to be more like 8. I did trace to where it got a font size command of twenty, but somehow I'm assuming that would need to be scaled, and I can't see where that might come from.
The font width on the other hand looks accurate, and I would think something similar to that would be needed, but would really appreciate some guidance on how it should work. If I have clue on how it should work I can see what I can do to implement it.
This file displays fine in Acrobat and edits fine in Nitro, so it can't be that invalid.
