Summary:
PDF created by Bullzip PDF Printer / www.bullzip.com / Freeware Edition shows weird characters
Description:
Opening the PDF via PDFReader 1.6 + 1.7 SNAPSHOT results in an unreadable page. All other pdf viewers I tried have correctly displayed the file.
The only related log message shown was
25.08.2011 11:59:41 org.apache.pdfbox.util.PDFStreamEngine processOperator
INFO: unsupported/disabled operation: EI
which is probably unrelated. My guess its the font they used (see screenshot) however if the font is unknown or problematic, shouldn't pdfreader use a default font or something? Maybe I am wrong anyway
