Summary:
Missing entries in glyphlist
Description:
Due to some license restrictions we had to move the glyphlist from svn to an external location. While doing that the mapping was replaced with an original copy from adobe. See PDFBOX-494 for further details.
After the replacement some glyph-mappings are missing as mentioned by Aaron Kaplan in [1]. We have to put them somehow back to resolve an issue with the textectracting unit test.
IMHO there are two solutions possible:
1) Replace the glyphlist with an update, if available
2) add the missing mappings "by hand" using an additional list
