Summary:
Japanese text not extracted
Description:
ExtractText does not return the text content of this PDF. There are just a few real characters when running 1.8.8, and none with today's 2.0.0 snapshot.
I also attach the output from pdftotext 0.26.5 (from poppler-utils), which seems to get it mostly right.
