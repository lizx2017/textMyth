Summary:
FontBox's TTFDataStream doesn't set timezone in readInternationalDate
Description:
TTFDataStream doesn't set the timezone for the calendar. GregorianCalendar defaults to the system's timezone. This means that people in different timezones will get slightly different dates. (TIKA-1325).
One TTF Spec (https://developer.apple.com/fonts/TTRefMan/RM06/Chap6.html) doesn't specify the timezone, but my guess would be UTC...except that it is Apple, so maybe it's Cupertino.
