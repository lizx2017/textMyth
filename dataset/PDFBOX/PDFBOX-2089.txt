Summary:
Negative width of character
Description:
This PDF contains text matrix:
-10.5679 0 0 -11.4 459.0349 19.4155 Tm
that causes IMHO wrong calculation of character width (and height).
Width and height calculated in PDFStreamEngine are negative numbers, because textMatrix.getXScale() gives negative value.
I think it should be fixed in Matrix.getXScale() and Matrix.getYScale(). Returning value should be fixed by Math.abs()
