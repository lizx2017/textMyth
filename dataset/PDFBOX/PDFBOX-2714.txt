Summary:
Type1Fonts working on one computer, not another
Description:
Asked on SO, Tilman suggests I open a JIRA: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29111310/pdfbox-2-0-0-type1fonts-working-on-one-computer-not-another
I am trying to work out why I'm getting a bunch of `java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: No glyph for U+0057 in font Helvetica-Bold` errors on a Windows 2012 Server dev environment, but not on my local Windows 7 environment.
I built the trunk from scratch, with: `mvn -DskipTests=true install`
on my machine (Win 7), collected the jars and made a very rudimentary test package, by dumping all the jars into a subfolder libs/ and copying the `org/apache/pdfbox/examples `class files to the same directory, to see if the HelloWorld program works.
The [HelloWorld program][1] creates a file, called test.pdf with the message "WHY" as requested, but when I run it on a new machine, I get the following:
C:\EAP-6.3.0\PDFBOXTESTING>java -cp ".;libs/*" org.apache.pdfbox.examples.pdmodel.HelloWorld test.pdf WHY
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: No glyph for U+0057 in font Helvetica-Bold
at org.apache.pdfbox.pdmodel.font.PDType1Font.encode(PDType1Font.java:303)
at org.apache.pdfbox.pdmodel.font.PDFont.encode(PDFont.java:268)
at org.apache.pdfbox.pdmodel.PDPageContentStream.showText(PDPageContentStream.java:316)
at org.apache.pdfbox.examples.pdmodel.HelloWorld.main(HelloWorld.java:59)
I installed Adobe Reader XI on that computer, in case it needed the fonts from Adobe, installed on the system, or who knows.
It's not finding `U+0057`, which is a W, and in my testing, it wasn't finding a bunch of stuff. It basically didn't find anything. so something is fundamentally wrong, maybe the operating system has provided a bad font?
