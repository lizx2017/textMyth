Summary:
Printing has bigger margins than expected
Description:
Printing the attached file from PDFReader brings larger margins than expected, and larger than with Adobe Reader. Doing the same with 1.8 has the expected margins (but bad fonts).
From Александр Свиридов / Alex Sviridov in the mailing list:
I printed this pdf file with Adobe Reader in mode 100%. And as expected left and right margins are about 2cm. In comparison when I print using pdfbox left margin is 4.5cm, right about 3.5cm.
The code I use :
PrinterJob job = PrinterJob.getPrinterJob();
Paper paper=new Paper();
paper.setSize(72d*8.267d, 72d*11.692);
PDFPrinter pDFPrinter=new PDFPrinter(document,Scaling.SCALE_TO_FIT, Orientation.PORTRAIT,paper);
pDFPrinter.silentPrint(job);
