Summary:
Memory leak with org.apache.pdfbox.pdmodel.font.PDFont#cmapObjects
Description:
We use Tika to extract text from a large number (10,000+) of PDFs in a long running JVM, after doing this for a while we started running short of heap space. A heap dump shows that about 717MB of heap is retained through org.apache.pdfbox.pdmodel.font.PDFont#cmapObjects and the hashmap has 18001 entries.
PDFBOX-1009 looked to partially address this but it appears the symptons are still present. As a workaround I'm going to manually call PDFont.clearResources() after indexing each document to prevent this happening, but it would be better if I didn't have to.
