Summary:
Columns in text not extracted separately
Description:
The paper that is attached to PDFBOX-80 has two columns of text, but the extracted text is not separated by column. Instead it combines the text in each column on each line.
PDFTextStripper has a notion of columns and "articles / beads", but they are not being used with this file.
