The addSignature() method always set the visual signature on the last page of the PDF
Description:
The addSignature() method always set the visual signature on the last page of the PDF.
This is certainly due to the following lines in PDDocument class :
PDDocument.java
...
int startIndex = Math.max(Math.min(options.getPage(), 0), pageCount - 1);
PDPage page = catalog.getPages().get(startIndex);
...
I think Math.min and Math.max have been inverted.
