Following document taken from Guttenberg project
http://www.gutenberg.org/ does not separate words
with spaces. I even debugged PdfBox and
PDFStreamEngine.showString() never receives the space
(32) character. Is possible that space is not in the
document (it looks that way). If so is there a way to
force insert the spaces as word separators (not sure
if this should be part of PDFStreamEngine.showString
() or it is user's responsibility in this case)?
File is to big to attach, here is the link:
