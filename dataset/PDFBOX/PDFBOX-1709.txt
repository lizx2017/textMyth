Summary:
processEncodedText gives wrong coordinates
Description:
PDFStreamEngine#processEncodedText gives x-coord short by width of previous text, for next text at same y-coord.
â€”
Use this PostScript to create PDFs that demonstrate x-coordinate issue with processEncodedText().

% CASES
% Uncomment any one of the following, make a PDF (with ghostscript ps2pdf, or acrobat distiller),
% then process the PDF with java implementation of PDFBox PDFTextStripper.
% listing text and x,y positions obtained by overriding the processEncodedText() method.
% For example, the x-coord. of a text item may be printed in that method with
% System.out.format("%.2f\n", this.getTextMatrix().getXPosition());
% % 0. Works to convince processEncodedText that string 'Hello world.' was at 100,72. This is good.
%
% ( world.) show
% % 1. Does not trick processEncodedText into thinking 'Hello' followed by ' ' + 'world.'
% % Instead,
% % x-coord. of 'world.' reported as being actual position minus width of 'Hello', plus width of ' '
% % which is x=105.56 in this case.

% % 2. Positioning 'world.' within about 500 points from 'Hello', at same vertical position causes
% % processEncodedText to give

% % which is x=200 in this case.
