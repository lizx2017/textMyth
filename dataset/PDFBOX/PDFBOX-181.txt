So far, I changed document information with PDFBox (2)
of our PDF files after generating them with FOP (1).
Now I would like to optimize the PDF files and
therefore inserted a new step inbetween those steps
(1) and (2) by first optimizing the generated PDF to
enable the "fast web view" feature of the PDF (display
1st page while loading the rest). And then I continue
with setting the document properties with PDFBox. But
PDFBox disables this fast web view feature again.
(I tried optimizing the PDF after the PDFBox DocInfo
step, but this doesn't work because the PDFs are also
encrypted in the PDFBox step by setting the encryption
properties, too.)
