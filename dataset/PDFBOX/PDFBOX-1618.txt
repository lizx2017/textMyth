Summary:
Split PDF file to single page files, some files are inflated in size
Description:
A PDF file is split into single pages for inclusion within another document (pdfbox.utils.Splitter within our code but same phenomenon observed when splitting using command line PDFSplit tool). Som of the pages are almost as large as the original file which causes performance problems for our customers.
Again, I have a sample pdf to attach.
