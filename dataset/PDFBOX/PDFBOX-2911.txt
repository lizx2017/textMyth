Summary:
Merge does not close input streams
Description:
As explained in the linked SO post: merge closes the source documents, but not the source streams.
One can call addSource() with a File object and then there would be no way for the caller to close the inputstream, so that would be a bug for sure. Not yet sure what to do when called with streams.
