Summary:
No glyph for U+1F609 in font
Description:
I am trying to include unicode supplementary characters (emojis in this case) in a PDF document with an embedded font.
Initially I was using fonts that really didn't have the glyphs so the error message was correct. Now I have tried the Symbola font and the NotoEmoji-Regular font and I still get the error. For instance:
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: No glyph for U+1F609 in font Symbola
at org.apache.pdfbox.pdmodel.font.PDCIDFontType2.encode(PDCIDFontType2.java:404)
at org.apache.pdfbox.pdmodel.font.PDType0Font.encode(PDType0Font.java:342)
at org.apache.pdfbox.pdmodel.font.PDFont.encode(PDFont.java:323)
at org.apache.pdfbox.pdmodel.font.PDFont.getStringWidth(PDFont.java:352)
I have verified my font files have the glyph using FontForge.
Is there another step I need to take to use supplementary characters?
