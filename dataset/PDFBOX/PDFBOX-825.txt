Summary:
Wrong opacity for images with indexed color space
Description:
In class PDPixelMap used to decode images the handling of opacity for images with color space PDIndexed is wrong.
Test PDF: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajh.21765/pdf
(or another PDF with image and color space /Indexed)
Picture Im2 at page 4 of the test PDF is empty (all pixels white).
The reason:
In PDPixelMap at line 205 (rev. 988513) an opacity variable is set depending on first value of Decode parameter.
This parameter often is not specified (null) and default value is [0, 2^n-1]. Thus the code:
boolean isOpaque = (decode != null && decode.getInt(0) == 1) ? true : false;
sets isOpaque to false, resulting in all white pixel.
Exchanging 'true' and 'false' would help but I even can't imagine why a first value of '1' should
be interpreted as an opacity parameter? Am I missing something (some kind of workaround)?
If there are no good reasons for keeping the opaque parameter I would propose removing it and setting alpha to 0xff in every case.
