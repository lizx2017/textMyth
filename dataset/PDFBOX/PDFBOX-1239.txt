Summary:
Using PDFToImage creates blank images on pages.
Description:
I have been using PDFToImage to create images from the PDF documents and everything has been working great until I ran into this file.
It will create the images of each page but not display the image correctly. Either it will show the image as white or black. I attached the pdf and some of the images it created. Below I have used this command and some of the output. Any ideas? Is it because it is an embedded image relating to PDFBOX-1095
