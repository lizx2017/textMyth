Summary:
EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION with PDF file and image conversion
Description:
Hello,
I do receive an unhandled exception during image conversion of the attached pdf file.
For image conversion i've used the PDFToImage.java example.
The pdf file has been created with Foxit PDF-Printer.
Every generated pdf file will crash the whole JRE, so my whole application crashes with the following trace.
The affected pdf file has been attached.
The error report file has been attached.
Hopefully this error can be handled that the JRE won't crash anymore.
Thanks
