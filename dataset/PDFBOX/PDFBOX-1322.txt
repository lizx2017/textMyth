Summary:
gif with less than 256 colors prints wrong colors
Description:
Using JasperReports, generate report with embedded jpg image. To make the resulting pdf smaller, I converted the image to a gif and tried to use as few colors as possible. The image is very simple and jpg wasn't the correct format to begin with, since it just has three colors. I used fsview to reduce the number of colors from 256 to 4. It is correct when printed by adobe, but when the java program, using pdfbox, prints it, the white background is prints as grey and the solid blue section seems less saturated so it's a light blue.
