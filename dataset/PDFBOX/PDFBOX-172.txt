The attached file is extracted as text using
PDFTextConverter.writeText(PDDocument, StringWriter) .
The output text is problematic:
1. Words are fused together: ASTROBIOLOGYVolume,
PaperThe, ABSTRACTThe, etc.
2. Words are mis-spelled: "comunity"
3. The bottom part of the ABSTRACT (at the beginning
of the 2nd page of the PDF) is found AFTER the rest
of the content of the 2nd page.
4. The two columns of text from the 3rd page of the
PDF are found in reversed order in the XML.
