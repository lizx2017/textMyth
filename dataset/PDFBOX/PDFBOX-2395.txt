Summary:
Signing PDF document changes documentID
Description:
When I invoke the method #setDocumentId(...) on PDDocument the document id changes completely.
Following the standard:
Every PDF document should have an ID array in the file trailer. From the PDF 1.7 Reference, "TABLE 3.13 Entries in the file trailer dictionary":
"ID array (Optional, but strongly recommended; PDF 1.1) An array of two byte-strings constituting a file identifier (see Section 10.3, “File Identifiers”) for the file. ..."
In section "10.3 File Identifiers" it says:
"File identifiers are defined by the optional ID entry in a PDF file’s trailer dictionary (see Section 3.4.4, “File Trailer”; see also implementation note 162 in Appendix H). The value of this entry is an array of two byte strings. The first byte string is a permanent identifier based on the contents of the file at the time it was originally created and does not change when the file is incrementally updated. The second byte string is a changing identifier based on the file’s contents at the time it was last updated."
See original issue: https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/asset/sd-dss/issue/signing-pdf-document-sd-dss-changes-id-string
So if I understand well only the second element must change. Please could you provide me with your understanding of the problem.
Thanks / Bob
