Summary:
Image with mask missing in rendering
Description:
The png logo shows up in other pdf readers but not in pdf.js
And we have the same problem. And GS too.
The file is broken.
I get the "bad" effect in Acrobat Reader if I insert "/ImageMask true" in the mask. If I set it to false then the rendering is good. This leads me to the conclusion that this part of the spec is to be taken literally: "However, if the image dictionary's ImageMask entry is true, the sample data shall be interpreted as a stencil mask for applying the graphics state's nonstroking colour parameters (see 8.9.6.2, "Stencil Masking")." i.e. that if /ImageMask isn't there or is false, the mask is to be ignored.
This can be confirmed by a trick: at the beginning of the content stream, change "1 1 1 rg" (white) to "1 0 1 rg" (pink). Display with Adobe Reader, the white square is there. If masking had been working, only the seal would be seen without a white square.
If your eyes are good, you can see the dirt below the seal, which can also be seen in the unedited PDF. If the masking had been working, the dirt wouldn't be seen.
So for PDFBox, I'll simply change to apply the mask only if /ImageMask true.
