Summary:
PageDrawer does not take the full CropBox into account
Description:
A client sent me a PDF which was basically a double-sided page of which only the right side was shown by the CropBox. But PDFBox displayed the left side in the PDFReader. I've created a minimal test case with FOP and a Hex Editor showing the problem. It seems as if the PageDrawer doesn't take the full CropBox information into account when painting the page.
