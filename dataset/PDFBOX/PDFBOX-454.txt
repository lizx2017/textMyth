Summary:
IOException upon opening a PDF
Description:
Tim reports:
"I am working with PDFBox-0.7.3-dev and receive the following error when
opening a PDF file:
Exception in thread "main" java.io.IOException: Error: Expected an integer
type, actual='/Subtype/Image'
at org.pdfbox.pdfparser.BaseParser.readInt(BaseParser.java:1335)
at org.pdfbox.pdfparser.PDFParser.parseObject(PDFParser.java:415)
at org.pdfbox.pdfparser.PDFParser.parse(PDFParser.java:176)
at org.pdfbox.pdmodel.PDDocument.load(PDDocument.java:578)
at org.pdfbox.pdmodel.PDDocument.load(PDDocument.java:549)
at cmecf.pdf.xxx.ProcessPDF(xxx.java:257)
at cmecf.pdf.xxx.main(xxx.java:78)
Here is the Java code that is used to open the PDF file:
loPdfDocument = PDDocument.load(this.cFile);
The PDF file contains sensitive information, so I cannot attach it. "
My experience, though, is with a PDF document that was included in the test cases while at SourceForge. At some point, it rendered an image .... but now it errors out with the message Tim provided above.
I will attach that PDF file .... as soon as I find the link to do so.
