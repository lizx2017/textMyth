Summary:
Error in HTML output when detecting paragraph boundaries
Description:
There is an error in paragraph detection in 1.3 version and in current development trunk. In some situations is outputing a non closed <p> tag. It happens in new pages, when - I think - the first paragraph is empty (an empty string).
I attach a quite simple patch for solving this problem, perhaps is not very elegant, but is quite dificult for me to understand paragraph logic in current development trunk.
