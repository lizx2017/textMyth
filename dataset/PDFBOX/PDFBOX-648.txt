Summary:
PdfBox can't be buit from behind a firewall/proxy
Description:
The pdfBox maven build uses ant to fetch resources remotely rather than use maven methods for this. The ant script doesn't respect the maven proxy settings so the script can't be used behind a firewall. This requires explicit proxy settings in the MAVEN_OPTS:
export MAVEN_OPTS="-Dhttp.proxyHost=my.proxyhost -Dhttp.proxyPort=8080"
as this is not the maven way it may confuse many who try to build the source
