Summary:
Incorrect ordering of fatha -- potentially indicative of larger issue with RTL
Description:
On TIKA-2257, Christopher Creutzig shared a file that triggers PDFBox to flip the order of the fatha. I suspect this is happening in normalizeAdd within PDFTextStripper, but I'm not familiar enough with the code to diagnose and fix.
I confirmed this is still happening in trunk.
Triggering file and the start of a diagnosis is available on the Tika issue.
