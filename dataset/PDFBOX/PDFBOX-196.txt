Hi everybody,
I searched for a tool to restrict pdf usage and found
PDFBox. The reason that there are commandlinetools
included put a smile on my face . So I tried the
comandline version of encryt and didn't get what I
expected. I hope someone can help me to solve my problem.
I tried to forbid all except degraded printing with
Encrypt.exe.
I used the following syntax:
Encrypt.exe -O Test -canAssemble false
-canExtractContent false -canExtractForAccessibility
false -canFillInForm false -canModify false
-canModifyAnnotations false -canPrint false
-canPrintDegraded true -keyLength 128 -version 2
-revision 4 test.pdf test-encrypted.pdf
The result was a pdf where printing is completely
forbidden. This I didn't want, so I tried another syntax:
Encrypt.exe -O Test -canAssemble false
-canExtractContent false -canExtractForAccessibility
false -canFillInForm false -canModify false
-canModifyAnnotations false -canPrint true
-canPrintDegraded true -keyLength 128 -version 2
-revision 4 test.pdf test-encrypted.pdf
The result was, that high resulution printing is
allowed, which I also didn't want.
How must the syntax look like to restrict everything
except degraded printing?
Many thanks forward for helping,
TBSC
