Description:
We are not processing the following segment correctly.. I have added the -> and command for clarity
q -> GSave
Q -> QRestore
q -> GSave
W -> ClipNonZeroRule
0 0 m -> MoveTo
612 0 l -> LineTo
612 792 l -> LineTo
0 792 l -> LineTo
h -> ClosePath
n -> EndPath
q -> GSave
612 0 0 792 0 0 cm ->Concatenate
/I13 Do -> Invoke
Q -> QRestore
Q -> QRestore
The problem is 'W' or ClipNonZeroRule. According to the spec 8.5.4
Although the clipping path operator appears before the painting operator, it shall not alter the clipping path at the point where it appears. Rather, it shall modify the effect of the succeeding painting operator. After the path has been painted, the clipping path in the graphics state shall be set to the intersection of the current clipping path and the newly constructed path.
About the n (EndPath) operator
The n operator (see Table 60) is a no-op path-painting operator; it shall cause no marks to be placed on the page, but can be used with a clipping path operator to establish a new clipping path. That is, after a path has been constructed, the sequence W n shall intersect that path with the current clipping path and shall establish a new clipping path.
Currently in ClipNonZeroRule.java and ClipEvenOddRule.java we do
drawer.setClippingPath(GeneralPath.WIND_NON_ZERO);
This applies the current path and resets.
I believe we should ...
drawer.setCurrentWindingRule(GeneralPath.WIND_NON_ZERO);
and
drawer.setCurrentWindingRule(GeneralPath.WIND_NON_ZERO);
and in PageDrawer.java add
int currentWindingRule = -1;
public void setCurrentWindingRule(int windingRule)
{ currentWindingRule=windingRule; }
public void setClippingWindingRule()
{
if(currentWindingRule == -1)
{ return; }
setClippingPath(currentWindingRule);
currentWindingRule=-1;
}
Then in EndPath.java
drawer.setClippingWindingRule();
