Summary:
Limit the CMap-cache to external CMaps
Description:
Antoni Mylka found a potential memory leak within the class PDFont [1]
A static map is used to cache all processed CMaps, which leads after while to a huge amount of allocated memory.
IMO it doesn't make sense to cache embedded CMaps as they are only needed within the font embedding them and those CMaps are already stored in the variable "cmap". We should limit the cache to external CMaps like those which are bundled with pdfbox.
