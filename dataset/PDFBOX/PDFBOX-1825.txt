Summary:
[PATCH] Many pdfbox tests are never run
Description:
The pdfbox tests are run via the TestAll.java which simply adds all the other tests to the test suite. However, the TestAll.java has not been kept up to date, so there are 13 tests which are not run, these are as follows:
/util
TestTextStripperPerformance [FAILS]
TestPDFToImage
TestPDFText2HTML
PageExtractorTest
/pdmodel/graphics/color
PDColorStateTest
/pdmodel/font
TestTTFParser
PDSimpleFontTest
/pdfparser
TestPDFParser [FAILS]
TestNonSequentialPDFParser
ConformingPDFParserTest
/encryption
TestPublicKeyEncryption [FAILS]
/cos
TestCOSBase
TestCOSNumber
I presume that TestAll.java is a legacy file, as Maven is used in all the other sub-projects to run any tests named Test**.java, the solution is propose is:
1. delete AllTests.java
2 .the patch changes pom.xml to run Test**.java files automatically
3. the patch fixes bugs in the TestImageIOUtils and TestTextStripperPerformance tests which threw exceptions because their output folder did not exist
4. the patch disables the TestPDFToImage and TestPublicKeyEncryption which are broken, I will open two new issues for fixing these tests
