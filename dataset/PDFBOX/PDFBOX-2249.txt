Summary:
Listbox controls render incorrectly in Adobe Acrobat or Adobe Reader
Description:
I have a form with a listbox. I update the value in the listbox using the following code:
PDChoiceField c = (PDChoiceField)f;
((PDChoiceField)f).setValue("2");
I have a combo box that uses the same choices, and it works fine. The issue has to do with the rendering of the field. The update of the value (i.e. setValue method) works fine, but when I look at the resulting output PDF the choices have become unreadable because the font has gone way large.
I have searched the mailing list, and posted a question regarding this that no one has answered, so I am now assuming this is an unknown bug.
Thanks
