Summary:
PDF Fields becomes non editable
Description:
Hi, I am new to using PDFBox, so apologies if this is not a bug.
I am using the .net version of PDFBox; I have a PDF File with editable fields, I am trying to read all the field values and write the field values if necessary, reading is fine, but when I write the values to the fields, and save the doc. programatically. The fields become non-editable. Could you please tell me what is going wrong, infact I even set the permission to canFillinForm but it is of no use, my PDF is not password protected.
Also When I open a different PDF file, during Load I am seeing this error - "expected='startxref' actual='3281' org.pdfbox.io.PushBackInputStream@329c933"
Could you please advise me on the above issues?
