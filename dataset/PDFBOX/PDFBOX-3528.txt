Summary:
Converted PDF/A Online validator error
Description:
Good morning, we have a java application that converts a file in pdf / a. If we test at this link http://www.pdf-tools.com/pdf/validate-pdfa-online.aspx we get the following error:
Validating file "ATTO PUBBLICO_PDFA.CONV.pdf" for conformance level pdfa-1b
dc:title/*[0] :: Missing language qualifier.
The document does not conform to the requested standard.
The document's meta data is either missing or inconsistent or corrupt.
Done.
Can you help me?
Thanks
