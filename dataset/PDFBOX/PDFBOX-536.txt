Summary:
missing iterator.hasNext() test in PDFXrefStreamParser
Description:
The class: org.apache.pdfbox.pdfparser.PDFXrefStreamParser
uses an unbounded iterator in it's parser method.
Specifically, line 100 should be changed from:
while(pdfSource.available() > 0)
To
while(pdfSource.available() > 0 && objIter.hasNext())
Not having this check causes line 115 to blow up with a NoSuchElementException.
I will attach a test file that triggers the problem (during Text extraction) and also a patched version of PDFXrefStreamParser.java.
