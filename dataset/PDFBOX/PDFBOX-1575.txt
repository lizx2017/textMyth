Summary:
PDFTextStripper adds spaces after a detached words
Description:
Hello dear developers,
I noticed that PDFTextStripper sometimes adds spaces after a completely detached words...
For example - if you make text extraction for attached file you will se that PDFTextStripper adds one space after words: "Qty " and "Unit Price " but not adds after "Description" and "Line Total".
I think this is a bug, because after words "Qty " and "Unit Price " should not be present the whitespace.
Can you please fix it?
(see attach)
Thank you very much,
Vitalie
