Summary:
Correct validation of Widget Annotations for PDF/A-1
Description:
The TECHNICAL CORRIGENDUM 2 for ISO 19005-1:2005 (PDF/A-1) added a clause for Widget Annotations:
For all annotation dictionaries containing an AP key, the appearance dictionary that it defines as its value shall contain only the N key. If an annotation dictionaryâ€™s Subtype key has a value of Widget and its FT key has a value of Btn, the value of the N key shall be an appearance subdictionary; otherwise the value of the N key shall be an appearance stream.
We currently (only) validate with the original clause of ISO 19005-1:2005 (PDF/A-1) which has
If an annotation dictionary contains the AP key, the appearance dictionary that it defines as its value shall contain only the N key, whose value shall be a stream defining the appearance of the annotation.
