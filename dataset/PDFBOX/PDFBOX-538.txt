Summary:
CryptographyException on Adobe Distiller generated file
Description:
Well... this is actually not a PDFBox bug, but an Adobe Distiller (7.0.x) one...
The following exception is thrown in StandardSecurityHandler.computeEncryptedKey:
org.apache.pdfbox.exceptions.CryptographyException: Error: length should be 5 when revision is two actual=16
The PDF file is accepted by various readers and contains the following object:
2106 0 obj
<<
/Filter /Standard
/V 1
/R 2
/Length 128
/P -12
/O (f¥—èàãØ‡�æa§�»eücmý/Æ6ïàY÷[*™6)
/U (å£átÂ>c÷sÉcû^KÞ•À›¶YjCò~)
>>
endobj
Referenced by an encrypt tag:
/Encrypt 2106 0 R
PDFBox rejects (rightly) such an object with version 1, revision 2 and a length != 5*8
That said, we are parsing many of those files to feed a Lucene index. Could the validation be relaxed ?
