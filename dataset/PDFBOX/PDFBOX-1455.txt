Summary:
wasted work in CIDType0Container.getFontProgramWidth()
Description:
The problem appears in revision 1414743. I attached a three-line
patch that fixes it. This problem and the attached patch are similar
the previously fixed PDFBOX-1447 and its patch.
In method "CIDType0Container.getFontProgramWidth", the loops over
"this.lCFonts" (outer loop) and "cMapping" (inner loop) should break
immediately after "cidFound" is set to "true". All the iterations
after "cidFound" is set to "true" do not perform any useful work, at
best they just set "cidFound" again to "true".
