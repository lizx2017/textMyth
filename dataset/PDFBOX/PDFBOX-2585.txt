Summary:
Can't render PDF with ccitt compressed inline image
Description:
The attached file with inline ccitt encoded images throws a tiff-related exception when rendering. In the attached file, there is an LF that is included in the image stream. (We had a similar problem with stream...endstream when the length is incorrect or not available, see PDFBOX-2079 and PDFBOX-2120). I have several solutions and but will make tests first, not only on my usual files but also on some digitalcorpora files that threw tiff exceptions.
