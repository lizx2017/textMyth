Summary:
getStringWidth is terribly slow (and resulting document is invalid)
Description:
I'm maintaining a PDF layout engine that makes heavy use of "getStringWidth". With PDFBox 2.0.0 this got much slower. So please find attached an example which you can use for profiling purposes. I used "OpenSans" TTF as the basis (grab it at https://github.com/google/fonts/tree/master/apache/opensans).
Beside it being slow, the created PDF cannot be opened (but this may have something to do with PDFBOX-2945 in RC2???)
