Summary:
Performance problem with ResourceLoader while running in WebStart environment
Description:
There is a huge performance impact while running PDFBox with Tika in a WebStart delopyed application.
ResourceLoader.loadRessource() takes almost a third of processing time. It running stabdalone without WebStart, it performs quite fast. I am running JRE 1.7.0_07 on Win7 64bit environment.
I don's know if this is a classpath scanning issue in WebStart or something else with PDFBox, so i file this as a bug.
