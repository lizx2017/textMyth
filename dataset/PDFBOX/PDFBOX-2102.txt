Summary:
Characters swallowed on COSString.getString()
Description:
PDFBOX-1437 seems to have introduced a regression that causes characters like \n to be swallowed when COSString.getString() is called. PDFDocEncoding doesn't handle all valid characters.
testStr = "Line1\nLine2\nLine3\n";
COSString lineFeedString = new COSString(testStr);
assertEquals(testStr, lineFeedString.getString());

//Same as previous but this time as a dictionary value
lineFeedString = new COSString(true);
for (int i = 0; i < testStr.length(); i++) {
    lineFeedString.append(testStr.charAt(i));
}
assertEquals(testStr, lineFeedString.getString()); //currently fails
