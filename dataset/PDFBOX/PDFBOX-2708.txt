Summary:
PDDocument.removePage() deletes the last page regardless of parameter passed
Description:
This can be easily reproduced using provided example
org.apache.pdfbox.examples.pdmodel.RemoveFirstPage that will delete the last page from document instead the first one.
I think this bug was introduced within the last 3 months as my older snapshot build worked fine.
