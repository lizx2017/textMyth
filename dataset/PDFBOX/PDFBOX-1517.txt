Summary:
PDFSplit: split is set to one if no -split argument present
Description:
Wiki http://pdfbox.apache.org/commandlineutilities/PDFSplit.html says that command
PDFSplit -startPage 5 -endPage 10 sample_with_13_pages.pdf
will provide a pdf containing all pages from 5 to 10 of the source pdf.
Instead it provides 5 pdf, each one page long.
From other point local variable startEndPageSet in org.apache.pdfbox.PDFSplit is never set.
