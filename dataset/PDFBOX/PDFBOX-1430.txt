Summary:
Strange connections ( WinAnsiEncoding CMAP file ) while using pdfbox in applet
Description:
When PDFBox is used inside an applet, the applet requests for WinAnsiEncoding CMAP file:
[codebaseurl]/org/apache/pdfbox/resources/cmap/WinAnsiEncoding
where [codebaseurl] is specified as an applet attribute.
The PDFBox tries to download it server times (9 that I have noted so far on windows).
