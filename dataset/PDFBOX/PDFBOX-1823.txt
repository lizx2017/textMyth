Summary:
Apache PDFBox 1.6.0 TextStripper not able to recognise characters having "Frutiger LT - 45" fonts
Description:
When i tried to extract contents from PDF's I am successfully able to extract all text with PDFBox API but getting trouble with fonts having 'Frutiger' style. For these i am getting squared Boxes in place of characters.
It seems PDFBox FontBox supports only 14 UTF characters set And none of them is Frutiger style fonts.
If anybody please can suggest something. That would be of great help. I am in urgent need of the solution.
