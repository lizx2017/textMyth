Summary:
CFFParser uses String constructor without encoding
Description:
The string constructor called in CFFParser#readTagName() should specify an encoding, probably "ISO-8859-1", otherwise it will not work on systems where the default encoding is something "exotic" (we have some with EBCDIC, but I never tried to run PDFBox there). Patch attached.
