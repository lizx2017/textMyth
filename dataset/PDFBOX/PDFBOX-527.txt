Summary:
PageDrawer should set clipping region before drawing text
Description:
When PageDrawer.java strokes or fills a path, or when it draws an image via Invoke or BeginInlineImage, it sets the clipping region of its graphics object prior to drawing. However, when it draws text it doesn't, so a prior image or stroke operation can result in text being clipped. The PDF attached to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PDFBOX-522 displays this when the patch in 522 is applied.
