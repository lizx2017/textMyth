Summary:
Newly added MDP functionality breaks PDFs <1.5
Description:
Changes introduced in PDFBOX-3017, PDFBOX-3699 broke the signing functionality.
A perfectly valid PDF (in 2.0.4) doesn't pass the acrobat preflight test now:
"Incorrect value type for this key" and "general file format error"
"The required key /TransformMethod is missing" and "An unexpected value is associated with the key."
More details see the attached screenshot. I executed the "CreateVisibleSignature.java" code. And if the lines are commented the error is gone.
