Summary:
Incorrect rendering of Slovak language PDF
Description:
Peter Zavadsky reported to PDFBox users' mailing list about unsatisfiable results when trying to perform text extraction from the following Slovak language PDF document:
http://www.justice.gov.sk/kop/ovest/ov10/03/050/OV050A.pdf
While I'm not expert enough to say anything about text extraction, I clearly see numerous rendering problems. Please take a look at the image attachment frontpage.png
Quite obviously, Slovak language makes use of custom character encoding schemes.
