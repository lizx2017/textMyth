Summary:
EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION in fontmanager.dll
Description:
When converting the attached PDF to a PNG using PDFImageWriter.writeImage I receive an EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION in fontmanager.dll. This is similar to PDFBOX-780 but using the PDF attached to that issue doesn't produce the error.
This error doesn't occur with 1.7 but I do get the warning "Could not parse predefined CMAP file for 'Adobe-Identity-UCS'".
