Summary:
currentAccessPermission.setReadOnly() not set in StandardSecurityHandler
Description:
Reported by Joe Ye in the mailing list
While troubleshooting an encryption related issue, I discovered that
currentAccessPermission.setReadOnly() is called in method
pdfbox.pdmodel.encryption.PublicKeySecurityHandler#prepareForDecryption but
NOT in
pdfbox.pdmodel.encryption.StandardSecurityHandler#prepareForDecryption.
Could you please explain why there is the difference? As we're using
StandardSecurityHandler, it appears ReadOnly is never set..
