Summary:
Problem on writing some kind of images to a File in filesystem
Description:
I have an image object which is an instance of PDXObjectImage.
If it has PDIndexed as colorspace.
"image.getColorSpace() instanceof PDIndexed"
the image is wrongly rendered.
Is there any known issue with this colorSpace?
I think the problem could be at:
image.write2file(...) or
image.write2OutputStream(...);
