Summary:
Lines will not be printed (correctly) in case they are part of a clipping mask
Description:
In case of a PDF file that was created with FOP 1.0 and was printed with PDFBox, lines disappeared or lines appeared smaller. PDF files that were created with Adobe InDesign (e.g.) will be printed correctly.
It has something to do with lines which are part of a clipping mask. FOP seems to generate a clipping mask around all kind of borders. Lines of type <fo:leader> appear correctly and are not part of an clipping mask.
When printing a FOP-PDF with PDFBox, PDFBox moves the clipping mask, so the line is not visible anymore. Please see attached Screenshot.
The PDF file I created with FOP is named: original.pdf
The resulting PDF file after printing with PDFBox is named: after_printing_with_pdfbox.pdf
