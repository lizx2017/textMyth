Summary:
TextToPDF drops leading spaces
Description:
We want to use TextToPDF in batch command line mode to convert legacy reports which assume a mono-spaced font, but the PDF files created ignore all leading spaces. Obviously, this messes up column alignment. We can't use the tool without a fix for this. Or is there a parameter we can pass? Here is the command line we are using: java -jar pdfbox-app-1.8.10.jar TextToPDF -standardFont Courier -fontSize 6 gprod.pdf gprod.txt.
I tried downloading 2.0.2, but it is stuck at "WARNING: Building on-disk font cache, this may take a while".
P.S. I am also submitting a second ticket (PDFBOX-3410) regarding the need for orientation control in TextToPDF. Most of our old legacy reports are 128 characters wide and without a Landscape option, they come out wrapped into illegibility.
