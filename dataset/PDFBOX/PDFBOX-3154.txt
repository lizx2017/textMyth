Summary:
PDDocumentCatalog.getDocumentCatalog().getPages().getCount() returns 0 - first page is -1
Description:
The attached PDF opens fine in the readers I have checked, but PDFBox has some issues with it. It apparently has 0 pages, but it is possible to get the first page by asking for page number -1.
Code:
PDDocument pdDocument = PDDocument.load(inputStream);
int pages = pdDocument.getDocumentCatalog().getPages().getCount();
//pages == 0
PDPage page = pdDocument.getDocumentCatalog().getPages().get(-1);
//page != null
This behaviour exists on version 2.0.0.rc2 and on trunk.
