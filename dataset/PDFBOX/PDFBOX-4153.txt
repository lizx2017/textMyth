Summary:
Outlines missing in some versions, not in others
Description:
The outlines are missing in the attached files. There are shown with 2.0.8 and with the trunk and with the first 2.0.9 version tested by Tim and not with the current 2.0.9 version, and not with Adobe Reader. So I can't decide which one is OK. It is likely related to the recent change, e.g. PDFBOX-4084.
