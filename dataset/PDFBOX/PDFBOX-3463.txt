Summary:
XMPSchemaBasic.getLabel() always returns null
Description:
It seems that while the Label is being saved correctly with setlabel() it is impossible to read it back.
Looking at the source
    public void setLabel( String label )
    {
        setTextProperty( prefix + ":Label", label );
    }
    
    public String getLabel()
    {
        return getTextProperty( prefix + "p:Label" );
    }
It is quite obvious that the problem is the p in "p:Label" .
