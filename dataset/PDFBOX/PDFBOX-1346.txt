Summary:
Can't assign an arbitrary string value to an editable acroform combobox
Description:
If the field flags "Combo" and "Edit" of an acro form choice field are both set, the field is an editable combo box and can hold arbitrary string values. See ISO32000-1:2008 Section 12.7.4.4 "Choice Fields", Table 230 "Field flags specific to choice fields".
Problem:
The implementation of the method org.apache.pdfbox.pdmodel.interactive.form.PDChoiceField#setValue(String) does not check for the special case of an editable combo box and raises an exception, if you try to set a value not in the options list.
The provided patch fixes the problem.
