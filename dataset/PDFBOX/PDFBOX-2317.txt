Summary:
ZapfDingbats should use its own glyph list
Description:
Rendering the file from PDFBOX-2307-159827 (p2) results in the log message:
WARNING: No Unicode mapping for a73 (1) in font ZapfDingbats
The reason is that Zapf Dingbats doesn't use the Adobe Glyph List, it uses its own special glyph list. This is part of the PDF spec, and the download can be found at http://sourceforge.net/adobe/aglfn/wiki/Home/
We need to make use of this glyph list specifically for the ZapfDingbats font, the most flexible approach is probably to have GlyphList instances associated with PDFonts.
