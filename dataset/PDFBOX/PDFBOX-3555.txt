Summary:
FlateFilter.decode cause native memory leaks
Description:
The FlateFilter.decode method calls the private method FlateFilter.decompress which instanciates a java.util.zip.Inflater.
But this method never calls the Inflater.end method so I think the native memory allocated by the Inflater is never released.
By consequence, the java process memory size keeps growing over time.
The simplest way we found to fix this is to call the Inflater.end when the inflater has done its job and is not used anymore at the end of FlateFilter.decompress.
With this fix, the java process memory size remains stable over time.
Just ask me if more details are needed.
