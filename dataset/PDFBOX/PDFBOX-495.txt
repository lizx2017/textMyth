Summary:
PDFTextStripperByArea extracts text only from 1 region, despite several regions being defined
Description:
When trying to extract the text from several areas defined in the PDFTextStripperByArea, it only
retrieves the text from one. The problem can be seen with the following steps:
Divide a page in 4 regions and add the regions to the stripper in
the following order:
1-upper left, 2-upper right, 3-lower left, 4-lower right.
After calling "extractRegions" function, only the text for the third
one is retrieved.
If the third region is not added (i.e., only regions 1, 2 and 4 are added), only the text for region 2 is retrieved.
