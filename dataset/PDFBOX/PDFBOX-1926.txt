Summary:
Document.save() after Document.close() causes Null Pointer Exception
Description:
Until version 1.8.3 it was possible to perform a document's save()-call also if the document's close()-method has already been called. In my opinion this made sense as I'd like to persist the document's content also if no more (content changing) operations are performed on it.
Anyway, in 1.8.4, calling save() after close() causes a NullPointerException:
Caused by: java.lang.NullPointerException
