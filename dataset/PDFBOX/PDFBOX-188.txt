Hi,
I've tried to extract text from attached PDF using
both stable release PDFBox-0.7.2 and recent nightly
build PDFBox-0.7.3-dev-20060809 and the following code
snipped:
// 1. parse document
PDFParser parser = new PDFParser(is);
parser.parse();
cos = parser.getDocument();
// 2. extract text
PDFTextStripper stripper = new PDFTextStripper();
String text = stripper.getText(new PDDocument(cos));
// 3. dump output
FileOutputStream os = new FileOutputStream("file.txt");
OutputStreamWriter ow = new
OutputStreamWriter(os, "UTF-8");
ow.write(text);
ow.flush();
Despite of russian contents of original PDF, the
output file doesn't contain any "valid" russian
character(s).
I've also tried to convert the same PDF with the
foolabs-xpdf tool - the output contains valid
UTF-8 russian text.
PS: I couldn't attach file because of sourcecforge
size limit. (the size is ~545K). Is it possible
to pass it to dev. team ?
