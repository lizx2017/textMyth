Summary:
Extra new line characters extracted in 1.8.5 for embedded files leading to ZipFile exception in Java 1.6
Description:
For the test file I'll attach shortly, PDFBox 1.8.4 extracts 17660 bytes from an embedded zip (well, docx) file. PDFBox 1.8.5 extracts 17662 bytes â€“ "\r\n" at the end of the stream. This leads to a ZipException for ZipFile(s) in Java 1.6, but not Java 1.7.
