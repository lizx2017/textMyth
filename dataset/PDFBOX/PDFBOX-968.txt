Summary:
Writing text into existing PDF - extra spaces between characters on some pages of the PDF
Description:
I used PDFBox to add text into existing PDF documents (kind of text stamping).
For some pages of PDF, the space/gap between letters/characters of the text is much wider !
I cannot explain how/why it happens ?!
Sample of my code:
contentStream.beginText();
contentStream.setNonStrokingColor(colorText);
contentStream.setFont(pdfFont, fontSize);
contentStream.moveTextPositionByAmount(xText, yText);
contentStream.drawString(messageStamp);
contentStream.endText();
