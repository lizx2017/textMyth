Summary:
Add an API to get the COSObjectKey of a given object
Description:
When debugging it's useful to be able to get an indirect COS object's generation and id numbers. However, for PD objects there's no way to retrieve the COSObject which points to the result of getCOSObject().
Only COSDocument contains this information, so I'm adding a new method which looks up the COSObjectKey for a given COSBase, assuming that object is indirect (e.g. the target of a COSObject).
