Summary:
Newly created XRef stream has direct root objects
Description:
To investigate PDFBOX-3026 I wanted to create a small file with an XRef stream by calling doc.getDocument().setIsXRefStream(true);, but got a /Root entry with direct contents, instead of "/Root 1 0 R". This has never occured before, because when saving loaded files, the COSObject in-between is kept.
18 0 obj

stream
I'll make an appropriate change in PDFXRefStream to change this.
