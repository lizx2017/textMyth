Summary:
OCG Layers partly lost after merge
Description:
Merge the attached file with itself and open with Adobe Reader and zoom out so that both pages can be seen. The layer UI has an effect on the first page but not on the second.
I suspect that the cause is that in the resource properties, the names (short and long) are the same, but the object numbers are different.
