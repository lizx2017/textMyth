Summary:
Create example with empty signature
Description:
Motivation from the mailing list:
I got fillable PDF working with interactive forms examples. I also 
have added a button in the PDF, I want to add the signature image (as 
in signature example) on click of that button (see attached). Once 
signature is in place, I want to remove the button and save the PDF. 
Is this something possible? Does anyone have working example of the same?
