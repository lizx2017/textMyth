Summary:
Problem setting custom appearance on PDAnnotationRubberStamp
Description:
I'm trying to generate a RubberStamp with a custom appearance in a PDF. I wrote the following test-code: it saves the document and I can find the image inside the pdf, by examinating the structures. But the Rubberstamp isn't shown within the PDF when opened with the Reader.
I made a second PDF using Acrobat Pro with the same stamp - there I can see the stamp when opening with a Reader.
Here is the test-code I wrote:
(I came to this solution by analyzing the structure of a manually set custom RubberStamp from the Acrobat Pro document):
//Generating a new document and adding a new page
PDDocument document = new PDDocument();
PDPage page = new PDPage();
document.addPage(page);
//Get all annotations
List annotations = page.getAnnotations();
//Generate a new RubberStamp
PDAnnotationRubberStamp aRubber = new PDAnnotationRubberStamp();
aRubber.setName("fancy_name");
aRubber.setContents("This is the content of the generated stamp!");
//Generate a custom appearance for the RubberStamp
FileInputStream fin = new FileInputStream("fancyImage.jpg");
PDJpeg mypic = new PDJpeg(document,fin);
PDResources myResources = new PDResources();
myResources.getXObjects().put("Im0", mypic);
COSStream s = new COSStream(document.getDocument().getScratchFile());
s.createUnfilteredStream();
PDAppearanceStream myDic = new PDAppearanceStream(s);
myDic.setResources(myResources);
PDAppearanceDictionary appearance = new PDAppearanceDictionary(new COSDictionary());
appearance.setNormalAppearance(new HashMap<String, COSObjectable>());
appearance.getNormalAppearance().put("default", myDic);
//Set the appearance of the RubberStamp to the custom look
aRubber.setAppearance(appearance);
//Define and set the target rectangle
PDRectangle myrect = new PDRectangle();
myrect.setUpperRightX(250);
myrect.setUpperRightY(550);
myrect.setLowerLeftX(275);
myrect.setLowerLeftY(575);
aRubber.setRectangle(myrect);
//Add the new RubberStamp to the document
annotations.add(aRubber);
// Finally write the new file and close it
document.save("output_final.pdf");
document.close();
