Summary:
Trailer Dictionary object labeled "Size" is overwritten when there are 2 xref table objects
Description:
While parsing a linearized PDF file, all of which have 2 distinct xref tables in different locations in the file, I noticed that the Size entry in the dictionary was being overwritten to the wrong value. The value that should be used for these files is the number in the first trailer section which represents the size of all the entries.
