Summary:
Text rendered as question marks
Description:
The text in the PDF file from PDFBOX-1895 is rendered as question marks. The file in question has a number of missing fonts and CMAPs. Acrobat can display it but OS X Preview cannot and Chrome does a poor job.
We should probably be throwing some sort of exception as this file cannot possibly render correctly. Alternatively, we can try to repair the file or find the missing fonts.
