Summary:
PDAcroForm flatten() throws ClassCastException
Description:
In the PDAcroForm class, in the flatten() method, there is a for loop that tries casting field to a PDTerminalField. But, the field is sometimes a PDNonTerminalField and the casting error is thrown.
To fix this I just add one if statement right before the for loop that checks to see if field is an instance of PDTerminalField and place the for loop inside the if statement:
if(field instanceof PDTerminalField){
