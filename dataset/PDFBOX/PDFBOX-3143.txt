Summary:
Added PDEmbeddedFile constructor with COSName parameter
Description:
Since the "addCompression" method from PDStream got deprecated and instead the "PDStream" constructor with "COSName" parameter should be used, please also provide this constructor in all classes derived from "PDStream" where it makes sense (especially in "PDEmbeddedFile")
