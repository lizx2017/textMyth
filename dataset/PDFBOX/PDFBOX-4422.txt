Summary:
PDF with OutputIntent with alternative colorspace with incorrect component count validates
Description:
as reported by "a20god", copied from linked VeraPDF issue:
==
The Alternate entry of the output intent's DestOutputProfile (which is not to be ignored in PDF/A-1, in contrast to PDF/A-2)
is a device color space which violates 6.2.3.3 (DeviceCMYK vs. RGB output intent)
does not have the same number of components as the ICC profile (4 vs. 3), see PDF Reference 1.4 Table 4.16.
