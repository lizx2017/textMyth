Summary:
Document Outlines (Bookmark) and Link Annotation validation do not validate /Dest item
Description:
The BookmarkValidationProcess and LinkAnnotationValidator classes does not validate the /Dest item. It should do so like is already done in GoToAction.
Destinations may be associated with outline items (see Section 8.2.2, "Document Outline"), annotations ("Link Annotations" on page 622), or actions ("Go-To Actions" on page 654 and "Remote Go-To Actions" on page 655).
