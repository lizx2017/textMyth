Summary:
Setting a value on a PDRadioCollection fails

If a PDRadioCollection is instantiated for a group of radio
buttons that have no default value selected, the setValue
call fails when the PDCheckbox.getOnValue() method is
invoked. If the same group of Radio Buttons is modified
so that one of them is the default selection, the code
executes without error and the value is set successfully.
Simplified Example (See attached file):
Field: Applicant.Gender
Export Value 1: Male
Export Value 2: Female
PDRadioCollection Gender
theForm.getField(Applicant.Gender);
Gender.setValue("Male"); <--Exception Thrown
Thanks.

The fix that you describe uses a try catch NPE block, I would
like to try to come up with a better solution. I don't see that
file on the FTP site, can you try to upload it again.

This issue is resolved as well, with no additional code
change. After I implemented a resolution to Bug 1178668,
this issue went away. So it would seem that the lack of a
default value was not the true cause of the error, more it was
the processing of the kids as that default value was searched
for.

Uploading file to ftp.pdfbox.org
called "RadioButtons_NoDefault.pdf" because the upload as
an attachment to this report failed beacause the size
restrictions were exceeded.
Sorry for any confusion.
