Summary:
PDocument corrupts file
Description:
I have a file (attached) that when loaded with PDocument.load and then saved to another location simply saves as a blank PDF. The number of pages is correct, but when opened in Acrobat, all the page names are corrupted and the pages are blank.
Here's the code:
PDDocument doc = PDDocument.load("/home/jnankin/Desktop/in.pdf");
doc.save("/home/jnankin/Desktop/out.pdf");
doc.close();
Please advise.
