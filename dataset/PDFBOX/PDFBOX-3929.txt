Summary:
Border style dictionary width ignored by Adobe Reader when float
Description:
Text of bug report to adobe:
Steps to reproduce bug:
1. Assign border style width 3.0 to each field widget with Apache PDFBox
2. Open PDF with Adobe Reader
Results:
Border is not of width 3
Expected results:
Border should be of width 3. However if the same is done programmatically with 3 as an integer (i.e. 3 instead of 3.0) it works. However the PDF 32000 specification clearly tells that the width in the border style dictionary is a "number". It does not request an integer. See Table 166 â€“ Entries in a border style dictionary.
Sadly I can attach only one file. Both files are also in this bug report:
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PDFBOX-3929
The files are named
BorderWidthTest3.0float.pdf (attach here too)
and
BorderWidthTest3int.pdf (displays correctly)
I have observed this effect only for the attached file (from Garry Grosso in the user mailing list). The effect does not happen with Annotations.
Code used:
        PDDocument doc = PDDocument.load(new File("BorderWeightTest.pdf"));
        PDAcroForm acroForm = doc.getDocumentCatalog().getAcroForm();
        for (PDField field : acroForm.getFieldTree())
        {
            System.out.println(field);
            if (field instanceof PDTextField)
            {
                PDBorderStyleDictionary bs = new PDBorderStyleDictionary();
                bs.setWidth(3);
                ((PDTextField)field).getWidgets().get(0).setBorderStyle(bs);
            }
        }
                
        doc.save(new File("BorderWeightTest-new.pdf"));
        doc.close();
