Hi Ben,
I was going through the Pdf file conversion by the acrobat
professional. One difference i observed between the
extraction of text by acrobat professional and PDFBox is
that while exracting the text from the pdf file, the
PDFBox extracts even the text from the image object if
there is some text present, but the acrobat doesn't do
that it eliminates the text which is present in the
images. So that makes the difference. When we start
extract the text from the images if there is some text
which is in a non-ascii format then that text is
represented as a box because it is extracted as it from
the image. The acrobat avoids this type of extraction and
does not give any box.
This is only my view if i am wrong thn please excuse me.
I am waiting for your reply on this.
Thanking you
Regards,
Govardhana

Hi Ben,
Even i am facing the same problem. Sometimes when i try to
extract the PDF file content the extracted text contains
boxes which doesn't give me any idea of they mean. When i
tried to extract the same pdf file using the acrobat
professional the whole text which contained boxes was
eliminated and the rest of the text content was extracted.
I wanted to know whether any remedy as been found or can u
help to do the same what the acrobat professional does.
Thank You
Regards,
Govardhan
