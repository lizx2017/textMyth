Summary:
Form Fields missing values (values are NULL)
Description:
When using getValue() to get the field value in PDFs, getValue() returns NULL. Even though the document, when opened in evince or in acroread shows the form fields correctly filled in (and the commandline pdftk utility also correctly grabs the form values). Using the precompiled commandline pdfbox app to bring up the PDFDebugger, the affected fields do not have any values, so I can't even try to grab the values "manually" by parsing the COSDictionary.
Also affects PDFBox 1.6.0.
Sample PDF triggering this issue in 90% of the form fields:
http://www.cnf.cornell.edu/doc/New_User_Application_-_Cornell.pdf
Grab it, fill it out with Acrobat Reader, then try to get the field values.
