Summary:
A text including single-quote is malformed with Embedded TTF font
Description:
When a text including single quote is output by an embedded TTF font, it turns into garbage. This can be reproduced by an attached code.
This is because the cid code of single quote is 0x0A and escaped in COSWriter.writeString(). The attached patch fixes this.
