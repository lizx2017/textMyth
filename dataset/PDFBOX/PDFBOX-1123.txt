Summary:
Not able to read field values from a PDF File if the field contains special characters.
Description:
Hi, I am trying to read the field names in a PDF file, it is working with most of the files, but in some files we are not able to read the field Id/name, the reason being we have some field names as -
topmostSubform[0].Page1[0].c1_04_0_[0]
topmostSubform[0].Page1[0].c1_09_0_
topmostSubform[0].Page2[0].Table_Line4a[0].#subform[1].p2-t69[0]
Here all the field names starts with topmostSubform[0]. so when we try to get the field names like PDField.getpartialname() - the field name is getting truncated at '.' and we get only - topmostSubform[0] and since all the field names starts with the same name the total count of fields are coming as 1. Since there are some special characters like '.'; '_'; '#' this is causing the issue. Could you please suggest on this? This is very critical.
