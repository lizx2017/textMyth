Summary:
In some cases PDPage converttoimage is extremely slow
Description:
I convert hundreds of documents with an average of some seconds per page. One type of documents takes several minutes per page.
It is not linked to the size of the document: I extracted one page and generated the image on its own.
It is not linked to the fonts, because I have the same content in another document (A6 format instead of A4), and there I don't have a problem.
