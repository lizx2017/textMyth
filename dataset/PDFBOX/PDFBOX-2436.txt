Summary:
Parsing error
Description:
PDDocument.load method returns without exception, but document model is incomplete.
You can try it by this code on attached file:
PDDocument document = PDDocument.load(new File(inFN), null);
int size = document.getSignatureDictionaries().size();
System.out.println("Signatures count:" +size);
Output is 1, but there are two signatures in PDF document.
PDFParser.class produces IOException and ignores it on line 196. Rest of the document is ignored.
loadNoSeq method works, but I cannot use it, because I want to attach a new signature.
