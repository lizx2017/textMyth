Summary:
Ignore IllegalArgumentException when reading an ICCProfile
Description:
A "java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Invalid ICC Profile Data" is thrown from PDICCBase#loadICCProfile() when rendering the attached PDF. The code already checks for and ignores ProfileDataException and CMMException at this place.
IllegalArgumentException is thrown if the profile header data is completely corrupt, either there is not even the 128 header bytes or the profile size found in header does not match the size of data.
The exception is ignored in 1.8, in 2.0 it is re-thrown. I think ignoring the exception and using an alternate color space is better and consistent with the handling of the other two expected exceptions.
