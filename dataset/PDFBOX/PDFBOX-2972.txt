Summary:
Exception when RenderingIntent value is not one of the predefined.
Description:
Hello!
Due to pdf specification there are four possible rendering intents : RelativeColorimetric, AbsoluteColorimetric, Perceptual or Saturation. But also there's a remark that "If the viewer application does not
recognize the specified name, it uses the RelativeColorimetric intent by default."
PDFBox throws exception while encountering unknown RenderingIntent which seems to be incorrect behavior.
Look at org.apache.pdfbox.pdmodel.graphics.state.RenderingIntent.fromString
