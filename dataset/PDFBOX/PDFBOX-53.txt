I am getting a NullPointerException from
PDRadioCollection.getValue (). It seems that my radio
collection dictionaries don't have kids so the
kids.size () call fails:
Line 131:
for (int i = 0; i < kids.size(); i++)
{
PDCheckbox btn = (PDCheckbox)kids.get;
if( btn.isChecked() )
{ retval = btn.getOnValue(); }
}
if( retval == null )
{ retval = getDictionary().getNameAsString( "V" ); }
I added a check for null value of kids and things
behaved properly. If you need a sample PDF that shows
this behaviour, I'll upload one.
Cheers,
Nathan
