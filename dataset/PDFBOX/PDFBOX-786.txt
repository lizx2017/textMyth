Summary:
PDChoiceField's implementation of SetValue does not work for all PDF forms. Sometimes it throws ClassCastException
Description:
For a choice with the following options:
COSArray{[COSString{ }, COSArray{[COSString
{NR}
, COSString
{Non-reactive}
]}, COSArray{[COSString
{R}
, COSString
{Reactive}
]}, COSArray{[COSString
{Declined}, COSString{Declined}
]}]}
A class cast is thrown as the code expects all items to be strings as the first item is a string. However, the remaining items are all pairs.
The attached code is the fix. It just makes the pair/single check every time through the loop.
