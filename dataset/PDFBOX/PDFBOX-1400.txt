Summary:
Polygon objects added to existing page are not shown in Adobe Reader
Description:
I have PDF file which I tried to draw some polygons to.
content.setLineWidth(0.3f);
content.setStrokingColor(Color.RED);
content.drawPolygon(new float[]
{x1, x2, x2, x1}
, new float[]
{y2, y2, y1, y1}
);
I have tested several PDF files. Those polygons are properly shown in Adobe Reader for most of PDF files.
But there are some PDF files which ignores this and Adobe Reader won't show any polygons that were drawn.
