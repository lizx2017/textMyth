Summary:
DateConverter needs to work
Description:
Most of the tests for org/apache/pdfbox/util/DateConverter.java in src/test/java/org/apache/pdfbox/util/TestDateUtil.java have been commented out. DateConverter was broken.
The attached patch fixes the problems. Extensive comments document the problems. Here's a copy:
/* the former version of DateConverter had these bugs:
- In toISO8601 the conversion from millis to minutes was with 1000/1000;
should have been 1000/60.
- PDFBox-402 was not completely implemented. The calendar fields in the
POTENTIAL_FORMATS are shared among threads. Hence we must create new
SimpleThreadFormats for each test. (Or synchronize somehow).
- Some formats with hh did not have an a field. I changed them to HH.
these questionable features:
- A timezone with neither plus sign nor minus is assumed to be minus.
This seems wrong, but I have not changed it.
- toCalendar() returned a value in the default Locale.
PDF files do not have locales (I think) and even if they do
there is no reason to assume the Java default.
I have switched to Locale.ENGLISH which was already assumed
in the date formats and toString.
and these infelicities:
- Constants 60 and 1000 appeared.
- zeroAppend was not used where applicable.
In one case it was inapplicable only because TimeZone.getOffset
was suspected of returning a long. It does not.
- Manually computed constants were used to in date.substring
thus reducing flexibility and maintainability.
- The TimeZone name reported by toCalendar was always "Unknown"
It is easy enough to compute a name.
- Time zones were not accepted with most of the alternate parsing formats.
The new code allows a timezone after any format.
