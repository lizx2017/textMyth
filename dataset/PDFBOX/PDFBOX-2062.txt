Summary:
Setting a PDFFormField's value with a specific font size causes the font size to change on click
Description:
Setting the font size of a PDField causes the font size to change on click on the field. It starts out with incorrect font size. When the field is clicked, it displays in the font size correctly. Clicking outside the field, reverts back to the incorrect font size.
This behavior was also mentioned in PDFBOX-1419 in passing.
Code:
pdfFormField.getDictionary.setString(COSName.DA, "/Helv 10 Tf 0 g”)
pdfFormField.setValue("Hello”)
A simple example of such a PDF is here.
