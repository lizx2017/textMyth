Summary:
Parsing of a Type1 font fails with a ClassCastException
Description:
A ClassCastException is reported in Type1CharStringParser while rendering the attached PDF. The PDF was rendered correctly in 1.7.x where the fonts were read using AWT, I did not try with latest 1.8.x.
Note: The PDF is just one of my test suite files, not a production problem. I am not sure whether the PDF or the parser is wrong, but I assume the later as Acrobat and PDFBox 1.7.x (AWT) are able to read it correctly.
