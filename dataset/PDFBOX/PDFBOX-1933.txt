Summary:
PDFParser loops infinitely when loaded by JSP instead of NetBeans
Description:
I wrote a class to split large PDF files into segments, using NetBeans. When I run it as a local project, it works perfectly. It uses PDFParser to read the file input stream and output the document, so I can strip annotations and other stuff out and upload it to my database. The code is as follows:
PDFParser pdfParser = new PDFParser( inputStream );
pdfParser.parse();
return pdfParser.getDocument();
The PDFParser works when I run it as a standalone Java package. As soon as I embed it in a JSP, it loops forever. I get no error messages of any kind, but I can see that my Java processes are increasing in size, and that the file I'm working on (the original PDF) is locked by the OS. I have to shut down Java altogether to delete or rename it.
I have no idea what the difference is when it is when it is run by a JSP calling the class file. If there is a simple solution and this is a repeat of the old infinite loop bug, could someone point me in the right direction? I have scoured the net looking for solutions, but I've had no luck.
