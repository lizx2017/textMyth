Originally submitted by tamirhassan on 2005-06-07 13:54.
In the file attached, the text on the entire right-hand side
of the page is extracted as TextPosition objects with a
negative horizontal position.
This is, in fact, a single page extracted from a multi-
page document (which is included here to conserve
space.) In the complete document, this problem occurs
on certain pages, but not others.
Another user also seems to have had a somewhat
similar problem, although I'm not sure if it referred to a
negative X position, or just a negative string width. I did
not find a resolution on the forum:

Thanks in advance for any help you can offer,
