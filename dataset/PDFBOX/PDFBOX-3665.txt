Summary:
PDFBox text and images are blurry on HiDPI display
Description:
See the JDK issue https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8169976
The same problem can also be seen with the Apache PDFBOX debugger-app-2.0.3.jar (get it at https://pdfbox.apache.org/download.cgi ), run
java -jar pdfbox-app-2.0.3.jar PDFReader <pdf filename>
The application frame is larger than in jdk8. Displaying a PDF (you can drag a file or open it in the menu) shows the same weird effects with glyphs.
