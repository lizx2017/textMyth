Summary:
PDF loader causes infinite loop on non-PDF inputs
Description:
The current SVN head for the pdfbox incubator will experience an infinite loop in PDFParser.parseHeader() if you feed any non-PDF document to the parser. The problem is that it tries to find the PDF header within the document by skipping over any non-matching lines which don't start with a numeric digit. It relies on a readLine() function from BaseParser.java which will return an empty string when the stream is at the end-of-file. The parseHeader() call will loop on these empty lines.
I've patched this in our system by throwing an IOException from BaseParser.readLine() if the stream is already at the end-of-file at the beginning of that call.
