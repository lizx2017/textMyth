Summary:
Missing stream in /XrefStm causes parse to break
Description:
When the pdf document contains a startref and xref table (a la PDF1.4) as well as an /XRefStm, but the offset given by /XRefStm does not describe a xref (stream or otherwise), PDFBox does its level best to find the xref info using a brute force search. In the case where the document only contains the xref table given by startxref, and does not contain an object of /Type /XRef, the brute force search results in the xref table.
See diffs for COSParser.java(2.0.0) and NonSequentialPDFParser.java (1.8.9), below.
