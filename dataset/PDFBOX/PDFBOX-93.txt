Hi Ben,
While debugging a problem I had I found the following
line in the method FlateFilter.decode():
if (predictor==-1 || predictor == 1 && predictor == 10)
This is on line 95. Shouldn't the && operator be a || ?
cheers
Yves

I agree with reporter yves_bussard that the && in line 94 is
highly likely supposed to be ||. Clearly, the three-boolean
statement has no non-trivial meaning, even with parentheses.
The Fifth Edition (PDF 1.6) states the following about the
possible value of (what is in that Java code) the variable
"predictor":
1 No prediction (the default value)
2 TIFF Predictor 2
10 PNG prediction (on encoding, PNG None on all rows)
11 PNG prediction (on encoding, PNG Sub on all rows)
12 PNG prediction (on encoding, PNG Up on all rows)
13 PNG prediction (on encoding, PNG Average on all rows)
14 PNG prediction (on encoding, PNG Paeth on all rows)
15 PNG prediction (on encoding, PNG optimum)
(Table 3.8, page 52) The value 10 isn't very significant;
though it flags the data as PNG, it declares that there is
no prediction. The value 1 is the canonical declaration that
there is no prediction. Thus it seems quite normal that -1,
1 and 10 (-1 being the default in the code) all go down the
same code path.
As it stands in 0.7.3, the "else" branch that start line 102
never gets executed, yet it seems to deal with images. So
while I don't have a sample file on hand, it would seem that
some particular encodings of PNG images may trigger a
problem by going down a path with no prediction even though
they require a predictor function. (I don't know what the
0.7.4 code looks like.)

This line actually is not the source of my problem. I just
stumbled over it. It is a logical problem (or I really need
to start learning java again from scratch): How can a
variable be equal to 1 AND 10. The line just doesn't make sense.

The predictor section of code was actually a contribution, so I
will need to take a little while to verify what is going on. Can
you attach/upload a PDF that exhibits this issue?
