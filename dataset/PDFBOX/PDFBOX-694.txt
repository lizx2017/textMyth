Summary:
When extract text, the title showing in incorrectness position.
Description:
1. When I call PDFTextStripper to extract text from the PDF file (000001_2005_1_9.pdf). I get the title at the end of the text document. The result is 'beforetrim.txt'.
2. The bug are:
2.1 The title text is at the end of the text. It is in the begin of the document (Snapshot.png).
2.2 There is white space between the number, but in the adobe read show (Snapshot.png), there is no any space.
2.3 The page footer is at the start of the text (beforetim.txt).
