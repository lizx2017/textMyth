Summary:
Preflight 2.0.0 doesn't properly identify PDFs with encryption
Description:
For PDFs that contain encryption, Preflight 2.0.0 now returns the following error code/message:
1.0 : Syntax error
Here's an example file:
https://github.com/openplanets/format-corpus/raw/master/pdfCabinetOfHorrors/encryption_nocopy.pdf
Previous versions would give more specific info in such cases (e.g. 1.4.2 / Trailer Syntax error, The trailer dictionary contains Encrypt).
The other 'encyption_' files below show the same behavior:
