Summary:
ExtractImages doesn't extract images from PDPatterns
Description:
The ExtractImages tool (or the underlying PDFGraphicsStreamEngine) doesn't extract images from PDPattern objects, even if they are shown on the page. We've found that Win2PDF stores images in such patterns. I have attached a sample file that this tool has generated from the Angular website. The sample clearly shows many images, but ExtractImages finds none of these.
