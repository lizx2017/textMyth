Description:
(Continuation of https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PDFBOX-2617)
A group of radio-buttons is an object of the PDRadioCollection class and each child of that group is an PDCheckbox object.
However, if the group only contains one widget the getKids method of the PDRadioCollection object returns null.
There should be at least one child for any such group.
