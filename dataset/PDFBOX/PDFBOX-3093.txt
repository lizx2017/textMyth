Summary:
Exception in TTFParser
Description:
The reason for this is an ambiguity in the TrueType specification. Namely, one of the font tables (OS/2) is present in the font directory with length 0. The specification itself is completely silent about this.
The only other information I was able to find is:
the FreeType font library (http://www.freetype.org/freetype2/docs/reference/ft2-truetype_tables.html#FT_Sfnt_Table_Info) assumes that any table having 0 length in the font directory is treated as missing.
Google OpenType Sanitizer would report an error in such situation: https://github.com/khaledhosny/ots/blob/master/src/ots.cc, lines 575-578
there are several related discussions at Adobe forums: https://forums.adobe.com/thread/1616317 , https://forums.adobe.com/thread/1611899
As allowing zero length tables in TrueType fonts seems to be quite logical (and also implicitly confirmed by Adobe Acrobat validator), I've changed the TTFParser to skip tables with 0 length.
Attaching patch and font file. Will add test file also if necessary.
