Summary:
TextPosition.getX() and getY() do not work properly with CropBox
Description:
TextPosition.getX() and getY() are supposed to calculate position relative to upper left corner of page.
When PDF contains CropBox then these functions return incorrect values. CropBox is ignored.
Text is relative to CropBox coordinates but calculations are made only with pageWidth and pageHeight, and that is wrong.
"page" in function description means MediaBox or CropBox?
