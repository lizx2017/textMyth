Summary:
Maven repository points to incorrect snapshot version
Description:
Looking at the maven repository 
  https://repository.apache.org/content/groups/snapshots/org/apache/pdfbox/pdfbox-parent/1.8.14-SNAPSHOT/maven-metadata.xml
  Latest version points to 1.8.14-20180226.173300-46
But that version is not available in the repository, a different version is available
https://repository.apache.org/content/groups/snapshots/org/apache/pdfbox/pdfbox-parent/1.8.14-SNAPSHOT/pdfbox-parent-1.8.14-20180226.173259-46.pom
Same buildnumber but different timestamp
  This results in failing downloads
