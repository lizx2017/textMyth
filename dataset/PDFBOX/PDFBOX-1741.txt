Summary:
[PATCH] Text should be in italic but is rendered upright
Description:
See attached PDF. The embedded font has a FontMatrix with skew values to make the font look italic. It's not taken into account by PDFBox.
In PageDrawer and CFFGlyph2D there are a lot of manual modifications of the y coordinate to convert from the PDF coordinate system to AWT. This can be avoided by applying an initial transform to the Graphics2D instance. That allows to simplify the code quite a bit.
