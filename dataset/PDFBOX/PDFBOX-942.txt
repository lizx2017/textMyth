Summary:
Image quality improvements
Description:
The quality of the images inserted in a PDF documents could be improved by changing PDJpeg.java
In the API
public PDJpeg(PDDocument doc, BufferedImage bi) throws IOException
ImageIO.write(bi, "jpeg", os);
could be replaced by :
ImageWriter writer = null;
Iterator iter = ImageIO.getImageWritersByFormatName("jpg");
if (iter.hasNext())
{ writer = (ImageWriter) iter.next(); }
ImageOutputStream ios = ImageIO.createImageOutputStream(os);
writer.setOutput(ios);
// Set the compression quality
JPEGImageWriteParam iwparam = new JPEGImageWriteParam(Locale.getDefault());
iwparam.setCompressionMode(ImageWriteParam.MODE_EXPLICIT);
iwparam.setCompressionQuality(1.0f);
// Write the image
writer.write(null, new IIOImage(bi, null, null), iwparam);
writer.dispose();
This increase the size of the generated PDF.
By default the JPEG quality is 0.75, in the patch I use 1.0, the maximum quality
As a suggestion the quality of the JPEG could be a global variable since it affect the size of the PDF
