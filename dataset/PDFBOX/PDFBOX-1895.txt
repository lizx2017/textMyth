Summary:
Type0 settings /Registry and /Ordering are not decrypted when writing document
Description:
When re-writing a document with font descriptions, Adobe Reader is unable to display the fonts in the document. Reader can display the fonts in the original document. The difference is that in the original document, the font descriptions are in lower object numbers than the font references; in the output document, the font descriptions are in higher object numbers than the font references. Is there a quick way to re-order them?
Update: the PDF file in question is actually corrupt, but somehow modifying it with PDFBox causes it to no longer be readable with Adobe Reader.
Update: The position of the objects in the document is not important, and is not the issue. Whether the file is corrupt or not according to preflight tools is not the issue. The problem is that the input document is encrypted, including the /Registry and /Ordering settings on the Type0 font, and the output document is not, however the encrypted strings are copied verbatim to the output document, despite having decrypted copies in use for the CMap of the PDType0Font.
