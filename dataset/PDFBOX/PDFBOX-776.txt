Summary:
Text extraction gibberish after ghostscript update
Description:
I have a test pdf document that is generated using ps2pdf from ghostscript.
If I use ghostscript 8.70 then pdfbox will correctly extract the text
If I use ghostscript 8.71 then pdfbox will not correctly extract the text (same byte count but gibberish characters).
I will also note, that I had to update poppler to 0.14 to get it to correctly extract text from the test-871.pdf, the previous version would only extract the correct text from text-870.pdf.
Attached will be the pdf generated using the same original postscript file but run using ghostscript 8.70 vs 8.71.
