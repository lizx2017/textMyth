Summary:
Incomplete widths array for CID-fonts
Description:
In my day job I've migrated a project to PDFBox 2.0.0 and found an issue with CID-fonts. The created width array is incomplete in some non deterministic constellations, so that the default width is used for the missing CIDs. In my case spaces had a doubled width which lead to a false rendering.
Furthermore the CIDs aren't sorted so that the resulting width array might not be optimal
