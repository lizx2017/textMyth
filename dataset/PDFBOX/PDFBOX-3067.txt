Summary:
Text strings being returned as single characters, regression from version 1.8
Description:
PrintTextLocations writestring() is returning individual characters on this file, rather than a complete string. Was returning strings with '-200,000' in version 1.8
Also note that textposition.getWidthOfSpace() is getting a negative value (-4.464) for each character. Don't know if that is symptom or a cause.
