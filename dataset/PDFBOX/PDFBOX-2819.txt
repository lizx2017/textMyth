Summary:
invalid ICC Profile when reading from a byte array
Description:
6-1-12-t02-fail-a.pdf has 4 extra fails, that are related to an "invalid" ICC profile. "Invalid" meaning that ICC_Profile.getInstance() fails. Funny thing is that it works when reading from a stream. The following code shows this:
        FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(new File("veraPDF test suite 6-1-12-t02-fail-a.icc"));
        ICC_Profile instance = ICC_Profile.getInstance(fis);
        fis.close();
        File iccFile;
        FileInputStream fis2 = new FileInputStream(iccFile = new File("veraPDF test suite 6-1-12-t02-fail-a.icc"));
        byte[] iccBuf = new byte[(int) iccFile.length()];
        fis2.read(iccBuf);
        ICC_Profile instance2 = ICC_Profile.getInstance(iccBuf); // exception
        fis2.close();
That is a java bug
So I'll have to replace the calls in preflight accordingly. It doesn't apply to the main pdfbox project.
