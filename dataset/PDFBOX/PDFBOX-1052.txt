Summary:
XMPMetadata.getSchemas () delivery incorrect result if multiple namespaces are present
Description:
If an RDF document only has a single rdf:description element covering multiple namespaces, the getSchemas () method delivers only the first namespace.
It can easily be fixed by changing line 613 to:
for (int j = 0; j < attributes.getLength(); j++)
Please see the attached file for an example.
