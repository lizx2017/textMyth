Summary:
ClassCastException in PDAppearanceDictionary
Description:
org.apache.pdfbox.pdmodel.interactive.annotation.PDAppearanceDictionary: In both getRolloverAppearance() and getDownAppearance() the COSDictionary ap is added to itself, so causing a ClassCastException in the following while loop when it is casted to COSStream. I'll post a patch for this based on the getNormalAppearance() method.
