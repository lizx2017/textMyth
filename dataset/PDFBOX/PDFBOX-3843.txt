Summary:
Rect of Annotation contains indirect elements + Patch
Description:
During processing of attached PDF file (081204_gcada.pdf) I've found out that method PDAnnotation.getRectangle() is not able to get elements from Rect of annotation if these elements are indirect cos objects ([10 0 R 11 0 R 12 0 R 13 0 R]) -> returns null.
It works only if elements are direct cos objects.
Affected annotation is present on page with reference number 266 0 R (page 25).
Also I've attached a patch which solves this problems.
