Summary:
Checkbox with multiple widgets doesn't reflect check() state.
Description:
If a checkbox has multiple annotations (i.e. the same checkbox field occurs multiple times within the form) the appearance state for the annotation widgets is not correctly set.
This has been reported on the users mailing list:
Hi,
I have a simple document with two PDCheckbox fields, and one of those fields has two AnnotationWidgets. I am able to successfully call check() on the first field and see the result in the output document, but calling check() on the field with multiple AnnotationWidgets has no effect.
My understanding of duplicated fields is that only a single PDField exists but that an AnnotationWidget kid will exist for each instance of the field in the document, so setting the PDField parent once should affect all of the children. Am I misunderstanding how this should work?
Attached is the document I am testing as well as a small Java class that reproduces the issue by calling check() on everything in getFields(). I have tried this with PDFBox 1.8.9, 1.8.10, and the 09/03 Snapshot of 2.0.0. I am viewing the document with Adobe Acrobat Reader DC Version 2015.008.20082.
Any insight would be appreciated.
Thanks,
Bart.
