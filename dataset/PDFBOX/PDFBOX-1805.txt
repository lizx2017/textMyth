Summary:
PDFTextStripper, add word segment even if the last word is a space
Description:
I found that, in some PDFs, not injecting a WordSpacing in a line that is greater than expected for a space in the "line" normalization, causes text "fields" that should be separated (as they are not really part of the paragraph) to be improperly added to the line of text.
In the attached pdf, i have found that looking at the first line of the first violation of code, that the "Corrected By" date is incorrectly added to the same line of Description of Violation. This is due to the fact that the first line of "Description of Violation" ends with a space. This is due to word wrapping of the paragraph when it was generated and i believe that if the next letter in the line is greater than an expected space, regardless if the last line ends in a space, it should be considered a second segment.
I suggest removing the following change in PDFTextStripper file (i commented out the last two requirements from the if statement):
                   //Test if our TextPosition starts after a new word would be expected to start.
                    if (expectedStartOfNextWordX != EXPECTEDSTARTOFNEXTWORDX_RESET_VALUE
                            && expectedStartOfNextWordX < positionX) /* &&
                            //only bother adding a space if the last character was not a space
                            lastPosition.getTextPosition().getCharacter() != null &&
                            !lastPosition.getTextPosition().getCharacter().endsWith( " " ) ) */
                    {
                        line.add(WordSeparator.getSeparator());
                    }
