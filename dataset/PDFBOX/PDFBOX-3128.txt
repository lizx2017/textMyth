Summary:
Latest Apache Tika can't be used together with PDFBox 2.0
Description:
I'm using both Tika and PDFBox in my project and I have upgraded PDFBox to 2.0. I realized after that Tika is using some classes from PDFBox and some of these classes are removed from PDFBox 2.0 such as CryptographyException.
