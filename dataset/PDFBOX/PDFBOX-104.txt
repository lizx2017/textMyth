Hi,
I've tried to extract text from this URL:
http://www.ischool.washington.edu/mcdonald/papers/Lutters.AMCIS00.pdf
However, it throws java.lang.NullPointerException on me
although the PDF file does exist on that URL.
Here's the code where I invoke the PDFTextStripper:
String docURL =
"http://www.ischool.washington.edu/mcdonald/papers/Lutters.AMCIS00.pdf";
try{
PDFTextStripper stripper = new PDFTextStripper();
PDDocument pdfDoc =
PDDocument.load(getInputStreamFromURL(docURL));
String strippedText = stripper.getText(pdfDoc);
pdfDoc.close();
return stippedText;
}
catch(IOException e){
e.printStackTrace();
}
Here's getInputStreamFromURL method used in the above code:
public InputStream getInputStreamFromURL(String url){
try
{ URL myURL = new URL(url); URLConnection con = myURL.openConnection(); con.setRequestProperty("User-Agent",""); return con.getInputStream(); }
catch(MalformedURLException e)
{ e.printStackTrace(); }
catch(IOException ie)
{ ie.printStackTrace(); }
return null;
}
Please advise, Thanks

I am chasing a similar problem which might be related.
What I found (using PDFDebugger.java) was that the PDF
has an invalid PageTree: the root node and 5 of the 6
Page objects are valid, but the 6th is a Stream, and
not a Dictionary(Page). The offending code is:
private static COSArray
org.pdfbox.pdmodel.PDPageNode.getAllKids(
List result, COSDictionary page, boolean recurse
);
which needs to check that kids is non-null before
using it.
