Summary:
Invalid page rendering while printing a PDF with an image inside.
Description:
As soon as an image is included inside a page, all pages after that page are rendered only within the boundary of this image !?!?!
Steps to reproduce:
create a pdf with 2 pages
add an image on the first page (50px,50px) and centered on that page
add a text on the second page and centered on that page
print the pdf page throught org.apache.pdfbox.PrintPDF
Attached, you will find a sample pdf to reproduce that bug.
One more thing... if we use org.apache.pdfbox.PDFToImage instead, all pages are correctly rendered. That's kinda weird !
