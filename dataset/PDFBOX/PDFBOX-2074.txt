Summary:
4-bytes CMap entry causes exception
Description:
I have PDF that has CMap entry consisting of 4 bytes. It is just one entry with that size, other entries have 2-bytes.
Adobe reader has no problems with that, PDFBox throws Exception.
I think this Exception should not be thrown. It should be skipped or truncated tu 2 bytes and write warning to log.
