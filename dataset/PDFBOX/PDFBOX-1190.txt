Summary:
Attempting to render to BMP, WBMP or GIF causes IllegalStateException
Description:
Attempting to render PDF to either BMP, WBMP or GIF causes IllegalStateException while rendering to JPG, JPEG or PNG works. All of these image formats are reported as being present and available via call: ImageIO.getWriterFormatNames()
The issue seems to be with this code in PDFImageWriter
if( writerParams.canWriteCompressed() )
{ writerParams.setCompressionMode(ImageWriteParam.MODE_EXPLICIT); writerParams.setCompressionQuality(1.0f); // <== Exception here }
where a call to setCompressionType should precede setCompressionQuality for the failing image types listed above.
[looks like JUnit test cases only tests PNG ....]
Start of stack trace is this:
java.lang.IllegalStateException: No compression type set!
at javax.imageio.ImageWriteParam.setCompressionQuality(ImageWriteParam.java:1230)
at org.apache.pdfbox.util.PDFImageWriter.writeImage(PDFImageWriter.java:151)
