Summary:
Wrong colors with test file
Description:
The colors of the attached PDF are wrong when rendered with pdfbox 1.6.
As a sitenote, on a Windows 2000 system I do not have access to regularly, the text was completely messed up, too. I could not reproduce this on Windows Vista, though.
For completeness's sake, this is the code used to render the image:
PDDocument doc=PDDocument.load(file);
try
{ @SuppressWarnings("unchecked") List<PDPage> pages=doc.getDocumentCatalog().getAllPages(); return pages.get(0).convertToImage(); }
finally
{ doc.close(); }
