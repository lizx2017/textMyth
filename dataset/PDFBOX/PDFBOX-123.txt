Hi,
I use FontBox-0.1.0-dev.jar and PDFBox-0.7.3-dev.jar
from version PDFBox-0.7.3-dev-20060126.
My tested pdf file is test.pdf and the text extracted
text file is testPdf.txt as in uploaded test.zip file.
It extracted successfully,but there are many space
made between each chinese character.
Please check ! thanks
Regards
NanFei
