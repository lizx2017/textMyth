Summary:
Potential resource leak in TTFParser's use of RAFDataStream
Description:
TTFParser offers a method that parses a file. It looks like the RandomAccessFile is never closed if there is an exception â€“ I initially discovered this via running Tika batch on Common Crawl data, and code review confirms this. There should probably be a try/finally->close RAFDataStream in the parse#File method.
