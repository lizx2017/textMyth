Summary:
PDFToImage: Text missing or background box stacks over
Description:
When I try to convert this pdf to image, with the PDFToImage example app, then the result image is incorrect.
Some text blocks are missing (or maybe the background color box is stack over the text).
To reproduce:
`java -jar pdfbox-app-3.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar PDFToImage /tmp/doc_mock.pdf`
Thanks
