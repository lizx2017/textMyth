Signature byte range is Invalid
Description:
On person send me a unsigned PDF document. He wanted to sign it. When I try to sign it (using pad box), I have some problem.
After signing adobe reader tells me "The signature byre range is invalid".
I will attach original and signed document.
I think, it is PDF box parser error. another signature libraries sign document very well. I'm searching the problem at the moment, in order to fix it.
