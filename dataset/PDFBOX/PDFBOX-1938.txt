Summary:
PDF2Image gives garbled text in image
Description:
When the attached PDF file is written to an image, the text shown in the image is garbled. The table and images are fine, it just looks as though the text has the wrong encoding.
The problem is easily produced using the PDFBox example org.apache.pdfbox.PDF2Image with the following command line options:-
-imageType jpg -outputPrefix BadText BadText.pdf
I hope to attach the test/culprit document when this JIRA is created.
BTW: The same file caused a JVM crash at PDFBox 1.8.0, so thanks for getting me this far
