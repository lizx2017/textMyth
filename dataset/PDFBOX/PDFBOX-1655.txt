Summary:
Wasted work (or incorrect behavior) in PDCIDFontType2Font.readCIDToGIDMapping
Description:
The problem appears in version 1.8.2 and in revision 1497941. I
attached a two-line patch (patch.diff) that fixes it.
In method "PDCIDFontType2Font.readCIDToGIDMapping", the loop:
"for(int offset = 0;offset < numberOfInts;offset++)"
keeps overriding "cid2gid[index]" with "getCodeFromArray(mapAsBytes,
offset, 2)", where "index" does not change in the loop ("index" is
always "0"). Therefore, only the last written value is visible out of
the loop and all the previous writes and iterations are not necessary.
The patch iterates from the end of the loop and breaks the first time
when "cid2gid[index]" is set. The code can be further simplified, but
I leave it like this to make the patch easy to follow.
My patch preserves the original code behavior, but note that the
original code (not the patch) may be incorrect to start with: maybe
the code is not supposed to keep overriding "cid2gid[index]" (with
"index" never changing in the loop, with value "0" all the time), but
rather to also change "index". Maybe the code was supposed to be
something like "cid2gid[index++]".
