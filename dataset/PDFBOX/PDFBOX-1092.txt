Summary:
Image Rendering Regression
Description:
Running ant testimage , I find several tests failing.
ARCHIVERGB – the version of the PNG file in trunk\pdfbox\src\test\resources\input\rendering is far closer to the AI than is the one that is output. I believe the problem has to do with the Stencil Mask.
HOTRODCMYK – same as ARCHIVERGB
test-landscape2 – not coming out in Landscape format any more
A few others are reported as "not identical" but they are visually identical – false-positives IMO. The above 3, however, have regressed since those image snapshots were taken ... version 1.2 IIRC.
