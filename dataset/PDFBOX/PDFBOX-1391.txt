Summary:
Document with "embedded subset" fonts is displayed incorrect
Description:
Hi. I am trying use PDFReader to display a PDF file produced with OpenOffice.org, but the output contains lots of grabbled characters.
I thought the problem was that the font was not embedded (Tahoma in this case), but after inspecting the file, Tahoma is listed as "embedded subset". However, lots of "Changing font on <> from <Tahoma> to the default font" messages are logged.
The file is correctly displayed by other readers, could you please help me to determine what is wrong?
Thanks in advance.
