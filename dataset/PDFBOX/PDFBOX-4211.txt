Summary:
Some text is missing in JBIG2 images
Description:
This PDF has problems.
See pages "iii" (2), "ix" (6), "x" (7) etc. These pages have most of their text missing or in wrong position when rendered in PDFDebugger. Each page is a JBIG2 image that uses Huffman encoding. You may need to use for example -Xmx1000M to avoid OutOfMemoryError because the JBIG2 images are very large.
Apply my patch to file EncodedTable.java in package org.apache.pdfbox.jbig2.decoder.huffman. I have fixed one line of code that does not follow the JBIG2 standard.
The JBIG2 standard is freely available here
