Problem With Malformed xref
Description:
Some files generated with unknown software. Generated malformed xref table, this instead of being well-formed with the correct EOL is in one line.
Other readers correctly read the file, and sign it.
PDFBox instead give Exception for malformed xref.
I tried created a patch that allows you to read the above mentioned file. Because the original file is private I proceeded to recreate one the patch works with both.
