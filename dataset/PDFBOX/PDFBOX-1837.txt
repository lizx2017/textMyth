Summary:
PDDocument.save(String) doesn't correctly save digital signatures
Description:
After digitally signing a PDF, if I save it with PDDocument.save(String), Adobe Reader reports the signature as invalid. The same doesn't happen if the PDF is saved with PDDocument.saveIncremental(FileInputStream, OutputStream).
