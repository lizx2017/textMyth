How to concat pdf with fields ?
2006-01-23 17:47
Hi,
I use pdfBox version 0.7.2
I have two pdf with fields that already filled
(pdf only one page)
I want to concat them, so I use the method
AppendDoc() from the package
org.pdfbox.examples.persistence.AppendDoc
The first page it's good and the seconde the fields
are empty.
I don't why ?

sounds like a bug, please create a bug report and
attach/upload the pdf documents that you are using.
ftp.pdfbox.org
