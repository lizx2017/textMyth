Extracted text does not have spaces
Description:
Extracted text does not have spaces between some words.
Use to test please a string on line 74a... inside of attached test.pdf.
It will be extracted as: "74a Amount of line73youwant refunded toyou . If Form8888 isattached , checkhere"
The result is not seems to be good, the words are "glued".
I tried to use a class PDF Text Stripper but the result still remain the same.
For us it is a big problem. Can it be resolved, please?
With respect,
Vitalie
