Summary:
Type0 CFF Font with identity encoding rendered incorrectly
Description:
The attached pdf files were created in iText. Both print two lines containing the text "Hello World!". The second line is printed using a Type0 CFF font with encoding Identity-H. One of the documents uses a western languages font (font0.pdf). The other one (font0-arabic.pdf) uses an Arabic font, but this font contains latin letters, too. Expected rendering can be seen in Acrobat, the wrong rendering from PDFBox created via PDFToImage is attached.
I have experimented with the problem and tried to fix it, proposed changes are attached in Type0FontEncoding.patch. However, I came to the result just by experimenting, without really reading the PDF specification. Also, I am getting lost in the many mappings internally used in PDFBox, so an expert view is for sure required.
Note: I have seen several issues where font encoding is already discussed, but I was not able to decide whether this exact problem is already described in one of them. Sorry, if this is a duplicate.
Note: Even after fixing the encoding problem, the font size of the second line in the "Arabic" example is wrong for some reason. This is probably a different issue and I did not try to analyze it yet.
