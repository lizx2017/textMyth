Hi,
I created an PDF from itext that has an solo Image in it. When I parsed the
pdf using PDFBOX, it returns an object of COSDictionaryMap when I do
this:
PDDocument document = PDDocument.load(pdfDocStream);
List pages = document.getDocumentCatalog().getAllPages();
PDPage pdfPage = (PDPage)pages.iterator().next();
Map images = pdfPage.getResources().getImages();
The images instance has size() of 1, but the content is empty!
Any idea?
