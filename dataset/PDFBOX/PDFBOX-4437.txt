Summary:
Import XFDF stamp annotation loses appearance
Description:
When loading an XFDF which has a stamp annotation which contains an appearance element after added to the PDF in place of the annotation is an box with an X.
Reviewing the FDFAnnotationStamp class, it skips all internal elements.  Is there any development being done to enhance this?
I've attached "xfdf stamp annotation to PDF.zip" which has an example, if you open the stamp_annot.xfdf it will show on the PDF.  While using PDFBox API the only piece missing is the appearance of the stamp.
