Summary:
Oracle JVM crashes because of embedded fonts.
Description:
Oracle's closed-source font rendering chokes on some fonts embedded in PDFs because their cmap data is either missing or invalid.
Using OpenJDK, no crashes were observed.
The JVM crashes right after attempting to draw a glyph vector using codepoints, which is called from within PDSimpleFont#drawString.
Versions of pdfbox prior to 1.7.0 did not crash.
The crashes look like this:
JRE 6:
JRE version: 6.0_45-b06
Java VM: Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (20.45-b01 mixed mode linux-amd64 compressed oops)
Problematic frame:
C [libfontmanager.so+0x242c8] imaginary long double+0xd8
JRE 7:
JRE version: 7.0_21-b11
Java VM: Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (23.21-b01 mixed mode linux-amd64 compressed oops)
Problematic frame:
C [libt2k.so+0x2e6b1] Compute_cmapClass_GlyphIndex+0x1
Since older versions of pdfbox did not crash, I tracked the problem down to a call to java.awt.Font#canDisplayUpTo(String) that has been moved in 1.7.0 from the top of PDSimpleFont#drawString down to a branch. Moving the call back up prevented the crash.
It looks like a call to java.awt.Font#canDisplay(int) initializes some internal data structures of Oracle's fontmanager, preventing the JVM crash.
As I have observed this crash only for fonts that have been processed through PDType0Font, I have added a fix there, which should save us some cycles and, more importantly, should not create new problems.
Oracle bug reports have been filed for both JRE 6 and 7, including a "minimal" test case:
Oracle JRE 6: http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=9002077
Oracle JRE 7: http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=9002078
There have been a few other bug reports mentioning a similar crash on other platforms, older JRE versions, e.g.: PDFBOX-1426, PDFBOX-1336.
The patch provided here might fix these bugs, too.
