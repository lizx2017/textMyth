Summary:
PDF file containing PDCIDFontType0 (PDType1CFont) does not render correctly to image
Description:
Some of the PDF files that contain CID fonts (which are parsed by class PDType1CFont) do not produce correct images.
This is, I think, because the created AWT font by PDType1CFont.getawtFont method is not right.
The AWT font do not return correct glyphs for either of the unicode characters or code points.
I will attach a sample PDF to demonstrate the case.
