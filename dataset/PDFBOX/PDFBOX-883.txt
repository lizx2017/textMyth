Summary:
Special characters are not correctly handled anymore when printing or exporting to image
Description:
I've just upgraded PDFBox from 1.2.1 to 1.3.1 and special characters (like 'é', '°', 'à', ...) are not correctly handled anymore when printing or exporting to image. These characters are remplaced by 'Ø' or blank spaces. Everything was working flawlessly with PDFBox 1.2.1.
