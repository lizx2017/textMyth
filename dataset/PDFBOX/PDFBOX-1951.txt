Summary:
Merging documents causes image colors to change when not running locally.
Description:
There are 2 types of PDF documents in one directory. One type is a simple letter that is editable that had blanks filled in with information that was pulled from a database. The other type is an address label that was printed using Simple Certified Mail's method to take an address and create a label. The label is a black and white image with some text and a barcode. When merging the two types of documents together with a method call from across the network, the letter is fine, but the label is purple where it should be white and yellow where it should be black. When calling the method from the jar file located within the project itself, everything merges in black and white just fine.
