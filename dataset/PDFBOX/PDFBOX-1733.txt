Summary:
Rectangles have one rounded edge in rendered image only
Description:
The file test-landscape2.pdf of the pdfbox tests has two rectangles, but when rendering each one has a rounded edge at the top left. There is no such edge in the acrobat viewer.
A debug shows that the cap property of the stroke property of the java graphics object is set to CAP_ROUND which produces this effect.
In the pdf, there is this line:
6 w 8 M 1 J
The "1 J" means "round cap"

So I'm not even sure if this is a bug in pdfbox or a bug in the acrobat viewer. Does anyone here use a different viewer?
