Summary:
Erroneous values for TextPosition get{X,Y}[DirAdj]
Description:
Erroneous text positions for some of the characters in the attached PDF. Interestingly, it seems to happen with the characters belonging to the table.
Attachments: the offending PDF and the output of PrintTextLocations (notice X values much larger than the width of the cropbox and negative Y values)
Additionally, Poppler's pdftohtml seems to generate correct values for the same input.
