Summary:
Problem in TextPosition's hashCode
Description:
Just another side effect related to TextPosition's hashCode
I am using the hashCode because I want to know the color of each letter. To do this, during the processTextPosition, I save the current graphic state in a map, using the current text position as key. Then, on writeString, I iterate all the text positions and I get the color for each of them though this map.
Of course would be easier if this information could be saved in the text position. But this is just a desired feature.
I am discovering that from processTextPosition to writeString sometimes happens that the same textPosition has just a different unicode. In processTextPosition is just a "x" (char 120), but then on writeString the same textPosition the unicode is the x, followed by 'Ì„' (char 772). Everything about the textPosition remains the same: same coordinates, same System.identityHashCode; the only thing that changes is the unicode, which causes the computation of a different hashCode.
That is giving problem. As workaround I am using now System.identityHashCode instead of the current TextPosition's implementation
