Summary:
PDF consisting on one page with 5 MB renders until the end of time using renderImageWithDPI
Description:
I am using PDFBOX 2.0.8 on a Java VM 1.8.0_151
The attached and valid pdf should be rendered by calling
BufferedImage bim = pdfRenderer.renderImageWithDPI(i, 50);
But the rendering never ends - the only thing I see is this line repeating very often in the console:
[Finalizer] DEBUG org.apache.pdfbox.io.ScratchFileBuffer - ScratchFileBuffer not closed!
Here is the code that is used to open the document and then start the rendering:
PDDocument document = PDDocument.load(file, MemoryUsageSetting.setupTempFileOnly());
try  {
   PDFRenderer pdfRenderer = new PDFRenderer(document);
   int numberOfPages = document.getPages().getCount();
   for (int i = 0; i < numberOfPages; i++) {
      BufferedImage bim = pdfRenderer.renderImageWithDPI(i, 50);
[...]
The line
BufferedImage bim = pdfRenderer.renderImageWithDPI(i, 50);
is never passed. I ran a test and have wait for 30 minutes to let it pass, but nothing happens.
Please advise what to do and how to solve the issue.
