Summary:
PDFToImage don't render text in iText generated PDF
Description:
When try to PDFToImage a pdf with text added with the iText library, the result image don't contain the text.
I debugged a little the pdfbox, and found that the text is extracted well in the class org/apache/pdfbox/pdmodel/font/PDType1Font.java the String is drawed in the graphics as should be ( i think so )
If i write the BufferedImage in PDPage convertToImage() the image don't contains anything. i belive the issue is that the graphics objects where the PDType1Font1 draws the string is not the "same", or something related.
a PDF to test can be found at http://itext.ugent.be/library/com/lowagie/examples/general/HelloWorldPdf.pdf
Thanks.
