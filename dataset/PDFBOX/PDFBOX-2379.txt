Summary:
glyphlist_ext is not OSGI compatible
Description:
The system property "glyphlist_ext" used in GlyphList is not OSGI compatible (see PDFBOX-2358) as it loads resources from an external module. The mechanism is unsafe and should be replaced with a simple static method, e.g. GlyphList.addGlyphs(Properties).
