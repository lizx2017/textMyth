Summary:
PDFStreamEngine.processEncodedText incorrectly handling UTF-16 text with BOM FEFF
Description:
When having a text print operation like
<FEFF21222193219103B103A003A6> Tj
than the PDFStreamEngine.processEncodedText does not handle this correctly.
Am I correct that if a BOM was determined, the codelength should be set to 2 (and not be changed)? Or should alternatively simply the BOM be skipped?
