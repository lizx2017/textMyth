Summary:
Improper text produced depending on font for sample_fonts_solidconverter.pdf
Description:
Looking at another issue and running the regression test, I found that the sample_fonts_solidconverter.pdf file in the test directory has some issues producing the proper
text for two of the 9 fonts used for this line. The other fonts worked fine.
The Produced Text:
V e r d a n a : T o t o j e p o k u s n ý t e x t s
ea t i n o u a ~Y
ý á í é
S a n s s e r i f : T o t o j e p o k u s n ý t e x t s
ea t i n o u a
~Y ý á í é
should be
Verdana: Toto je pokusný text s češtinou - ěščřžýáíé
Sans serif: Toto je pokusný text s češtinou - ěščřžýáíé
I found this using the current trunk and the files in question are located in the ..\source\trunk\test\input directory.
