Summary:
ExternalFonts uses classloader of class in font-box
Description:
ExternalFonts loads some default fonts via the org.apache.fontbox.util.ResourceLoader. That resourceloader uses it's own classloader (ResourceLoader.class.getClassLoader()) for loading the given resource.
The problem is that the resource is in the PDFBox project and the ResourceLoader in the FontBox. In an OSGI environment this is a problem.
