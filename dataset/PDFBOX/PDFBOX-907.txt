Summary:
Encrypted Key not correctly calculated when the meta data is not encrypted
Description:
Since rev 4, meta data can be unencrypted while the data is encrypted. If the metadata is not encrypted 0xFFFFFFFF should be added to the hash:
"Security handlers of revision 4 or greater) If document metadata is not being encrypted, pass 4 bytes with
the value 0xFFFFFFFF to the MD5 hash function."
(see see 7.6.3.3 Algorithm 2 Step f of PDF 32000-1:2008)
Whether or not the metadata is encrypted is store in the encryption dictionary. The default value is to encrypt the meta data.
I will attach a patch to detect whether the meta data is encrypted, and if not 0xFFFFFFFF will be added.
The document that I have tested with can be downloaded from http://www.mbtareview.com/MBTA_Review_2009.pdf
