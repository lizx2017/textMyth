Summary:
java.awt.geom.IllegalPathStateException: missing initial moveto in path definition
Description:
I get this with the attached file:
java.awt.geom.IllegalPathStateException: missing initial moveto in path definition
 at java.awt.geom.Path2D$Float.needRoom(Path2D.java:280)
 at java.awt.geom.Path2D$Float.needRoom(Path2D.java:280)
 at java.awt.geom.Path2D.closePath(Path2D.java:1769)
I missed that one when I fixed PDFBOX-2158. The fix will be to do nothing and put out a warning if there's no current point.
