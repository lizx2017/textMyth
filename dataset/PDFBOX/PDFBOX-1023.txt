Summary:
Getting image with black background when converting from PDF to Image!!
Description:
Everytime I try to conver a PDF file with a graphic on it, to Image (PNG) I get a black background beneath the graphic, where the background is white originally, here's my code:
PDDocument document = PDDocument.load(new File("C:\\export_settings
testReport.pdf"));
List<PDPage> pages = document.getDocumentCatalog().getAllPages();
for (int i = 0; i < pages.size(); i++)
{ PDPage singlePage = pages.get(i); BufferedImage buffImage = singlePage.convertToImage(); ImageIO.write(buffImage, "PNG", new File("C:\\export_settings\\page" + i + ".png")); }
The image quality is good, except for this, I tried with two different methos but I got the same result, please help me, thanks!
