Summary:
PDF conversion to image crashes the JVM
Description:
The file http://tie.open.ac.uk/256.pdf crashes the JVM during conversion to jpeg with the following message :
Assertion failed: (fnum >= 0 && fnum < t->numSubrs), function BuildSubrs, file ../../../src/share/native/sun/font/t2k/t1.c, line 3098.
Java Result: 134
The error happens in the method convertToImage():
PDPage page = (PDPage) pages.get(startPage);
PDPage page = (PDPage) pages.get(0);
try
{ image = page.convertToImage(); }
catch (IOException ex)
{ Logger.getLogger(PdfIText.class.getName()).log(Level.SEVERE, null, ex); }
The problem occurs not for all files, but is critical as it stops my webserver (Tomcat) that needs to be then restarted.
