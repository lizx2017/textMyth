Summary:
TTF encoding issues
Description:
I've noticed some issues when trying to encode text using embedded TTF fonts (e.g. filling forms). There's a special case where we use the font's built-in encoding via the cmap finding method described in the PDF spec. The problem is that in this special case, we treat the Encoding as null, which breaks some of the assumptions of the encode(...) method.
The first thing to do is to handle the case for TTF where encoding is null.
A second idea is to synthesise and Encoding for the TTF, so that a PDTrueType font has a Encoding just like any other font. That's a bit more tricky, but it would be conceptually much cleaner.
