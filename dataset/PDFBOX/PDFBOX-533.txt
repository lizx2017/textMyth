Summary:
PDFTextStripper.writeCharacters is called no where in the class
Description:
It seems writeCharacters method is not called anywhere in the PDFTextStripper class. This makes it impossible for handling character TextPosition as well as Line Separator because processLineSeparator method is no longer there and writeLineSeparator is called when actual writing happens.
