Summary:
Documentation: prominent example has out-of-date class name
Description:
Page http://pdfbox.apache.org/userguide/index.html includes a prominent graphic as part of the discussion of PDDocument. However this refers to org.pdfbox.pdmodel., which is the old home for this component. Other mentions of this on the page refer correctly to org.apache.pdfbox..
This is a bit confusing (but nothing major), but it's the first, and most prominent, version of the class name.
Fix: just regenerate the graphic
