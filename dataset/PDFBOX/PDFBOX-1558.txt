Summary:
Unused PDSignature class should be removed
Description:
In 1.8.0, the uses of class org.apache.pdfbox.pdmodel.interactive.form.PDSignature have been replace with ....form.PFSignatureField, but the old ...form.PDSignature class still exists.
This can be confusing when upgrading to PDFBox 1.8.0 – code that tests for the presence of PDSignature instances will compile, but fail to work correctly. Removing the old PDSignature will give upgraders a more helpful compilation error.
The old ...form.PDSignature class should be removed or the new ...form.PDSignatureField should be renamed to completely replace it.
