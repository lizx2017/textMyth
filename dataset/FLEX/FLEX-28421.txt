Summary:
Throw scrolls often don't animate with MXML item renderers
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create an MXML item renderer and use it in a Flex mobile project (see attached)
2. Run the application on an Android phone
3. Click on "play" to simulate a throw scroll
This is a sample mouse event sequence that causes this:
{type: "mouseMove", localX: 207, localY: 465, fakeTimeValue: 14275}
,
{type: "rollOver", localX: 207, localY: 465, fakeTimeValue: 14281}
,
{type: "mouseOver", localX: 207, localY: 465, fakeTimeValue: 14283}
,
{type: "mouseMove", localX: 207, localY: 465, fakeTimeValue: 14285}
,
{type: "mouseDown", localX: 207, localY: 465, fakeTimeValue: 14294}
,
{type: "mouseMove", localX: 221, localY: 416, fakeTimeValue: 14320}
,
{type: "mouseMove", localX: 354, localY: 86, fakeTimeValue: 14495}
,
{type: "mouseOut", localX: 354, localY: 86, fakeTimeValue: 14753}
,
{type: "mouseOver", localX: 354, localY: 86, fakeTimeValue: 14757}
,
{type: "mouseUp", localX: 354, localY: 86, fakeTimeValue: 14779}
,
{type: "mouseOut", localX: 354, localY: 86, fakeTimeValue: 14826}
,
{type: "mouseOver", localX: 354, localY: 86, fakeTimeValue: 14829}
];
Actual Results:
Many throws don't go anywhere
Expected Results:
Throws should animate to a scroll position. This worked fine in 4.5.1 with the AIR version that shipped with that release. Simply updating the AIR runtime to the latest builds seems to make this issue much more reproducible. I suspect the mouse events we get from the player have changed slightly between Wasabi and Anza.
