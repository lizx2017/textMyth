Summary:
When cell is editable, then just selecting the text using sequence of MouseEvents, the itemEditBegin doesn't fires.
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create the project with two files, attached .
2. Run the mxml file.
3. Select the "$0.00", in Amount Column using only Mouse, [don't click], and see in the textBox below, itemEditBegin doesn't fires.
Actual Results:
It doesn't fires, and hence itemEditEnd also doesn't fires, this messes up with any formatting logic, which is written on itemEditBegin. This should fire , irrespective of the type of Mouse Event.
Expected Results:
It should fire everytime, either user clicks, or selects the text.
Workaround (if any):
None...
Note : This works for DataGrid in Flex SDK 3.5 but ADG is broken under the same SDK 3.5.
