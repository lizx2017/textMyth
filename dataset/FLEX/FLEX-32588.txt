Summary:
Setting selectedCells does not select all cells in array unless first cell in cellection is visible
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Scroll grid so that first column/or row is not visible.
2. From code, set grid selectedCells property to select N number of cells where first cell in selection is not visible
Actual Results:
Usually this results in only the first cell in the selection being made.
Expected Results:
All cells in array should be selected regardless of visibility
Workaround (if any):
Scroll grid to include first row and column being selected
e.g. if first cell in selectedCells will be 11,5 then:
var cellsToBeSelected:Array = [
{rowIndex 5, columnIndex: 11}
,
{ rowIndex: 5, columnIndex: 12}
,
{rowIndex:6, columnIndex:11}
,
{rowIndex:6, columnIndex:12}
];
grid.scrollToIndex(cellsToBeSelected[0].rowIndex);
grid.horizontalScrollPosition = cellsToBeSelected[0].columnIndex;
grid.selectedCells = cellsToBeSelected;
