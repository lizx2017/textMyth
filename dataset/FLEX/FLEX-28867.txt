Summary:
When mouse over a component in a tooltip that also has tooltip, the tooltip in tooltip appears
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Copy the attached zip or fxp file.
2. Run the app NestedToolTip.mxml.
3. Mouse over the TextInput.
4. When the tooltip appears, mouse over the 3rd TextInput in the tooltip.
Actual Results: Tooltip of tooltip appears. And if you repeat, you can get as many nested tooltips as you want and it seems like the older parent tooltips don't disappear on its own.
Expected Results: In the spec, it said "We will not support tool tips in tool tips." and it probably shouldn't appear at all?
