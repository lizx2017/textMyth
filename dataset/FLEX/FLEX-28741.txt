Summary:
FTETextField.setTextFormat not working properly
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1.Run attached Application
Actual Results:
The text does not render properly. (see attached image).
Expected Results:
The text should render properly. (see attached image).
Workaround (if any):
I have fount 3 workarounds
1. set htmlText before calling setTextFormat()
2. set defaultTextFormat rather than calling setTextFormat()
3. call setTextFormat() after the htmlText has been set.
This was working in 4.1, but when we updated to 4.5.1 this defect showed up. While there are workarounds, we have code that relies on this working and none of these three options are optimal/would result in additional overhead.
