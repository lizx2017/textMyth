Summary:
Sorting with non-existing dataField and custom sortCompareFunction
Description:
I have written a CustomDataGridColumn which extends AdvancedDataGridColumn. It allows the usage of nested objects in the dataField (e.g. dataField="name.de_DE"). The custom column uses a labelFunction and sortCompareFunction to display the correct value. However, the sorting doesn't work.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Compile the provided test case and debug it.
2. Open some nodes in the left ADG and sort a column.
3. Open some nodes in the right (custom) ADG and sort a column.
Actual Results:
The values in the left grid are not sorted even though the column shows the sort arrow. The custom grid on the right side allows sorting.
Expected Results:
The sorting should always work when a custom sortCompareFunction is used regardless of the existance of the dataField.
Workaround (if any):
I had to extend the ADG in order to provide a new implementation of HierarchicalCollectionView (FixedHierarchicalCollectionView) in the constructor. Furthermore I had to override refresh() and copy some parts of internalRefresh() and sortCanBeApplied() into my new class. In sortCanBeApplied() I added a check for a compareFunction (line 82). After those changes the sorting works quite fine.
