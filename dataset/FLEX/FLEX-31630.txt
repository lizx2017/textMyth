Summary:
ASDoc: GridLines says origins drawn with originStroke instead of vertical/horizontalOriginStroke
Description:
In GridLine.as, the ASDoc for horizontalShowOrigin and verticalShowOrigin both say that if true, the origin line is drawn using the "originStroke" style. But there is no such style property, and the origin lines are actually drawn using the "horizontalOriginStroke" and "verticalOriginStroke" styles.
