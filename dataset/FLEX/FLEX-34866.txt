Summary:
Constructors need field intialization of scalar values
Description:
From the dev list;
>So what are all the scalar values in AS?
String, Int, Number, Uint, Boolean. IIRC, it is anything you don’t “new”.
[] is effectively “new Array”, {} is effectively “new Object”. And String
is in the list only because there is no in-place String modifiers. And
you can’t just watch out for “new” as there can be static generators.
private var foo:SomeInstance = SomeSingleton.SomeInstanceFactory;

IIRC, in Flex in AS2 (not AS3) the convention was to declare all
variables/properties on the prototype, and initialize scalars on the
prototype and write code to initialize instance values in the constructor.
But feel free to do something else if it is easier.
