Summary:
Pictures from Camera are slower coming into the app using SDK 28
Description:
Builds with sdk 28 using Flex 4.16.1 Air 28 and FP 28 with apple devices, pictures taken in the app come into the app much slower than they did with 4.15 Air 23 FP 23.  With SDK 23 pictures came into the app in less than 2 seconds on iPhone 6, with sdk 28 picture are taking over 6 seconds to come into the app.  With all apple devices, pictures are taking a good bit longer to come into the app using the new sdk 28 vs. using the older sdk 23.
I discovered important information on this issue.  The number of bytes that is being processed has increased greatly even through the height of the picture had not.  Using the same code and taking a picture of the same thing I go from 1,379,846 bytes (sdk 26) to 10,659,755 bytes (sdk 28). 
When the user clicks "use photo" the MediaEvent hits and inside it I create the loaderComplete event.
loader = new Loader();
loader.contentLoaderInfo.addEventListener(Event.COMPLETE, loaderCompleted);
loader.loadFilePromise(mediaPromise);
  When the loaderComplete hits I get the loaderInfo where I can see the number of bytes for the picture has greatly increased.
var loaderInfo:LoaderInfo = event.target as LoaderInfo;
loaderInfo.bytesLoaded or loaderInfo.bytesTotal
  I'm hoping that you can tell me what was changed from sdk 26 to sdk 28 to caused this.  That way I could hand edit sdk 28 to be like 26 in regards to this.
