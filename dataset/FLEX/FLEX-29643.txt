Summary:
We shouldn't use name for automationValue for images, and maybe any component
Description:
The name attribute is not consistent across sessions, and automationValue is used both for persistent IDs for virtual nodes, and for data verification in checkpoints (in get tabular data). Images should return their tooltip....and possibly we should not return name attribute for any component for automationValue...and possibly we should not return name attribute for any component in automationName.
