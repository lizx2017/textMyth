Summary:
[QNX] StageText: Programmatically setting focus on a StageText component sends the wrong softKeyboard event and subsequently stops other softKeyboard events from firing on QNX programmatically.
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Compile the attached project for QNX, install and run.
2. Observe, either in the label for the mxml example or the output for the .as example, that the first event fired is for softkeyboard deactivate.
3. Examine the code and verify that the two timer events should result in an activate followed by a deactivate.
Actual Results:
1. First event fired (for the softKeyboard activating) is "softKeyboardDeactivate".
2. The second timer event fires but there is no change in the softKeyboard.
Expected Results:
1. The first event fired is softKeyboardActivate, with corresponding softKeyboard activation.
2. The second timer event fires and we get a softKeyboardDeactivate, with corresponding softKeyboard deactivation.

Additional Info:
When looking at focus events for this same scenario you get two focusOut's when you should get a focusIn, and no focus events when you should get a focusOut.
