Summary:
Text anti Aliasing different on iOS5 (Beta7) than on iOS4.x
Description:
On iOS 5 beta 7, text rending is different than on previous iOS version. (This is non editable text and is not necessarily StageText) We found this while running a semi automated test run on Flex.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run an application with text in it on iOS 4.x and take a screen shot.
2. Run the same app running on IOS 5 and take a screen shot.
3. Display the screen shots side by side and look at the diffs.
Actual Results:
In the attached sample, the right edge of the second "t" in the word "button" is fuzzy in the new image, and clear in the expected one.( The visual diff is at the top of this image.) Or the U in the second attached sample displays different anti aliasing.
It appear that apple may have changed aliasing or anti-aliasing on iOS5 and we need to make the necessary adjustments. (Just a guess)
Expected Results:
Equivalent text rendering
