Summary:
SparkDropDownListBaseAutomationImpl: incorrect getAutomationChildAt implementation
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a Spark DrownDownList with lots of items so that it has a vertical scrollbar.
2. Open the dropdown programmatically.
3. Call SparkDropDownListBaseAutomationImpl/getAutomationChildAt with index argument equal to numAutomationChildren-1
4. The following error will be generated: "Error #1010: A term is undefined and has no properties."
5. The getAutomationChildAt also traces a "We should not have this method" which sounds like the function is not supposed to be called. However it is a public documented function of Flex automation framework and I expect it to work properly (like it always did in past for all other components).
Actual Results:
An error is thrown.
Expected Results:
Correct child to be returned.
Workaround (if any):
None.
