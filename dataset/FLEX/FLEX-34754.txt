Summary:
Spark VideoPlayer does not display video (only audio) since Flex SDK 4.11
Description:
The Spark VideoPlayer/VideoDisplay components do not display video. Audio streams fine, but where the video should be it's black/blank. The video duration is populated and the seek bar moves and can be controlled but when seeking to another position, the video still does not display but the audio can be heard.
Switching to Flex SDK 4.10 or older immediately resolves the problem. This bug can be replicated using Flex SDK 4.11, 4.12, 4.12.1, 4.13 and 4.14. All SDKs were downloaded using the installer and Flash Player 16 and AIR 16 was selected for each SDK.
The Flex project does not have any additional customisations.
The video playback works as expected when using Flex SDK 4.10, 4.9.1, 4.9.0, 4.8.0 and 4.6.0.
Could the OSMF update in Flex SDK 4.11 be the cause?
