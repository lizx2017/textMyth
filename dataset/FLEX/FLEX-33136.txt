Summary:
ASDoc no longer generates valid output when executed inside Flexmojos
Description:
I am currently working on making Flexmojos compatible with Apache Flex 4.8.0.1358354
Allmost all tests are running smoothly, except the ones regarding ASDoc. In all of these casses the output directory for ASDoc only contains one directory "tempdita" and this contains one file "packages.dita" but nothing else. I'll attach the configuration passed to the ASDoc call to this issue.
