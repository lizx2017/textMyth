Summary:
Spark Datagrid : Record Select and Column Sort issue
Description:
I have a Flex Mobile app with a Spark Datagrid. When the data-grid is populated, the app :
1) Allows you to 'only' select +/- half of the records on the data-grid, the rest are not select-able.
2) If you click on the column headers, only the first 2 columns when selected performs a sort.
I reverted to SDK 4.9.1 with Air 3.4 and I can select 'all' recordsin the data-grid + click on any header and the grid will sort.
