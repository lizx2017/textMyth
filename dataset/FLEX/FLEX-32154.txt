Summary:
OLAP cube doesn't handle dimension's hierarchies with values linked to non-leaf level
Description:
It seems that, working on hierarchies of dimension, all value must always be attached to the lowest level of the hierarchy.
Let's say that my dimension is the structure of a company, with departments and units - I create the dimension like this:
<mx:OLAPDimension name="CompanyStructureDimension">
<mx:OLAPAttribute name="Department" dataField="dept"/>
<mx:OLAPAttribute name="Unit" dataField="unit"/>
<mx:OLAPHierarchy name="CompanyStructureHierarchy" hasAll="true">
<mx:OLAPLevel attributeName="Department"/>
<mx:OLAPLevel attributeName="Unit"/>
</mx:OLAPHierarchy>
</mx:OLAPDimension>
Now, what if want to load some values directly to a department, and not to one of its units? If i try to leave blank, null, or
omit completely the attribute for the unit on source flat data, all the points of the cube for the other units of this
department will be NaN.
I attached a simple application that show the issue.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run the attached application.
2. Comment out the last element of the flatData collection and run it again.
Actual Results:
Many points of the cube will become NaN with the line included.
Expected Results:
In the attached application it should just ignore that row of data (but it should take it into account when
querying the cube at the department level).
Workaround (if any):
Maybe, use a fake unit to hold values that don't belong to any unit? (never tried this scenario)
