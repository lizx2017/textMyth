Summary:
"visible" property for FlexList item not working as expected
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Say there is a FlexList object called 'Available Trunks' and '0/1/0 (BRI)'
is one of the items in the list. Please refer to the attached screen-shot
2.Using the following QTP code, I'm not able to select the '0/1/0 (BRI)' item in the list
If Window("CCP").FlexApplication("Main").FlexTitleWindow("Create Incoming Dial Plan").FlexList("Available Trunks").FlexListLabel("automationvalue:=0/1/0 (BRI)", "visible:=True").Exist(5) Then
Window("CCP").FlexApplication("Main").FlexTitleWindow("Create Incoming Dial Plan").FlexList("Available Trunks").Select "0/1/0 (BRI)"
End If
The If condition returns 'False'. Same piece of code works for a FlexComboBox.
NOTE: The List item will be a dynamic object. So there is no option but to use programmatic description.
Actual Results: FlexListLabel with programmatic description returns False for the Exist method
Expected Results: Exist should return true since the list item exists and visible
