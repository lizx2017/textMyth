Summary:
Update Guava dependency in compiler
Description:
Currently, Falcon is dependent on Guava r08. FalconJx (itself dependent on Falcon) uses the Google Closure Compiler (CC) to create the JS release build. CC is also dependent on Guava. The latest CC is dependent on a more recent version of Guava than Falcon. This creates warnings and errors when trying to use FalconJx to create a release build.
It seems good practice to keep all dependencies up to date. With the reliance on Guava r08, we're limited to versions of CC prior to sept. 17, 2012 and also limited to versions of the Closure Library compatible with the old CC.
One of the issues between the old Guava and new CC is that in newer Guava versions the MapMaker class is deprecated and some of it's members have been 'privatised'. Information on updating to the CacheBuilder class - which replaces MapMaker - can be found here:
