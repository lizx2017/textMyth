Summary:
Mobile Skins difference behaviour
Description:
With the new Apache Flex 4.14.0 we see a new skin on a real Android device however the desktop emulator shows the previous skin.
We should see the same skin and we should also be able to select if we want to use the old version or the modern one.
PS: The same should be applied for iOS.
