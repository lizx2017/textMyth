Summary:
Cannot append child to xml
Description:
var xml1:XML = <node><childnode/></node>;
var xml2:XML = <node/>;
xml2.appendChild(xml1.childnode[0]);
xml1.appendChild(<newnode/>);
trace(xml1.toXMLString());
Output:
<node>
<childnode/>
</node>
Expected Output:
<node>
<childnode/>
<newnode/>
</node>
Workaround:
Make a copy of the childnode and append the copy to the second xml node.
or
Remove the childnode before appending it to the second xml node.
Additional notes:
When you hit this bug, it is very hard to debug since there is no apparent reason it is happening and no stack traces. Another solution to this problem may be to just throw a stack trace when you try to append the same xml to two different xml parents, so that it's easier to find and fix the problem.
