Summary:
List for mobile ios and android no longer scrolls
Description:
when using mxml as following:
<s:VGroup width="100%" height="100%" includeIn="version">
<s:Button id="btnFull" label="Without header" click="btnFull_clickHandler(event)"/>
<s:List id="versionList" width="100%" height="100%" fontSize="32" color="0x000000" labelField="label" change="versionList_changeHandler(event)">
</s:List>
</s:VGroup>
the List shows all the item renderer on screen, on touch shows a scrollbar, but it doesn't react to touch scrolling. It will just dispatch change event on the 1st item touch. No more scrolling on mobile list.
