Summary:
UIComponent->CreateChildren can be called more than once
Description:
UIComponent has a flaw which can result in createChildren() to be called more than once.
UIComponent->initialize() check if the initialized flag has been set but this flag is not synchronously set in that method; Instead it is set by LayoutManager at some point later.
An easy way to make the bug surface is by involving SkinnableContainer and its _placeHolderGroup. See the simple example attached where I add a component with one button but we see two buttons on the screen.
I guess a different flag than initialized needs to be introduced ?
Thanks
--------------------
Workaround:
If you are seeing the bug using SkinnableContainer, you could wait till the skin (or contentGroup skin part) is available before adding any element.
