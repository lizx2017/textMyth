Summary:
Placing list item renderers on certain negative z coordinates results in a Flash Player crash.
Description:
The issue is related to applying custom 3d layouts on a Spark list. If the layout sets a negative z coordinate to a list item, FP crashes. The crash occurs only for certain coordinates that appear to be related to the perspective projection's focal length. E.g. for a focal length of 480, if z coordinate <= -457, app crashes, otherwise not. Another example is for focal length of 200 and a limit of -190 on z.
Note that the crash only occurs when setting the layout on a Spark list with an item renderer containing an Image control(Spark or MX; a simple Spark BitmapImage doesn't seem to trigger the crash).
Also, the crash occurs only on machines that have fp 11.1.102.55 installed (Chrome, Firefox, IE9, release and debugger). On 11.0.1.152 and previous versions, the crash doesn't happen. The app was compiled with playerglobal.swc for both 10.3 and 11, with the same results.
I've attached a simple test case that illustrates this behavior.
