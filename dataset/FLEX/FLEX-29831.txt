Summary:
Automation framework floods trace log with messages
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create an app with an image, that is getting it's images from a Flash image SWC
2. Run app under automation
Actual Results:
Various messages in the trace log such as:
Error #2007: Parameter definitionName must be non-null.
Unable to find definition for class : null
Expected Results:
No messages in the trace log
This isn't the only place that the automation framework dumps messages to the trace log.
The framework should not be tracing ANYTHING except exceptional errors (such as automation couldn't load). It makes it hard to debug when there's completely irrelevant messages being flooded in the trace log. The Flex framework doesn't trace anything, nor should the automation framework.
