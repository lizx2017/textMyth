Summary:
Delegate object couldnot be created
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Set up a project to use automation.
2. Create an instance of a component that has skinparts and who's delegate adds listeners to the skinpart in the delegates constructor (spark.components.ComboBox is a good example).
3. Add the element to a container.
public function SparkComboBoxAutomationImpl(obj:spark.components.ComboBox)
{
super(obj);
obj.textInput.addEventListener(KeyboardEvent.KEY_DOWN, textKeyDownHandler, false, 0 , true);
obj.textInput.addEventListener(AutomationRecordEvent.RECORD,
textInput_recordHandler, false, 0, true)
}
Actual Results:
The following is outputed the the console and no delegate is created for the component.
AutomationManager:createDelegate() - Error #1009: Cannot access a property or method of a null object reference.
AutomationManager:createDelegate() - Delegate object couldnot be created
Expected Results:
A delegate should be created.
Workaround (if any):
The delegate should add a listener to the component for PART_ADDED, then when the correct skin part is added the listener can be added to it, instead of adding the listener in the constructor.
