Summary:
Horizontal and Vertical GridLines show on top of renderer during open animation with variableRowHeight=true
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create an ADG with variableRowHeight="true" with a renderer for it's child that displays somthing, see attached project.
2. Open a row
3. Notice the gridlines during opening
Actual Results:
As the item opens, the gridlines show up on top as the renderer appears.
Expected Results:
The renderer should show up on top of the gridlines so the gridlines aren't visible during opening.
Workaround (if any):
You can override drawHorizontalLine() to draw lines for items that aren't affected by the opening, thus creating a gap for the renderer to slide in, but it doesn't solve the vertical line issue.
