Summary:
Double-clicking on a chart either dispatches a combination of "itemClick" and "itemDoubleClick" events, or dispatches 2 "itemClick" events
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a chart and add an Event Listener for both "itemClick" and "itemDoubleClick" events for the given chart
2. In the event listener function, trace the "event.type" value
3. Perform both single- and double-click operations on the chart and observe the trace output
Actual Results:
When double-clicking an item in the chart, the dispatched ChartItemEvent shows one of two behaviors:
1. "itemClick" dispatched along with a following "itemDoubleClick"
2. Two "itemClick" events dispatched, one after the other, rather than an "itemDoubleClick" event
Attached is an MXML file with which I was able to reproduce this defect. The code is taken from Adobe's "Using Bar Charts" live-docs site (http://livedocs.adobe.com/flex/3/html/help.html?content=charts_types_03.html), which describes how to create a bar chart. I added event listeners for the aforementioned events and created a function to output their event types while running in debug mode.
Expected Results:
When single-clicking on an item in the chart, I would expect the "itemClick" event to be dispatched. When double-clicking an item, I would expect an "itemDoubleClick" event to be dispatched (without the trailing "itemClick"). In either case, the double-click should exhibit consistent and reliable behavior so we can safely distinguish between the two user operations. At no time would I expect a double-click to emit two "itemClick" events unless the user is purposefully performing single-clicks with a period of latency between.
The latency period is ambiguous, which is understandable; different operating systems may specify different periods. Within the Flex framework, however, I am observing inconsistency with the event dispatched, while maintaining the same basic timing (w/in a few milliseconds).
