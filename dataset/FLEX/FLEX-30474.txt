Summary:
Spark DataGrid and cell do not get recognized with QTP when data providers are assigned using actionscript
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
-Use sample application 'SparkDataGridDeutscheBank182704213.mxml'
-Try to record against the Spark DataGrid "mySparkGrid1" and "mySparkGrid2" i.e. first two Data Grids
Note : Check how the dataproviders are assigned to Spark DataGrids "mySparkGrid1" and "mySparkGrid2" using Actionscript
-Try to record against the Spark DataGrid "mySparkGrid3" and "mySparkGrid4" i.e. last two Data Grids
Note : Check how the dataproviders are assigned to Spark DataGrids "mySparkGrid3" and "mySparkGrid4" using MXML
Actual Results:
-recording against the Spark DataGrid "mySparkGrid1" and "mySparkGrid2" does not record any automation scripts.
-recording against the Spark DataGrid "mySparkGrid3" and "mySparkGrid4" records automation scripts.
Expected Results:
Spark DataGrid "mySparkGrid1" and "mySparkGrid2" should get recognized by QTP.
Additional Information :
The behavior has been confirmed in SDK 4.5 and SDK 4.5.1
Workaround (if any):
-Assigning data provider using MXML binding
-Assigning Data Provider inline
Catch:
Spark Data Grids which change data providers dynamically would not record automation scripts.
