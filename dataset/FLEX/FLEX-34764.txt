Summary:
ActionBar Now 20px Off When Using Flex 4.14
Description:
After upgrading the SDK to 4.14 from 4.13, and using the compiler directive -"includes=mx.utils.LegacyMobileThemeOverride", my mobile app now suffers from the 20px offset that iOS 7 introduced. Now the ActionBar is no longer pushed down the 20px as in 4.13.
