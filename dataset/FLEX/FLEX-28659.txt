Summary:
Range no longer enforces snapInterval correctly
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run the attached SWF
2. Click the button
Actual Results:
Values of components goes to 12
Expected Results:
Value of components should go to 8.
Maximum=100
snapInterval=4
Value set by button click is 9.9. Should round down to 8, not up to 12. If the value set was 10 or greater, should round up to 12. This was the previous behavior.
