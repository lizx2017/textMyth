Summary:
Minimizing an AIR application containing an AdvancedDataGrid does not return the ADG's columns to their previous widths when the AIR app has been restored
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create an AIR application (see attached)
2. Add an AdvancedDataGrid with some columns' resizable property set to false
3. Run the application
4. Minimize the application
5. Restore the application
Actual Results:
Upon being restored to its previous size, the AIR application shows an ADG with some columns wider and some columns smaller than they were before.
Expected Results:
The ADG column widths should be exactly the same when restored from being minimized.
Workaround (if any):
Add horizontalScrollPolicy="on" but that does not give the desired look: having all columns visible without needing to horizontally scroll.
