Summary:
Unable to click on depth 2 AdvancedDatagrid Itemrenderer for Flex 3.2
Description:
Steps to reproduce: Please see the attached files. Run the application "SavedSearchDataGrid.mxml". You can see a Advanced datagrid initialized from "FMDatagridComponent.as" with hardcoded arraycollection in hierarichal dataformat. Also this Advanced datagrid uses two renderers
a)DepthONeItemRenderer.as --> for depth 1 of hirarchy (ignore this when debugging as this is workign fine)
b)DepthTwoItemRendere.as --->for depth 2 of hirarchy (this has issues)
Steps to reproduce:
1. Expand all the items in the Advanced datagrid.
2. Click on "Add Data" button. This will change the dataprovider of datagrid in "FMDatagridComponent.as".
3. Now expand all items in tree and then try to click 1st 3 items one by one. Most of the time you are not able to click on second item of the depth two.Please refer snapshot.(not sure why)
Actual Results: We are not able to click on few initial elements , in the depth two of the hirarchy. This looks like item renderer is not getting allocated when we are refreshig new data with added elements. (Please see the snapshot attached)
Expected Results:We should be able to click on all the items of the AdvancedDatagrid for this sample
Workaround (if any): Only workaround that I found was to create the Datagrid component once again in getter and setters and initialize it once again from begining. This works as if we are once again building a new component for Advanced DataGrid.But this is highly memory inefficient.
