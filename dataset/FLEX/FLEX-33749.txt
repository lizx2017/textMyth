Summary:
controlBarGroup in spark TitleWindowSkin should not be colorized
Description:
same issue as 33748: controlBarGroup should be in the exclusions.
the effect is that anything in the control bar that has already a spark skin (eg. buttons, etc..) appears darker or more saturated that elsewhere.
I subclassed the skin to add the exclusions and it now looks ok (see screenshots)
