Summary:
AdvancedDataGrid disables auto update of underlying collection and does not always reenable it
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Point 2 different AdvancedDataGrids to the same ArrayCollection
2.In one grid edit one field and then exit by moving to another field on the same row
3.The ItemEditEnd handler in the ADG calls disableAutoUpdate on the underlying collection
Actual Results:
Updates in one collection are not seen by both grids
Expected Results:
Updates in one collection should be seen by both grids
Workaround (if any):
Override the itemEditEnd event handler and add the following code:
// Don't let the base class handle this
// In some cases it turns off autoUpdate on the underlying collection
// and never turns it back on
// Which also breaks other views that use this collection
event.preventDefault();
dataGrid.destroyItemEditor();
