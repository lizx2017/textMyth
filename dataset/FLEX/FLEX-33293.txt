Summary:
Prompt not displayed when component is inside a PopUpAnchor
Description:
When you use an input component that has a `prompt` property in combination with a PopUpAnchor, the prompt text is never displayed.
Easily reproduced:
<s:PopUpAnchor displayPopUp="true">
<s:VGroup>
<s:TextInput prompt="test prompt in PopupAnchor"/>
<s:ComboBox prompt="test prompt in PopupAnchor"/>
<s:TextArea prompt="test prompt in PopupAnchor"/>
</s:VGroup>
</s:PopUpAnchor>
"test prompt in PopupAnchor" is not displayed in any of the components.
The bug does not affect DropDownList though; so basically it seems to affect only those components that inherit from or compose a SkinnableTextBase.
