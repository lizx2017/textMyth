Summary:
StageText components receiving focus do not always cause softKeyboard to appear
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Import the attached FlashBuilder project and run on an Android device
2. Click (touch) the TextInput
3. If the softKeyboard appears, click on the Button a couple of times, then back on the TextInput. While intermittent, I can consistently cause this failure
Actual Results:
TextInput takes focus and focusIn events are dispatched, yet the SoftKeyboard does not appear. Also reproduces with TextArea.
Expected Results:
SoftKeyboard appears anytime the TextInput or TextArea gets focus
