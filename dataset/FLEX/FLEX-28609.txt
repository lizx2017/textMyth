Summary:
BorderContainer mobile skin
Description:
BorderContainer is discouraged for the mobile theme since 4.5. However, it already uses an ActionScript skin. The only optimizations that we need to make is to base it on UIComponent, use manual layout, and replace the Spark primitives with Graphics API calls. Adding a mobile skin for BorderContainer would make our ActionScript-only skinning message more consistent.
