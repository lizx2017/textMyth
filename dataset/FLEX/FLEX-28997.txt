Summary:
Flex Modules not taking correct Context root ( not taking correct channels and endpoints) when switching happend between modules in the same Application.
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create Module A and Module B with different contexts and services for each module(Each module should contains their own context root and services-config.xml and java classes Just like module A war file and Module B war file).
3. Create two view stacks v1 and v2 in the Application.
2. First load A1( Use Module A for A1 and A2) into v1 view stack, everything works fine. Service calls work fine.
3. Second load B1( Use Module B for B1 and B2) into v2 view stack, everything works fine in B1 module. Service calls work fine.
4. And now come back and load A2 into v1 view stack. Now the service calls for A2 module fails as it is trying to use the B2 channel definition, context root and endpoints.
And you can reproduce this by trying vice versa.
We are getting run time exception and catching that in remote object fault event. We are using Module Manger to load each module dynamically into application.
We are compiling each and every module by giving compiler options -services( using services-config.xml file)
We are using spring-blazeds. We found this issue exists in blazeds also.
Please suggest the best option to get this work. And also please provide detailed information about why this is happening. It should take default channels from their own context but it doesn't.
