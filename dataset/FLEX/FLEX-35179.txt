Summary:
When extend a class, an import for the class is required
Description:
If you try to extend a FlexJS class (i.e: List) you should do it like this_
public class List extends org.apache.flex.html.List
but compiler fails reporting that there's missing import
The workaround is add:
import org.apache.flex.html.List;
But this should not be required
