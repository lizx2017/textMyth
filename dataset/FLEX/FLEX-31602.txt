Summary:
CSS Design View preview for charts and series should show some data
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Add a CSS file to your Flex Builder project
2. Create style rules for BarChart {} and BarSeries {}
3. Adjust some of the charting-specific styles
Actual Results:
For the most part, the data-less preview does not change. (In the case of BarSeries, there is no preview at all).
Expected Results:
Previews should show a chart with sample data so that I can see the effects of the styles I am setting.
Workaround (if any):
Attach your CSS to an MXML file containing a dummy/default chart. Each time you make a change, save the CSS file and tab over to the MXML file to see the effect of your change.
