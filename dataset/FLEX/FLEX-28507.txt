Summary:
SplitViewNavigator viewNavigatorCallout should be typed SkinnablePopUpContainer
Description:
SplitViewNavigator's viewNavigatorCallout skin part is currently typed Callout. This forces the component to use a callout component when displaying a navigator in a popup. Since SplitViewNavigator isn't dependent on any code in Callout, the skinpart should be typed SkinnablePopUpContainer. This will give the developer the freedom to use any popup component with the navigator. Specifically, it will allow developers to slide in the master view as seen on some tablet applications (Flixter, iOS 5 mail app).
