Summary:
QTP automation is unable to identify the pre-defined objects in a VBScript file
Description:
We are QTP customer. We don't do recording for our automation since recording scripts cannot be reused. We script automation with VBScript. For example, we usualy create a pre-defined objects file and functions in VBScript, and they will be loaded when we run a test script, which only includes the function calls.
But it does not work with our Flex application.
Below is a sample case.
Steps to reproduce:
1. create a pre-defined object file, test_object.vbs and save it in C. The test_objects.vbs is shown below:
'Login screen
Set IEBrowser = Window("regexpwndtitle := Windows Internet Explorer", "text := Hitachi Storage Command Portal - Windows Internet Explorer")
Set MyFlexApp = IEBrowser.FlexApplication("automatiionname:=app", "id := app")
Set HSCP = MyFlexApp.FlexApplication("automatiionname:=hirex-1.0_alpha.swf")
'
'login field
Set login = HSCP.FlexTextArea ("automationname := User ID:username", "id := username")
2. launch QTP 9.2, select Expert View, writing the script for a case as below. Save it as "Test2"
ExecuteFile("C:\test_objects.vbs")
login.set "system"
3. Run the case
Actual Results: Run Error (please refer to screenshots) since the objects defined in the test_object.vbs were not able to be identified.
Expected Results: The User ID field on the login screen will be set to "system"
Workaround (if any): No.
