Summary:
Calling createDeferredContent on a SkinnableContainer with creationPolicy == none and with a single child doesn't create the child
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a SkinnableContainer with creationPolicy = 'none'
2. Add a single element in the SkinnableContainer
3. Call createDeferredContent for the SkinnableContainer
Actual Results:
The content of the SkinnableContainer is not created
Expected Results:
The content of the SkinnableContainer should be created and added to the view
Workaround (if any):
The problem is in the createDeferredContent method in SkinnableContainer where _mxmlContentFactory is expected to return an array but returns a single element. When this element is casted to Array it returns null, thus mxmlContent will be null.
