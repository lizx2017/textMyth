Summary:
when used as a tileList.itemRenderer my custom columnChart will not display series data after setting vertical axis minimum value to any value other than default NaN
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create custom mxml columnchart component (named "slxSingleColumnChart") and set vertical axis minimum to any desired value
2. Create an mxml application that initializes the data and dataProvider for columnChart using actionscript to populate arrays
3. Create a new tileList in mxml using actionscript â€“ var myTileList:TileList = new TileList();
4. Defined row and column size of myTileList
4. Used chartRenderer:ClassFactory = new ClassFactory(slxSingleColumnChart)
5. Assigned myTileList.itemRenderer = chartRenderer
6.
Actual Results: tileList rendered column chart fails to display series data
Expected Results: columnchart series data should display columns for the data series provided (works fine when vertical axis minimun is left at default)
