Summary:
Apache Flex 4.16.1 Mobile Components SWC shows UI display errors
Description:
I was using the default Flex SDK which comes with Flash Builder 4.7 Premium
including the Mobile Components (mobilecomponents.swc)
This is the result I get when I use the default Flex SDK 4.6.0
  This is the result I get when I switch to Apache Flex 4.16.1
  Can someone pin point down where should I look for the problem?
