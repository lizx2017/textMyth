Summary:
FalconJX generates incorrect paths in deps.js
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Compile FlexJSTest_again example using FalconJX on Windows.
2. Check deps.js in FlexJSTest_again/bin/js-debug/library/closure/goog/
deps.js contains invalid paths like '../../../../D:\WORK\Projects\ApacheFlex\repo\falcon\compiler.jx\bin/D:\WORK\Projects\ApacheFlex\repo\asjs\examples\FlexJSTest_again\bin\js-debug\org\apache\flex\net\HTTPHeader.js'
Due to incorrect paths in deps.js when trying to open js-debug /index.html in Firefox I get a bunch of JavaScript errors, the first being "SyntaxError: malformed Unicode character escape sequence" at deps.js line 4.
More details:
The bug comes from com.google.javascript.jscomp.deps.PathUtil.isAbsolute() function. It is implemented by simply checking that the path starts by a forward slash which of course is incorrect under Windows.
com.google.javascript.jscomp.deps.PathUtil.isAbsolute() is used by com.google.javascript.jscomp.deps.DepsGenerator.computeDependencyCalls() which is called by MXMLFlexJSPublisher to generate deps.js.
