Summary:
In Flex automation framework, not able to locate the Flex objects that are declared as dynamic
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
We have in our tool the ability to declare Flex objects as dynamic objects. Declaring as dynamic objects will become independent of hiearchy. We are aware of the fact that in Flex objects are identified using the automation id which includes the hiearchy aswell. Now if we declare an object as dynamic, the hiearchy will be lost. So does it mean that we cannot declare any Flex object as dynamic?
Actual Results:
The dynamic Flex objects are not able to be identified
Expected Results:
The dynamic Flex objects should be identified
