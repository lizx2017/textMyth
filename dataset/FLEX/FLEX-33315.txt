Summary:
selectedItem returns [] after setting it to [], and selecting an item
Description:
Setting AdvancedDataGrid's selectedItems to [] in the grid's creation complete handler causes it to never update it's selected items array (if the dataprovider is initially empty).
Expected: selectedItems has the selectedItems that are visually represented by the grid.
Results: selectedItems is always empty.
