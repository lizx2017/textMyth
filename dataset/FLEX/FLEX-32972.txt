Summary:
NumericAxis autoAdjust doesn't work with multiple series with different dataProviders on SDK 4.5
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Build a project with the sample file and 4.5 SDK.
2. Run and wait for HttpResult to fill the chart with one serie.
3. Click on "Add More Series To Chart" Button, and two new series added, one of them with date value 01/11/2009.
4. Now click on "Reset" button, and the new series disappear.
The horizontal and vertical axis should come back to initial state but it doesn't!
If you build this with 4.1 SDK, it works fine.
The sample file was taken from http://help.adobe.com/en_US/flex/using/WS2db454920e96a9e51e63e3d11c0bf69084-7bff.html
I just added a few lines to reproduce the error.
