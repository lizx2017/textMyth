Summary:
ADG does not load with scroll bar in case of grouped field at runtime
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a flex project / AIR project
2. Create a Data Service which fetches more than 10 records
3. Drag a ADG - Tree Preview
4. Associate data service in step 2 with ADG - Make sure you mention a field in "Group by Field" clause
5. Make sure the height parameter of ADG is small such that all the records are not seen upfront.
6. Run
Actual Results: ADG loads without the vertical scroll bar. If a user wants to access the last record in ADG - he/she won't be able to do so.
Expected Results: ADG should load with vertical scroll bar in case the records are not completely seen in the ADG view
Workaround (if any): Click on the arrow ">" and click the same again. Scroll bar appears.
