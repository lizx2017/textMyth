Summary:
groupedColumns breaks coloring of colored columns when scrolling
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Have an application that uses an AdvancedDataGrid (using <mx:columns>) that scrolls horizontally and has at least one column set its backgroundColor property.
2. Run it and scroll horizontally. Everything is fine.
3. Now replace <mx:columns> with <mx:groupedColumns> and run it.
4. When you scroll now you will see that the coloring of the colored column doesn't follow the column and is fixed in place.
I've attached a sample application to show the problem.
Actual Results:
When scrolling horizontally the coloring of the colored column doesn't follow the column and stays fixed in place.
Expected Results:
Coloring should follow the column when scrolled.
