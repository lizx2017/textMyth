BubbleSeries min and maxRadius are reset after they are assigned to a bubbleChart
Description:
Steps to reproduce:

2. Set the min and maxRadius
3. Set the series to a bubbleChart <code>bubbleChart.series=[bubbleSeries]</code>
Actual Results:
min and maxRadius properties are set to the min and max radius of the bubbleChart. (or 0 and 50 (the defaults) if the max and minRadius of the bubbleChart is not explicitly set)
