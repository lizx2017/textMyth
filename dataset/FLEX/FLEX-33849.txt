Summary:
Wrong version contant in FlexVersion.as
Description:
Version number reported in FlexVersion.as is incorrect:
public static const VERSION_4_10:uint = 0x04100000;
should be:
public static const VERSION_4_10:uint = 0x040A0000;
Working in hexadecimal here, not decimal
As of now, we get Version 4.16.0 once converted into String.
