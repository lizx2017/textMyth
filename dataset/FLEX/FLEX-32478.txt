Summary:
Wierd rendering of charts for large values (ranging around 1000000) when filterData="false"
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a flex project.
2. Copy and paste the attached mxml file Column_Bar.mxml
3. Run the application
Actual Results: We can see that the chart to the left is not rendered as expected because
1. The "gold" series for China is taking up more space than expected. (refer to the attached screen shot)
2. There is a slight change in color for all the series (compare the color of the chart to the left with that of the right)
[note:
a. The only difference between the 2 charts is, the left charts uses linearAxis and the right one uses LogAxis. Hence the issue is only when we are using linearAxis.
b. The issue is prevalent even in other charts. I have verified for line and BarCharts.
c. When i used Firefox, i could reproduce both the actual results, 1 and 2. When i used IE, i could reproduce only Actual Result # 2 ]
Expected Results: The chart to the left should be rendered properly
