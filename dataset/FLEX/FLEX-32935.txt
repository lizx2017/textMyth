Summary:
In AdvancedDataGrid with GroupingCollection, when itemClick is fired event.currentTarget.selectedItem can be wrong after expanding/collapsing a node.
Description:
After expanding/collapsing a node an itemClick event gives a wrong selectedItem object : instead of actual element one gets the element that was on the same line before expanding/collapsing.
Steps to reproduce:
1. In the AdvancedDataGrid, expand node "2"
2. Click element "C", the TextArea shows "C"
3. Expand node "1" and click element "B", the TextArea shows "C" again.
Actual Results: C and C
Expected Results: C and B
Wrong result also with :
1. expand "1" and click "B", get "B".
2. collapse "1" and expand "2"
3. click "C", get "B".
An equivalent code works correctly in Flex 3.5.
