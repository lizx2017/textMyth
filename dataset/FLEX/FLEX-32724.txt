Summary:
When we drag a editable cell, a wrong row is selected after we drop the row.
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. run the attached source
2. drag a cell of the second COL BBB from the bottom.
3. drop the cell into the second row from the top
Actual Results:
sometimes correct row is selected, but wrong row is selected often.
