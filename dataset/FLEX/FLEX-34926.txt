Summary:
Misplaced [PercentProxy] metatag in GridColumn
Description:
The [PercentProxy("percentWidth")] metatag is misplaced in spark.components.gridClasses - right now it is placed before the percentWidth property, making the proxy refer to itself (and thus has no effect in Flash Builder). It should be placed before the width property itself to make Flash Builder recognize percentages when using <s:GridColumn width="100%" /> in MXML.
