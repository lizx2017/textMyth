Summary:
Disappearing spark DataGrid columns when we set dataProvider to null
Description:
This is an example of an application with problems we have noticed on our main appliaction.
Instructions:
We've got 2 views added dynamically to app.
1) Click on button "View 1" - DataGrid looks Ok (fill dataProvider on ADDED_TO_STAGE event)
2) Click on button "View 2" - DataGrid still looks Ok (set null to View 1's dataProvider on REMOVED_FROM_STAGE event)
3) Click once again on button with "View 1" - Columns in DataGrid accidentally disappear) -> http://bit.ly/GORcrb
4) Roll over on data grid's header and everything is back to normal - columns appearing
