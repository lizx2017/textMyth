Summary:
Item Snapping incorrect after orientation change
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Load sample app on device (I used a Nexus One, but any Android device should be fine)
2. Rotate to landscape orientation
3. Scroll to the right until you see "17"
4. Rotate to portrait orientation
5. Scroll to the left once
Actual Results:
"17" scroll into view again. It takes two page scrolls to see "16". This continues for all pages until you reach the beginning.
Expected Results:
Paging to the left should work.
