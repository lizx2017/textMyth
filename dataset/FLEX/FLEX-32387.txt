Summary:
getStyle("fill") returns undefined when applied to a chart series.
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
var sc:SolidColor = new SolidColor(0xccebc5, 1);
var series1:ColumnSeries = new ColumnSeries();
series1.setStyle("fill", sc) ;
trace(" setstyle fill = " + series1.getStyle("fill" ));
Actual Results:
trace shows "undefined" ... note that the setStyle works - you can change the fill colors just as the docs say you can, but if you want to find out what they are, for a custom legend for example, you get "undefined" and no error - the legend just has no color at all.
Expected Results:
geStyle("fill") returns a SolidColor
Workaround (if any):
Obviously you can independently manage the colors, but this is klugey and liable to break when series contents are dynamic.
