Summary:
XMLListCollection dataprovider is not working
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. User wants to provide any XML data as a dataprovider for the OLAP DG..
2. Construct an XMLListCollection object from the XML and provide it as dataprovider
PS: Use the bug file for your referance
Actual Results:
XMLListCollection data provider is not working. It throws error.
Expected Results:
XMLListCollection should work fine
Workaround (if any):
Possible work-around in this scenario where a user wants to provide this object as an input, either using an xml file or using a HTTPService could be: get the result in the form of an arraycollection and pass it as an input.. but not sure if that works.
