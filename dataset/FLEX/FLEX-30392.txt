Summary:
QTP doesn't record any FLEX objects
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Install the following required software on the test machine:
+ ActiveX version of the debugger version of Flash Player 10
+ Flex QTP add-ins
+ Flash Builder SDK 4
+ IE8
+ Apache server
2. Compiled codes using the -include-library option. The following automation swc files are included:
automation.swc
automation_agent.swc
automation_dmv.swc
automation_spark.swc
automation_flashflexkit.swc
qtp.swc
Per the resolution in https://bugs.adobe.com/jira/browse/FLEXENT-1271 , the compiler's Build Path (Project Library path) does not include the automation swcs above.
3. Deployed codes to local web server (Apache) using instruction on page #4 from the following Adobe doc: http://help.adobe.com/en_US/Flex/4.0/TestingQTP/flex_4.0_testingqtp.pdf
3. Launch QTP. At Add-in Manager dialog, verify the ActiveX, Flex, and Web Add-in's are checked.
4. Launch the test app using the HTML wrapper page:
http://localhost/Flex4App/HTMLWrapper.html
5. Started QTP recording session. Started clicking on flex object like buttons, selecting list item, typing text into text field, etc.
6. Stop the recording.
Actual Results:
Nothing captured.
Expected Results:
QTP scripts should display something like:
Browser("...").Page("...").flexButton("Apply").Click
Browser("...").Page("...").flexTextArea("Enter name:").Type "Smith"
Browser("...").Page("...").flexList("Month").Select "Jul"
Workaround (if any):
Using FireFox during the recording. Something got captured, but nothing related to Flex objects.
Window("..").WinObject("Gecko").CLick x,y
Note that regardless of whatever click (button, text field, list box, the same WinObject("Gecko").CLick x,y with different coordinates were recorded.
