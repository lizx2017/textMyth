Summary:
Some Flex links not working when compiled with automation files
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. We have a very complex Flex application with overlapping stylesheets. There are links on the left and right of the screen which takes us to different screens when clicked.
2. This application is compiled with the automation files (-locale=en_US -source-path=../locale/
{locale},../properties -services services-config.xml -default-background-color #ffffff -include-libraries ../libs/automation_agent.swc ../libs/automation_dmv.swc ../libs/automation.swc ../libs/qtp.swc)
3. This is a major issue for us where if not solved we wont be able to automate the application.

Actual Results:
Links on the right side do not work. Even QTP does not recognize these links. All other buttons, links, etc are properly recognized by QTP.

Expected Results:
All the links should work as expected.

Workaround (if any):
When the same application is compiled without the automation files (-locale=en_US -source-path=../locale/{locale}
,../properties -services services-config.xml -default-background-color #ffffff ), the links work fine. But now since we compile without the automation files, QTP cannot recognize nay of the objects in the application
