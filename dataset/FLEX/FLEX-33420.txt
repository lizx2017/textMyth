Summary:
poppedViewReturnedObject destroyed too early
Description:
Description of poppedViewReturnedObject:
"This object is guaranteed to be valid when the new view receives the <code>add</code> event, and is destroyed after the view receives a <code>viewActivate</code> event.</p>"
The last part is wrong - poppedViewReturnedObject is destroyed BEFORE the viewActivate event occurs.
