Summary:
Scrollbar does not appear when needed
Description:
In certain cases, a scrollbar does not appear when needed
I've attached a simple app that demonstrates the problem.
Issue found with Flex SDK 4.5.1.
Here is more detail:
What we expect: When the Panel in the example is sized smaller horizontally than its content, the content should be clipped and a horizontal scrollbar should appear.
What we see: The Panel clips the content, but no horizontal scrollbar appears.
We would expect the fixed content width of the TileLayout (due to its preferredColumns property being set) in the Group with id 'innerGroup' to give us horizontal scrolling when the Panel is sized to a smaller width than that Group. The additional setting of a minWidth property on this same Group as "insurance" should mean we at least see horizontal scrolling when we hit that width. Instead, the Group continues to size down past its content, and then past its set minWidth. As a result, no horizontal scrollbars ever appear.
The behavior is replicated by having a UIComponent with a percentage width set that contains a Scroller wrapped around a Group with width set to 100%, and inside that Group, another (inner) Group with width set to 100%. Regardless of the size of the contents of that inner group, or what you set for measuedWidth & measuredMinWidth in measure() or what you set width to in setContentSize() in updateDisplayList(), you will never get the Scroller to display a horizontal scroll bar.
