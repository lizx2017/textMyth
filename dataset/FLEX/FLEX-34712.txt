Summary:
Callout loses anchor to CalloutButton while callout open and screen rotates
Description:
When debugging on android device, rotating device from landscape to portrait and then back again causes callout to lose its positioning to the calloutbutton. It works good on the simulator, but on the device, it seems that the positioning is called before the screen finishes rotating. Tested on 3 different android devices with android 2.3.6, 4.2.2, and 4.4.
workaround: patching callout.as
in systemManager_resizeHandler, change invalidatePosition() to callLater(invalidatePosition). This gives the necessary delay to allow the popup to position itself in the correct location. It looks a little buggy as it moves from the old position to the new position, but atleast it gets to the right spot.
