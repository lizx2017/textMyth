Summary:
Calling invalidateProperties() in overridden horizontalScrollPosition() causes Tabbing Focus to fail when moving to Grouped Columns
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create SDK 4.1 Project with attached ADGInvalidateProperties.mxml and InvalidatingAdvancedDataGrid.as
2. Run application.
3. Use the "InvalidatingDataGrid with grouped columns" output
4. Select first cell in first row
5. Use Tab to cycle along row focus
Actual Results:
Focus moves along each cell into itemEditor
When the cell is under a Grouped Column, the itemEditors no longer appear
Expected Results:
Tabbing to allow moving along row and itemEditor to appear.
Workaround (if any):
Adding validateNow() to horizontalScrollPosition() override allows the Grouped columns to Tab correctly.
But the "InvalidatingAdvancedDataGrid with normal columns" then fails with an RTE
