Summary:
Summary Row isn't calculated on GroupingCollection2.refresh()
Description:
Within this example we simply would like to update the summary total when you move out of the itemEditEnd event. Within this example it works however not until you tab several times. It seems that some event maybe suppressed and not bubbling up until the third Tab.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run the attached example.
2. Click "Use your data".
3. Change Row "BHG" Column "Q1" value 11 to 100
4. Click tab "3" times.
Actual Results: Total value isn't updated to "211" till after the third "tab".
Expected Results: When you move focus out of the item the Total should update.
Workaround (if any): None.
