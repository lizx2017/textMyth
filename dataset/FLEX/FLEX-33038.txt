Workaround (if any):
Tried the solution as per this URL www.thedanosphere.com/2010/05/20/removing-flex-data-visualization-watermark-flex-3-to-flash-builder-4/
in my machine and I am able to remove the trial version watermark.
Just I need to keep flex 3 license reference & remove flex 4.5 license reference from C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Adobe\Flex\license.properties configuration file every time while making new build
