Summary:
[FlexJS] MDL - Bracketed binding is broken to various components
Description:
Bracketed binding is broken to many a components in FlexJS MDL implementation. Lately this bracketed binding mostly fixed now to FlexJS regular components. The kind of approach/output also expects from the MDL components as well.
I'm attaching herewith a project, running which almost shows nothing but some bounding boxes (components) without texts; Since they will all fail to render data/values in a bracketed binding way. Here's some details what components were taken to this example and what they were suppose to do. Although, not to making longer the demo example I tried to show by a few components only. But this problem may applies to almost all the components to MDL.
Table binding
Suppose to render a demo Table component. It dataProvider declared in following way instead of using any SimpleBinding or ConstantBinding tags. Not works.
dataProvider="{tableModel.materials}"
List binding
A simple List component tried to bind it's dataProvider to an array declared in same page. Not works.
Button text binding
MDL Button that tried to bind it's text property to a locally declared String field. Not works.
Button 2 text binding
MDL button that tries to bind it's text property that declared in another class. Not works.
text="{classA.subFieldClassA}"
The above button click also sets/changes value in another class' field, which binds to next component.
TextField binding
TextField text that binds to an external class' String field; The value suppose to change when previous button clicked. Not works.
InnerHTML binding
InnerHTML components text field also not works when supplied it's value in a bracketed binding way.
H4 binding
Local String field binding even not works.
Tabs binding
If I use Tab component and if try to feed it's dataProvider in bracketed way, that breaks my application in HTML run throwing following error. So I choose not to include that component here, but this also requires a fix.
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'flexjs_wrapper' of undefined
