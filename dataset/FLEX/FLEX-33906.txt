Description:
I reported this bug in Adobe bugbase id= 3654871
I do it again here because they didn't respond. And this bug is a cross platform issue involving both Flex and Air.
Steps to Reproduce:
1, create an air-android(3.9) app as loader
2, create an flex(4.10.0) app as content
3, flex app uses PopupManager to pop a Panel with TextInput
4, the air app uses SwfLoader to load the flex app by .swf file
5, use the TextInput
Actual Result:
1,keyboard input cannot feed into TextInput in simulator
2,android device pops soft-keyboard when focus on the TextInput, but cannot feed
Expected Result:
feed keys into TextInput
