Summary:
Wrong object encoding when sending via HTTPService or WebService
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create an application that communicates with a HTTPService or a WebService.
2. Create an object holding values for example:
var object : Object = {};
object.inXML = <root><valueElement>Èlan</valueElement></root>
3. Send this object via the HTTPService or WebService and the È-character gets messed up.
Workaround (if any):
On the net a workaround for this problem is being offered. Encoding the strings in the XML with Base64.
