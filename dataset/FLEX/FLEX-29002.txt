Summary:
RunTime Error #1009 at mx.managers::PopUpManagerImpl/addModalPopUpAccessibility() when displaying more than one modal popup via PopUpManager on top of each other. On Windows 7 running on some PCs
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. in the AIR application, create modal popup via popupmanager -> ok.
2. on the popup, create another modal popup via popupmanager (so we have two modal popups one on top of the other) -> RT error #1009.
3. close top popup, due to RT error #1009 modal shade stays on stage and keeps blocking the application.
Actual Results:
Popupmanager closes modal titlewindow, but the modal shade stays on display due to RunTime error #1009 and so application becomes non-operable.
Expected Results:
Popupmanager should close the modal titlewindow along with the modal shade as it does if only one modal popup was invoked.
Workaround (if any):
On Windows7 Control Panel, disable some stuff in control panel (Attachments) and reboot OS. Trully, this works.
Note:
This happens only on Windows 7 OS running on some All-In-One PCs (eg.: MSI AE2050). Bug is connected with the accessibility OS provides, so we can fix the issue by configuring some OS parameters.
