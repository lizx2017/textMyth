Summary:
~15% regression across most/all RadioStations and TransitionsTests fps tests on Android
Description:
In today's run with 4.6.0.22959 & Air 3.1.0.468, we're seeing about a 15% regression across all the RadioStations and TransitionsTests, plus the DateSpinner animation speed test in ComponentCatalog. Most of the SplitViewaNavigatorTransitionTests, however, improved by about the same percentage.
I re-ran all of these test apps with 467 and don't see much difference - slightly better, but most of the regression persists when rolling back the runtime.
See the attached full reports - Report1 show the original regression in 4.6.0.22959, Report2 shows the deltas > 10% with only the runtime rolled back to 467.
