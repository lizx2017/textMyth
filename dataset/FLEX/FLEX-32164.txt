Summary:
triggerEvent not populated on AdvancedDataGridEvent ITEM_FOCUS_IN
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Add an event handler to an AdvancedDataGrid's ITEM_FOCUS_IN event
2. Attempt to access and use the triggerEvent property
Actual Results:
The trigger event is never populated. This means we don't have any knowledge of what caused the item to gain focus. In our case, we're trying to find out if the shift key was pressed on the tab event that initially triggered the move into a cell.
Expected Results:
The triggerEvent in this case should probably have the ITEM_EDIT_BEGINNING event that triggered the ITEM_FOCUS_IN event which should in turn have a triggerEvent property that represents the ITEM_EDIT_BEGIN event, etc... back to the KEY_FOCUS_CHANGE or MOUSE_FOCUS_CHANGE event that started the process. The only time this property should probably be false is when the cell is selected by setting editedItemPosition programmatically.
Workaround (if any):
None that I've found so far. I've tried adding an event listener to KEY_DOWN on the grid, and setting a custom property that stores the "lastKeyPressedWithShift" value, but knowing when to reset this property becomes a problem.
