CLONE - Ambiguous reference when using data binding in inherited class with the same name as base class in a different package
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. In attached archive, attempt to compile com/example/extended/Thing.mxml
Actual Results:
$ mxmlc -compiler.strict -compiler.debug -compiler.source-path=. com/example/extended/Thing.mxml
Loading configuration file C:\Flex\sdks\3.0.0.338\frameworks\flex-config.xml
Error: Ambiguous reference to Thing. [Generated code (use -keep to save): Path: com\example\extended\Thing-generated.as,
Line: 188, Column: 10]
Error: Ambiguous reference to Thing. [Generated code (use -keep to save): Path: com\example\extended\Thing-generated.as,
Line: 114, Column: 14]
Expected Results:
Successful compilation.
This only occurs when
(a) Extending class has the same name as base class, but is in a different package .
(b) Extending class makes use of data binding.
Workaround (if any):
Rename one of the classes.
