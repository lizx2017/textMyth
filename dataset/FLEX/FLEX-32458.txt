Summary:
Custom DataTips do not close when mouse rolled out through data tip
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a Pie Chart and apply a custom data tip. (Custom DataTip must be so wide that it is over the edge of the pie chart)
2. Roll mouse over pie chart (popping up an instance of the custom data tip)
3. Roll the mouse off the pie chart through the dataTip.
Actual Results:
1. DataTip stays popped up.
2. Sometimes can instantiate multiple dataTips.
3. DataTips stay in same place on screen even if pie chart scrolls away.
Expected Results:
DataTips close even when the mouse is rolled out through them.
Workaround (if any):
roll the mouse back through the pie chart and roll out outside of the dataTip.
Attached is a simple project that demonstrates this behavior.
Screen shot is an even worse example happening in a much larger app.
