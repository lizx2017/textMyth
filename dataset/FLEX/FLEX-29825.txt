Summary:
QTP closes/crashes when more than component is matched during playback
Description:
I'm using QTP 9.1 and Flex 3.0
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create an app where a component is created from another action (such as a button click) but in a delayed fashion (i.e. create the other component 10 seconds after the button click)
2. Record a script, ensure you record an action that creates the new component, then an action on the new component
3. Playback the script
Actual Results:
QTP crashes
Expected Results:
QTP doesn't crash and waits for the component to exist.
What happens is QTP tries to replay the script on the new component but it doesn't exist yet, Flex returns an error (AutomationError.OBJECT_NOT_UNIQUE) to QTP which causes it crash.
