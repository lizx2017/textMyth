Summary:
If a filter function applied to an AdvancedDataGrid filters *all* the data, an error is thrown when the mouse is moved over the grid body
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Setup an AdvancedDataGrid with a datasource
2. Apply a filter to the datasource such that all data items are excluded
3. Move mouse over the main body of the data grid (anything beneath the column headers)
(see attached file)
Actual Results:
The following error is thrown:
TypeError: Error #1009: Cannot access a property or method of a null object reference.
at mx.controls::AdvancedDataGrid/mouseOverHandler()[C:\Work\flex\dmv_automation\projects\datavisualisation\src\mx\controls\AdvancedDataGrid.as:6404]
at mx.controls.listClasses::AdvancedListBase/mouseMoveHandler()[C:\Work\flex\dmv_automation\projects\datavisualisation\src\mx\controls\listClasses\AdvancedListBase.as:8092]
Expected Results:
There should be no error thrown.
Workaround (if any):
Make the grid non-selectable if the listData property becomes null:
grd.selectable = grd.listData != null;
