Summary:
Editing nested properties using AdvancedDataGridColumnGroups throws a ReferenceError stating it cannot find the property (prop) on the root object (foo), rather than looking at the nested object. (foo.bar)
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create an advanceddatagrid with a collection of foo as the dataProvider, mark as editable
2. Create an AdvancedDataGridColumnGroup, specifying a dataField of 'bar' ( where bar is a property of foo: foo.bar)
3. Create an AdvancedDataGridColumn as a child of the group, using a dataField name (where name is a property of foo.bar: foo.bar.name), mark this column as editable.
(of course you'll need to create a couple data objects to make this work...)
4. Attempt to edit the 'name' column.
Actual Results:
ReferenceError: Error #1069: Property name not found on foo and there is no default value.
at mx.controls::AdvancedDataGridBaseEx/itemEditorItemEditEndHandler()[C:\work\flex\dmv_automation\projects\datavisualisation\src\mx\controls\AdvancedDataGridBaseEx.as:6574]
Expected Results:
foo.bar.name should be updated correctly. The logic in itemEditorItemEditEndHandler needs to do a recursive look up to see if the column has a parent group/column and build a property link.
Workaround (if any):
None
I've attached an example of this bug as a simple project. You can download/build it. Notice you can edit the first name and last name fields just fine, but if you try to edit any of the phone fields, you'll get this exception.
