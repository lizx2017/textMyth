Summary:
Secondary sorts not preserved with AdvancedDataGrid
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Build the attached MXML file
2. Expand either group.
3. Note that the second column is not sorted correctly despite being sorted in the source ArrayCollection
Actual Results:
Secondary sorts not preserved
Expected Results:
All sources I've located seem to indicate that sort should be preserved from the source. Note that expanding grouping to the secondary column brings back the correct sort order.
