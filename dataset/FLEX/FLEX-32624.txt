Summary:
Inconsistent behaviour related to editedItemPosition when entering AdvancedDataGrid cell
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1.
Create an AdvancedDataGrid with item editors, and a timer to detect and trace when the editedItemPosition becomes available.
The timer event function looks something like this:
if(ctlGrid.editedItemPosition != null)
{ rowNumberTimer.stop(); currentRowPos = ctlGrid.editedItemPosition["rowIndex"] as int; trace("Detected current row position @ " + currentRowPos); }
2.
Start the test app and click on a cell. It will show in the trace log:
Detected current row position @ x
3.
Start the test app and click on a cell with text already in it AND select the text at the same time. Nothing will show in the trace log:
Actual Results:
When selecting a cell and selecting the text inside the cell at the same time, I guess some event will not fire and the editedItemPosition will not be available.
Expected Results:
editedItemPosition always available when a cell is clicked
