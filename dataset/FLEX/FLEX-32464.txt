Summary:
OLAP Width
Description:
I found this bug using a custom OLAPDataGrid known as PivotComponent.
Then I test with the native OLAPDataGrid and the bug continues.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run the application
2. See the OLAPDataGrid
Actual Results:
It shows only the texts without the grid lines and the renderers.
Expected Results:
Work as it was meant to be. Because PivotComponent set the width of the columns dynamically, and as the grid becomes larger the bug may occur.
Workaround (if any):
It's something with the width, make it smaller, that will do the trick.
