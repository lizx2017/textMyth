Summary:
Command Keys do not work in standard dialogs launched within desktop application on Mac
Description:
We have a desktop application built for both Windows and Mac, that calls the standard functions to open/save/print. (e.g. flash.filesystem.File.browseForOpen)
We have noticed that when a user is in one of these standard dialogs, they are unable to use the standard edit keypress shortcuts (Cmd+X, Cmd+C, Cmd+V, etc).
Workarounds:-
Right click in the required text box field or select Edit in the top menu, and click the relevant command in the context menu.
