Summary:
.. notation failing in XML
Description:
The following code fails:
var catalog_item = xml..('http://ns.adobe.com/mxml/2009')::catalog_item[0];
The compiler gives the following message:
[mxmlc] Error: '..' is not allowed here
This should be valid E4X. I'm not sure what it is about this expression which is failing. The following does seem to be accepted:
var script:XML = xml..script[0].children()[0];
