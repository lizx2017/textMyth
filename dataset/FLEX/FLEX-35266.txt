Summary:
[FlexJS] MDL Layout Problems
Description:
In this app:
https://paste.apache.org/GCGU
The sliders take unneeded vertical space (due to 2 mdl-slider__container divs being added in runtime). Also, the spans are not aligned with the sliders (because of an unnecessary 40 pxl margin).
Screenshot attached.
