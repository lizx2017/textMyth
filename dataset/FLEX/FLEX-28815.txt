Summary:
Binding a variable to selectedIndex of ComboBox often fails.
Description:
This problem occurs both with Flex SDK 3.6 and 4.5.1. However it almost always works if you run the sample app with debug mode of Flash Builder.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run the attached ComboTest.mxml file.
2. Click 'doInit' button. This sets dataProvider and selectedIndex via bindable variables.
Actual Results:
The value of selectedIndex will be 0. ("Visa")
If you cannot reproduce this, please reload the app and try it again.
Expected Results:
The value of selectedIndex should be 1. ("MasterCard")
