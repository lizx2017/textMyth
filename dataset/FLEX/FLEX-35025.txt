Summary:
Validator results cannot be intercepted if the value is null
Description:
mx.validators.Validator.validate() usually ends up passing its ValidationResultEvent through handleResults(). However, in an edge case (when the value it's validating is null) it dispatches the ValidationResultEvent without passing it through handleResults().
The scenario is: we need to set the field property on the ValidationResultEvent before it leaves the custom validator. This is impossible for the (correct) situation when the value that's being validated is null (which, in our custom validator, is a valid value).
