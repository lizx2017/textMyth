Summary:
Generated require() call for Node.js modules does not produce valid code if module name includes dashes
Description:
The module is defined in ActionScript with metdata using a name that includes a dash.
[JSModule(name="my-module")]
The generated JavaScript code looks like this:
var my-module = require("my-module);
However, that's not a valid variable name. It should produce something like this (with automatic camel casing, similar to externc):
var myModule = require("my-module");
