Summary:
Error # 1034
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. I am trying to use open method and select methods on Flex Tree, They throw me a run time error Error#1034 and some other instances it gives some random nos. I just upgraded the automation package from Adobe website which has lot of new Methods for Tree and DataGrids, These Functions dont work with the build. I have another machine which has the old automation package and the open and select method works without any problem. Is there a Known issue as I tried uninstalling and reinstalling QTP software aswell but still no go.
java.version == 1.5.0_03 (Java 2+)
Actual Results: Run Time Error # 1034
Expected Results: Open and select method should work as desired
