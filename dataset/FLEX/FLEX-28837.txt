Summary:
Array parameter in JavaScript function invocation not passed as JavaScript Array
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create an html file with a JS function that tests whether the object in its parameter is an Array (eg, param instanceof Array).
2. Load that html file into an mx:HTML component.
3. Using the domWindow property of the mx:HTML component, make a call to JS function from step 1, passing as a parameter an AS3 Array (eg., [1,2,3]).
Actual Results:
The function evaluates the "instanceof Array" on the parameter as false.
Expected Results:
The function evaluates the "instanceof Array" on the parameter as true.
Workaround (if any):
Include a JS function in the html that parses either the AS3 Array parameter in the form that it is passed, or a json string, and have it return an JS Array object. JS Array objects generated in this way can then be passed to the original function (step 1) and will evaluate as true.
Notes:
The attached .fxp is an AIR project which includes an example of both the failure and the workaround (using json.js).
