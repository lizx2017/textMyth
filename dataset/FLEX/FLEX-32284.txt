Summary:
Embedded fonts not available in Module from Application. PieChart not showing labels.
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Embed a font in the Application and assign this font to the font-family of the Application with style, so the font is used application wide.
2. Trace inside the Application: Font.enumerateFonts(false). Notice the font is embedded.
3. Trace inside the Module: Font.enumerateFonts(false). Notice it is not embedded.
4. In the Module set a PieChart with "labelPosition" to "callout". Notice that no label is being displayed because it can't find the embedded font.
Actual Results:
Embedded font(s) not available
Expected Results:
Embedded font(s) available
Workaround (if any):
Embed the fonts in the specific Module and all works fine. Unfortunately the Module size will grow with this workaround, because it has to embed the font in the Application as well as in every Module.
NOTE: The behavior of not showing labels or text only happens to me with the PieChart so far. Still there is something weird going on and it may range much wider than just the PieChart.
