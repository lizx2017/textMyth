Summary:
AreaChart displays wrong value for low points
Description:
An AreaChart bug causes ones tooltips to display the same yField value for minFields.
I.e. for:
<mx:AreaSeries yField="TotalVariableCost" minField="TotalFixedCost" displayName="Total Cost">
It will show:
Total Cost
high: TotalVariableCost
low: TotalVariableCost
As opposed to:
Total Cost
high: TotalVariableCost
low: TotalFixedCost
(lines 2058 and 2083 of AreaSeries.as)
