Summary:
StageTexts containing a large amount of text do not dispatch "complete" events after their viewPorts are changed
Description:
Problem: If a StageText contains enough text so that it won't all fit in the StageText's viewPort, changing the StageText's viewPort will not result in a "complete" event being dispatched. Because there is no way for a client to ask a StageText if a "complete" event is pending, the client must keep track of changes to the StageText that should cause a "complete" event. Because of this inconsistency, tracking whether a "complete" event is pending becomes impossible.
Method:
1) Build and run the attached app on a small-screened device (or modify the app to put enough text in the StageText to overflow the viewPort on a large-screened device). The square in the upper-left changes color every time a "complete" event is received.
2) Tap on the square.
Result:
StageText changes size, but no "complete" event is received. The square doesn't change color.
Expected:
"complete" event received; square changes color.
