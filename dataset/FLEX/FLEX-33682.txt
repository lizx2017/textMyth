Summary:
Large Advanced Data Grid slow to resize
Description:
An ADG with headers and a reasonable number of columns (20 or so) is slow to resize.
Note Apache Flex 4.10 made some improvements over earlier version of the Apache Flex/Adobe Flex more can still be done.
Using Scout shows that a significant part of the problem is related to get columns (which does an array.splice) and then GC of all these copies of the columns array.
