This is due to some incorrect values entered into the 'apache-flex-sdk-installer-config.xml' file
The installer is checking against some CONSTANT values but the values actually entered into the XML are the ones being used as the labels displayed in the UI.
Updating the values to be the strings represented by the CONSTANTS will fix the problem.
