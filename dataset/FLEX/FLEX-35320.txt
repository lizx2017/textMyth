Summary:
[FlexJS] DataBinding Not Working When Host Changes
Description:
TitleBarView.mxml has this line:
 <js:Label id="titleLabel" text="
{ITitleBarModel(model).title}
" className="TitleBarTitle" >
But if I change the model to a tbModel where tbModel.title == "hi" I will not the label text is empty instead of it being 'hi'.
In other words, data binding only works if the host stays the same.
