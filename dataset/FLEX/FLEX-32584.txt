Summary:
Column Chart with SeriesSlide does not destroy old labels when data changes
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Setup a ColumnChart with SeriesSlide, and labelPosition="inside"
2. Add a timer to cause multiple showDataEffects and hideDataEffects
3. Watch in profiler as memory use increases
OR
Use the attached app, where I've extended ColumnSeries to demonstrate the problem, and showed (in comments) my current workaround.
Actual Results:
The Series' labelContainer grows huge
Expected Results:
labelContainer only contains current label set
Workaround (if any):
1. Extend ColumnSeries.
2. In updateDisplayList, remove excess labels from labelContainer
