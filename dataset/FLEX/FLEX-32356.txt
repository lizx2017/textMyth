Summary:
ADG drawCellItem() spends 30% of its time in isHeaderItemRenderer() due to poor guid lookup
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run performance profiler on ADG with at least 14 columns and enough rows to require vertical scrolling of at least 3 of four pages
2. Scroll the grid vertically using page down (click between thumb and down arrow of scroll bar) to cause all rows to be redrawn
3. Capture performance profile in profiler and analyze by drilling down to AdvancaedDataGrid.drawCellItem call and see approximatel 30% of the time is spend within AdvancedDataGrid.isHeaderItemRenderer(). This is caused by multiple calls to UIDUtil.getUID
Expected Results:
The test for isHeaderItemRenderer should take an insignificant amount of time.
Function in question:
override protected function isHeaderItemRenderer(item:IListItemRenderer):Boolean
{
var n:int = !orderedHeadersList ? 0 : orderedHeadersList.length;
for (var i:int = 0; i < n; i++)
{ if (UIDUtil.getUID(orderedHeadersList[i].headerItem) == UIDUtil.getUID(item)) return true; }
return false;
}
Observations:
1. Implementation loops through orderedHeadersList thereby the more columns in the ADG, the slower things get, even if columns are not visible or off screen.
2. Implementation uses redundant uid lookup via loop invariant "UIDUtil.getUID(item)"
Suggested fix:
1. Add isHeader to IListItemRender interface
2. Add property private var _isHeader:Boolean = false
3. Add public get and set accessors
4. Change AdvancedDataGrid.isHeaderItemRender(item) implementation to ' return item.isHeader;'
5. Change other ADG machinery whenever item renderers are created/set as header item renderers, to set 'renderer.isHeader = true;'
Notes:
Above suggested fix will avoid loop which gets slower with more grid columns and avoid repetetive and slow guid lookup. This should have a marked display performance improvement across the board since isHeaderItemRenderer is called in multiple places within the ADG display logic.
