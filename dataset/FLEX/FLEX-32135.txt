Summary:
BarSeries renders bars at wrong height when chart uses LogAxis
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
Import attached project. Build and run.
Actual Results:
Chart using log axis shows bars rendered with incorrect height
Expected Results:
Bar height should be correct
Workaround (if any):
I've worked around this by patching the BarSeries class to calculate the height of each bar individually before rendering and during hit testing. The approach of caching the bar height in _renderData won't work because with the LogAxis, each bar is a different height.
