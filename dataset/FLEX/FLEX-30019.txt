Summary:
While recording in FlexAdvancedDataGrid with QTP9.5 and IE7 and Flex3.0.0
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1.While recording we found, for Grids, it is considering as 'Window' in IE7, earlier it was 'Browser' in IE6.
For the same step, we recorded both in IE6 & IE7,
In IE6,
Browser("MealManager4® - Spec Search").FlexApplication("LoadScalesSearch").FlexAdvancedDataGrid("dg").FlexCheckBox("[ ] | 5005 | DL BC 25%").Click
In IE7,
Window("Windows Internet Explorer").FlexApplication("LoadScalesSearch").FlexAdvancedDataGrid("dg").FlexCheckBox("[ ] | 5005 | DL BC 25%").Click
2. So it is hectic for us to rework on Datadriver & Functions.
3. Can you guide us what to be done?
Actual Results:
In IE7:
Window("Windows Internet Explorer").FlexApplication("LoadScalesSearch").FlexAdvancedDataGrid("dg").FlexCheckBox("[ ] | 5005 | DL BC 25%").Click
Expected Results:
Browser("MealManager4® - Spec Search").FlexApplication("LoadScalesSearch").FlexAdvancedDataGrid("dg").FlexCheckBox("[ ] | 5005 | DL BC 25%").Click
