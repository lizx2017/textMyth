Summary:
Datatips show up in wrong position on negative bars and columns
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a BarChart or Column chart that has negative values
2. Mouse over a negative bar to bring up its datatip
Actual Results:
The datatip places itself on the origin (0). In other words, the datatip is always on top of a column and always to the right of a bar.
