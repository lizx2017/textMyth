Summary:
Auto code completion does not work inside script tags of component when using metadata event tags to talk to dispatch the event
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
<mx:Metadata>
[Event(name="homeComponent", type="flash.events.Event")]
</mx:Metadata>
Actual Results:
The step to reproduce will not throw an error and functions. When it is in the code, it will stop the script tag auto code completion from providing potential tag options
Script tags
<script>
Expected Results:
In Flex 2. This problem is not encountered and the auto completion will work inside the script tags.
Workaround (if any):
Removing
[Event(name="homeComponent", type="flash.events.Event")]
Will allow the auto completion to work in the script tags. So, I make my script edits and then have been uncommenting and then uncommenting once I am done.
