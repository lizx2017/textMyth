Summary:
baseAtZero="false" ignored when chart includes AreaSet with type="stacked"
Description:
Description:
Setting baseAtZero parameter to "false" on an axis is ignored, when the chart contains a few area charts configured as "stacked". In that case, axis behaves as if baseAtZero was set to "true", no matter what actual value has been set.
Steps to reproduce:
Run following code to see the bug
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<mx:Application xmlns:mx="http://www.adobe.com/2006/mxml" layout="vertical">
<mx:AreaChart dataProvider="{[
{s1:70, s2:40}
,
{s1:80, s2:50}
,
{s1:50, s2:60}
]}">
<mx:verticalAxis>
<mx:LinearAxis baseAtZero="false" />
</mx:verticalAxis>
<mx:series>
<mx:AreaSet type="stacked">
<mx:AreaSeries yField="s1" />
<mx:AreaSeries yField="s2" />
</mx:AreaSet>
</mx:series>
</mx:AreaChart>
</mx:Application>
Actual Results:
Y axis starts at 0
Expected Results:
Y axis should start around 50, as baseAtZero is set to false on Y axis, and 50 is the point with mimimum Y value
Workaround (if any):
None found.
