Summary:
Binding not working in Flex 4 but working in Flex 3
Description:
When upgrading our application from Flex 3 to Flex 4, we noticed some issues where bindings are no longer correctly executed. Attached is an isolated example and the sources (and the generated AS code) for a Flex 3 and a Flex 4 sample. The Flex 3 code works, while the Flex 4 code does not.
While comparing the generated code, I noticed that the bindings that are created are slightly different. In the Flex 3 example, a anonymous function is passed to handle the update of the binding, while in the Flex 4 example, a null value is passed. There are some other differences, but this was the one that caught my attention.
A workaround is to add the binding via BindingUtils.bindProperty() in the creationComplete handler of the component where the binding is defined.

Binding code:
<mx:CheckBox id="c"
label="Test"
selected="
{DataGridContainer(parent.parent.parent).checked}
"/>
Flex 3 generated:
new mx.binding.Binding(this,
function():Boolean
{ return (DataGridContainer(parent.parent.parent).checked); },
function(_sourceFunctionReturnValue:Boolean):void
{ c.selected = _sourceFunctionReturnValue; },
"c.selected");

Flex 4 generated:

new mx.binding.Binding(this,
function():Boolean
{ return (DataGridContainer(parent.parent.parent).checked); }
,
null,
"c.selected");
Workaround:
BindingUtils.bindProperty(c, "selected", DataGridContainer(parent.parent.parent), "checked");
