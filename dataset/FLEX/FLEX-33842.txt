Summary:
CXFormWithAlpha doesn't override toString() method, causing swfdump to ignore alpha effects
Description:
The java class CXFormWithAlpha doesn`t override the toString() method, causing swfdump to use the toString() method of base class CXForm and ignore the alpha multiplier and additive.
STR:
Create a swf with a movie clip (defineSprite) that has alpha color effect.
Use swfdump to convert the SWF file to an xml file.
Notice that only the alpha color effect is not mentionned on the placeobject that represent the movie clip with alpah color effect.
Known fix:
Just add this method to the class CXFormWithAlpha (modules/swfutils/src/java/flash/types/CXFormWithAlpha.java):
public String toString()
{
String base = super.toString();
return base + " " + alphaMultTerm + "a" + (alphaAddTerm>=0 ? "+" : "") + alphaAddTerm;
}
