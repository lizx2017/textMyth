Summary:
width of columns wrong after invalidateSeries if axis are not asigned to chart but to stacked columnset
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. run attached mxml/swf file
2. hit "mess up" button
Actual Results:
width for columns is falled back to daily but
Expected Results:
should be hourly in this case but could also be minutes or weeks, month...
Workaround (if any):
no workaround known. columnset canÂ´t be omnited as we need multiple indepandant stacks. asigning the axis to the chart it self is not an option as we need it to work with indepandant stacks.
the user will be able to set min/max for all axes individualy.
