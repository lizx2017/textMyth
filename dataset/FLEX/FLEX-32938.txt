Summary:
The AdvancedDataGrid control will not allow the removal of column (works oka for normal DataGrid)
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1.Create and populate an AdvancedDataGrid by binding it to a valueObject
2.Create and a copy the AdvancedDataGrid columns array to an ArrayCollection
3.Remove items from the ArrayCollection you copied to
4.Copy that modified ArrayCollection back using the toArray() method
Actual Results:
5.Using a debugger observer that the modified ArrayCollection is correct but
the AdvancedDataGrid columns array has not changed.
6 This same procedure for deleting columns works on the normal DataGrid.
Expected Results:
7. Should work the same as the DataGrid
Workaround (if any):
8.I have not found a work around, thatis, there seems to be no way to
delete a column from the AdvancedDataGrid using ActiveScript.
