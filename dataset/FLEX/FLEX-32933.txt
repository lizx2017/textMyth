Summary:
ADG throws exception when removing sorted column from multi-column sort
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a new Sort and assign multiple fields to it.
2. Set ADG's dataProvider's sort to this new Sort.
3. On the UI, CTRL+SHIFT+Click a column header to remove the column from the multi-column sort.
Actual Results:
Receive the following stack trace:
TypeError: Error #1009: Cannot access a property or method of a null object reference.
at mx.collections::Sort/internalCompare()[C:\autobuild\3.5.0\frameworks\projects\framework\src\mx\collections\Sort.as:831]
at mx.collections::Sort/findItem()[C:\autobuild\3.5.0\frameworks\projects\framework\src\mx\collections\Sort.as:527]
at mx.collections::ListCollectionView/getItemIndex()[C:\autobuild\3.5.0\frameworks\projects\framework\src\mx\collections\ListCollectionView.as:542]
at ListCollectionViewCursor/collectionEventHandler()[C:\autobuild\3.5.0\frameworks\projects\framework\src\mx\collections\ListCollectionView.as:2233]
This is caused by a discrepancy between the fields passed into 'internalCompare' and the local version, '_fields'.
The cause of the problem occurs on line 6768 of AdvancedDataGridBaseEx. The developer uses Array.splice to remove the SortField, but never updates fieldList (an internal variable set in the 'fields' setter of the Sort class)
Expected Results:
No error should be thrown and column should be removed from the sort order correctly.
Workaround (if any):
A manual invocation of the Sort.fields setter after the column has been removed from the sort would fix the problem, however, we are unable to do this before 'collection.refresh()' is called so there is currently no workaround.
