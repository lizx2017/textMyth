Summary:
Partially Occluded mobile TextInput/TextArea will overlap other UI when edited
Description:
There are two use cases for partial occlusions:
1) The TextInput is embedded in a scrollable form, and is scrolled so that only part of TextInput is visible
2) The TextInput partly overlap with anothe floating UI (palette, etc.)
In both cases, when the TI is edited, it will display completely, thus overlapping the UI around.
Note1: when the TI is not edited, it's correctly clipped
Note2: this is not to be confused with TI that are partly off-screen, which are handled correctly.
