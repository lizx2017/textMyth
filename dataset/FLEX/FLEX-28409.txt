Summary:
Buttons created in the Flash IDE don't bring over instance names for internal objects
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a button in the Flash IDE, and add dynamic TextFields or MovieClips with instance names etc.
2. Export as an SWF or SWC to use in a project
3. In the project, try to access the TextField/MovieClip from inside the SimpleButton.
Actual Results:
You can't find the object as their instance name has been replaced with the generic "instance###". Even though there's no keyframes in the Button in the Flash IDE, the up, down, over and hit states will report different instance names for the objects (i.e. the upstate will report "instance2", while the down state will report "instance 4" etc). The objects are being recreated in each state, and the properties aren't being properly copied over (such as instance name)
Expected Results:
The instance name of the objects should be carried over
Multiple instances of the objects (over the up, down etc states) shouldn't be created. If you have a SimpleButton with a dynamic TextField for a label (for localisation for example), then when you mouse over the button, the text will reset to whatever it was set in the IDE, requiring you to set it on all 4 instances.
Workaround (if any):
Change the SimpleButton to a MovieClip and control the playback yourself (kind of awkward and ignores the point of SimpleButtons in the first place)
Create a new MovieClip and separate the text from the SimpleButton. The SimpleButton is now just the bg of the "button", leaving the TextField separate (not always possible to do if you don't have access to the art, unnecessary objects, and awkward)
On creation, explore all the children of the SimpleButton, find the objects you need, and make the same changes to all of them (awkward and very specific; if you have 2 MovieClips inside the button, how do you tell which is which? size?)
Every one of these workarounds makes the SimpleButton class redundant. If adding a TextField or a MovieClip means I can't use the SimpleButton class, it makes no point to even start using it.
I've attached code showing this (including a flash file to generate the SWC).
Please don't just close this problem with a "check if it works in the latest SDK", as I don't have permission to reopen bugs (I've had 2 closed already that are still active)
