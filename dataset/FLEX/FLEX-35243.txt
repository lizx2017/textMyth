Summary:
Toggle button not removing toggleTextButton_Selected after selecting another button
Description:
In the FlexJSStore example if I select one of the navigation buttons, the navigation is performed correctly and the button state is selected to inplicate it's selected (css style "toggleTextButton_Selected"). If I select another button, this is too selected, unfortunately the style "toggleTextButton_Selected" isn't removed from the previously selected button.
