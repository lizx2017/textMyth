Summary:
[FlexJS, FalconJX] Unicode chars emitted differently in mac and windows
Description:
"\uE000" is emitted as a box on mac and a quetion mark on windows (tested on 2 machines, one of each OS). This means that using a regexp such as
/\uE000/g/
results in an error in windows because it evaluates to
/?/g which is invalid.
Workaround is to replace /\uE000/g/ with new RegExp("
" + "uE000", "g")
