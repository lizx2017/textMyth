Summary:
android screen orientation, menu and splashscreen rotate twice at startup [XOOM, tablet, autoorients]
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. make a simple mobile app using 4.5.1 sdk
2. autoOrients must be true
3. for extra bang, set the application's splashScreenImage
4. run app in android honeycomb on motorola xoom, holding tablet in portrait mode
Actual Results:
1. splash screen appears with android icons, but both are rotated to right (incorrect)
2. app auto orients to portrait mode, with bitmap incorrectly positioned
3. bitmap jumps to correct position
4. main window appears
5. customer asks what is wrong with app
Expected Results:
1. android menu and splash screen appear in portrait mode, correctly positioned
2. main window appears
Workaround (if any):
None so far.
I replaced the SplashScreen preloader but the problem is that the runtime is changing the orientation twice, unnecessarily. I even tried using a giant bitmap of round objects positioned at 0,0 but it looks bad. If there's a hook to prevent the initial incorrect orientation change, that would be great.
The app is very slow to start on some phones so I really want a splash screen
to entertain user rather than several seconds of inky blackness (i.e. user thinks "has app died?")
key xml settings:
<initialWindow>
<!-- <aspectRatio></aspectRatio> -->
<autoOrients>true</autoOrients>
</initialWindow>
