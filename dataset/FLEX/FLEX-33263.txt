Summary:
FocusOut in datagrid causes RTE if target.parent is null
Description:
during focusOutHandler, there is a condition that access target.parent.parent without checking if target.parent is null or not.
There is a quick fix by inverting the 2 last conditions so at line 5017 instead of having
if (target is IListItemRenderer && target.parent.parent == this && target.parent is ListBaseContentHolder)
we should have
if (target is IListItemRenderer && target.parent is ListBaseContentHolder && target.parent.parent == this)
this way, it will never throw an RTE because if target.parent is null, it will never evaluate the last portion.
