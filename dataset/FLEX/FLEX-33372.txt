Summary:
Windows 8 on-screen touch keyboard not displaying
Description:
On-screen touch keyboard is not being displayed for spark RichEditableText based text input components. It does get displayed when displayAsPassword property is set to true. It does get displayed for TextField based components.
Additionally, it would be desirable to control the keyboard using:
needsSoftKeyboard property
requestSoftKeyboard() function
These currently have no effect.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a Flex application that features s:TextInput, s:TextInput with displayAsPassword="true" and mx:TextInput
<mx:TextInput text="mx:TextInput" />
<s:TextInput text="s:TextInput" />
<s:TextInput text="s:TextInput password" displayAsPassword="true" />
2. Open this application in the Metro Internet Explorer on a touch-enabled Windows 8 PC/Tablet. You might need to edit the DebugDomain variable (see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-au/library/ie/jj193557%28v=vs.85%29.aspx)
3. Tap the mx:TextInput - on-screen keyboard shows
4. Tap the s:TextInput with displayAsPassword="true" - on-screen keyboard shows
5. Tap the s:TextInput - on-screen keyboard doesn't show
