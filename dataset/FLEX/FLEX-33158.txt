Summary:
addSortField method in the AdvancedDataGridEx works inconsistently
Description:
Please assume you have the ADG instance which has a data provider set to an ArrayCollection with custom compare function associated with the Sort object. The Sort object contains some fields, so that the ADG shows many sorting arrows.
If you ctrl+click header of an unsorted column, then ADG reuses the existing Sort object and adds the field to the collection, so that your custom comparison function is still in use. Next, if you click header of another column, so that only one column is sorted, then as the result, ADG will replace the custom Sort object with blank Sort object and the custom comparison function is lost.
Basic workaround:
coll.addEventListener("sortChanged", sortChangedHandler);
private function sortChangedHandler(event : Event) : void
{
if (coll.sort)
coll.sort.compareFunction = myCustomSortFunction;
}
