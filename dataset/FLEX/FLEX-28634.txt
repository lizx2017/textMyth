Summary:
SPUC SK Effects: Keyboard not activated intermittently when text input opens a callout
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Use the attached project
2. Select the "Open Callout" text input
3. Callout pops up and keyboard is activated.
4. Click "OK" and select "Open Callout" again.
Actual Results:
Very frequently, the callout opens but the soft keyboard does not get activated.
Expected Results:
Softkeyboard gets activated everytime the text input gets focus. This may be related to SDK-31637 but there appears to be a race condition.
Note - This always fails when automated with mustella.
Workaround (if any):
Try again!
