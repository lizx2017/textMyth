Summary:
AdvancedDataGrid: header textAlign style always center
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run attached swf, observe difference between DataGrid and AdvancedDataGrid. (demo derived from a sample app at http://flexpearls.blogspot.com/2007/07/customizing-headers-in-dgadg.html)
Best I know this worked in Flex 3 beta 2 (or at least the default horizontal text alignment for ADG column headers had been "left" ), I changed my DataGrid and DataGridColumn components to their Advanced counterparts when we were using Flex 3 beta 2 and this appeared to have worked; I never delivered that change and now that we've upgraded to Flex 3 beta 3 and I attempt to re-apply this change the column headers are all centered and I don't seem to be able to alter that, while I can with the DataGrid component in Flex 3 Beta 3.
The attached files provide a simple demonstration. Both the grids on the page are using the same styles applied to their headerStyleName attributes
Actual Results:
ADG's headers always centered
DG's headers horizontally aligned as expected as specified by their styles
Expected Results:
Both should be the same
