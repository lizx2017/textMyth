Summary:
LabelItemRenderer in SkinnablePopUpContainer flickers on fade in
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run the attached project and click the "Open PopUp" button
Actual Results:
The LabelItemRenderer's background color shows at alpha = 1 for a frame before fading in.
Expected Results:
The LabelItemRenderer should fade in correctly.
Workaround (if any):
In the attached project I have included a custom skin, but it is just a copy of the SkinnablePopUpContainerSkin with the fade-in duration set to 1500 instead of 150 so that the bug is easier to observe. The problem seems to be in the LabelItemRenderer.drawBackground() method. If I comment out the last line, it fades in correctly.
// opaqueBackground = opaqueBackgroundColor;
