Summary:
HTTP Service giving 2032 HTTP request errors in 14.15.0
Description:
I just installed 4.15.0 and tried to run a mobile app. It worked fine in the debugger but when it was installed on the device, either in debug or normal mode, it gave the HTTP request error. I switched back to 4.14.1 and it works fine with no other changes that switching from 20 to 19 in the namespace.
