Summary:
Maximum of LinearAxis is calculated based on the data of the last series instead of all series
Description:
Steps to reproduce (see example in attachment):
1. Define more than 1 series pointing to the same linear axis (log axis probably has the same problem)
2. Make sure that the first series has a higher maximum value than the second
Actual Results:
Columns/Bars of the first series are missing and the maximum of the axis is calculated based on the datafield of the last series
Expected Results:
Auto-calculate the maximum of the axis based on all series using this axis
Workaround (if any):
1. Do not encompass the series in a columnSet. When the columnSet is removed, the chart is rendered correctly.
2. Given by reporter:
Figure out the maximum value yourself by iterating through all data, series & axes.
The danger lies in the fact that things might work correctly (as long as the last series has the largest value). At some time however this might not be the case anymore and the application seems 'broken' without having done any change to the application itself.
