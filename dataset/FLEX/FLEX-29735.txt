Summary:
Automation causing QTP to register UI component events fired from application initialization
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
We're trying to record test cases for one of our applications. While it worked in flex 2, we haven't tried in flex 3 until now.
When the application is starting up QTP is registering actions as if the user was interacting with the application. After looking at the recording I can see that it's capturing change events firing from custom UI components during initialization. i.e. User has not even interacted with the app yet. This shouldn't be happening, no?
