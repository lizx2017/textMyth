Summary:
Changes to StageText appear on screen asynchronously, sometimes with significant delay
Description:
Problem: When a change is made to a StageText property that affects the way the StageText is displayed, that change is reflected on the display at some later time. The delay between the property change and the display change may be significant, making it difficult or impossible to synchronize changes to the StageText with changes in other UI.
Method:
1) Run the attached app on an Android tablet
Result:
The text on screen blinks when the bitmap of the StageText is swapped for the StageText itself. The blink is more pronounced in a Flex app running a transition (probably because more things are happening and taking more cpu cycles).
Expected:
No blink.
Workaround:
Extend the bitmap's visible time so it remains visible while the StageText is still invisible. Such a workaround works for this specific case, but other cases of delays in StageText's visual changes may not have such workarounds.
