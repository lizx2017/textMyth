Summary:
When selecting multiple cells vertically, any cells scrolling out of sight are removed from the selected cell set
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
(Using fully current Flex 3)
1. Create MX form with ADG
2. Create array for dataprovider with sufficient rows to scroll
3. Select a top cell
4. scroll down until top cell disappears
6. Holding down Shift key, click a bottom cell.
Actual Results:
Looks ok, but scroll back up and none of the hidden cells are highlighted any longer. They have been removed from the selected cell array, too. Only the cells actually visible at the time the second select is selected (with shif-click) remain selected.
Expected Results:
All cells found from top to bottom as selected.
Workaround (if any):
None.
