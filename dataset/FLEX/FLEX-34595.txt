Summary:
createChildren not called after setting the mxmlContent of a group
Description:
Set the public property "mxmlContent" of a spark group twice.
The first time, the content will change. Not for the second.
Because, the property "createChildrenCalled" is set to "true" the first time.
This will not validate the content graphics at the second time (with the invocation of "createChildren" method).
