Summary:
Header navigation with lockedColumns doesnt go beyond the lockedColumn boundary
Description:
Reproduction:
1. Compile and run the bugfile (lockedColumnCount set to 2).
2. Move the horizontalscrollbar thumb forwards.
3. Set the ADG to be non-editable and using the Up ARROW key highlight the first column header.
4. Navigate across the headers using the RIGHT ARROW key.
Actual Results: Header navigation doesnt occur across the lockedColumn boundaries.
Expected Results: Header navigation should work as expected
NOTE: When the horizontalscrollbar is in the default starting position, header navigation works across the lockedColumn boundaries.
