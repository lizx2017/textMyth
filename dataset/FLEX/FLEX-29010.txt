Summary:
Issue with multibitrate streaming (publishing side)
Description:
I have tried to publish a webcam source to Flash Media Server as two netstreams with different
bitrates(28Kbps and 128Kbps).But I am getting both the netstreams in same bitrate(128Kbps).
Steps to reproduce:
1.Create two camera objects (cam1,cam2)
2.Attach same camera device to both camera objects
cam1=Camera.getCamera("0");
cam2=Camera.getCamera("0");
3.Set different bandwidth values to the camera objects
cam1.setQuality(28672, 80); //28Kbps
cam1.setMode(320,240,15);
cam2.setQuality(131072, 90); //128Kbps
cam2.setMode(640,480,25);
4.Create two netstream objects(ns1,ns2) and attach to a netconnection
5.Attach cam1 to ns1 & cam2 to ns2
ns1.attachCamera(cam1);
ns2.attachCamera(cam2);
6.Publish both the streams
ns1.publish("myStream1");
ns2.publish("myStream2");
Actual Result: Two streams with same bandwidth(128Kbps,the last one we set to the camera object).
Expected Result: Two streams with different bandwidth (28Kbps & 128Kbps)
