Summary:
[Mirroring] When layoutDirection is 'rtl', image of the chart item which is being dragged is seen away from mouse pointer
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a flex project with 4.1.0.14922 sdk
2. Copy the attached mxml file (dragDropData.mxml) to the project
3. Compile and run the app
4. In the app, drag a chart item
Actual Results: When we click on a item (like pie widget or column) and drag, the image of the chart item is shown far away from the mouse pointer
Expected Results: Image of the chart item should be at the place where mouse pointer is, so that user gets a feel as if he is dragging the chart item with his mouse pointer.
