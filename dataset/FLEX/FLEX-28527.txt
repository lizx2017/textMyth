Summary:
when splitViewNavigator as children of TabbedViewNavigatorApplication, on launch, tabBar is visible even with tabBarVisible= false, and it gets hidden only after transitioning back to the first View
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. launch VTTestForSplitViewNavInTabbedApp.mxml
2. look at the tab1 for the first splitViewNavigator. its visible.
3. execute some transition within the tab1 navigator.
4. click 'back' button.
Actual Results:
Tabbar is invisible for both tab1(this is correct) and tab2 (this is wrong). but then if you run some transition, it starts to appear.
Expected Results:
The tabBar should be invisible all the time only for the specified views (where tabBarVisible="false" is set), and the view transition should not affect its visibility.
