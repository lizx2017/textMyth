Summary:
Poor GroupingCollection performance
Description:
The performance of the GroupingCollection is abysmal.
The attached slowgrouping.mxml builds a 32K row table of data with random values and then builds a simple grid using GroupingCollection from this data source. Executing this 32K rows takes 12.3 seconds to run on my (Intel Duo 1.8hz) laptop. See screenshot-1.jpg
12.3 seconds!!!! That means grouping process can only group about a 2500 rows per second.
By contrast, I coded up my own code see fastgrouping.mxml. Using a general approach viz nested simple objects to create a HierarchicalData in around 80ms. I stress again: orders of magnitude faster than the built in GroupingCollection. See fastgrouping-shot2.jpg
Further, once the built GroupingCollection instance is assigned as the data provider for the ADG, it takes a further 10-15 seconds per displayed group row to show.
Essentially, the GroupingCollection as it currently stands is unusable except for trivial datasets. Which is a shame because it doesn't have to be.
I'm working with Flex Builder 3 Professional (release build 3.0.194161)
