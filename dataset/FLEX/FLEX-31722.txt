Summary:
AdvanceDataGrid.collapseAll is not firing an event
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. create an AdvancedDataGrid
2. call collapseAll() to collapse everything.
Actual Results:
You do not receive ITEM_CLOSE or ITEM_OPEN

You used to receive ITEM_OPEN. expandAll() is still sending this event. Thi is inconsitent and his a regression breaking our component.
