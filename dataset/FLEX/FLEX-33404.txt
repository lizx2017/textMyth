Summary:
Compile error with Apache Flex 4.9 and not Adobe 4.1
Description:
I'm trying to build a project that is fine with the Adobe 4.1A SDK using the Apache 4.9 SDK, but we have a Skin that says
<fx:Metadata>
[HostComponent("com.ev.global.view.components.Dashboard")]
</fx:Metadata>
Adding CDATA inside the Metadata doesn't appear to change things.
Attached is a reproducible test case - this compiles out of the box with the Adobe 4.1 compiler, but throws an error with the Apache 4.9 release.
