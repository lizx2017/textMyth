Summary:
CLONE -Chart bars with zero data are drawn (and have datatips) although they have no values.
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create stacked bar chart with 2 series.
2. Set the bars' stroke parameter to be with width>1 (so that the bars will have border).
2. In one of the stacked bars, enter real value for the first series and a 0 value for the 2nd series.
Actual Results:
The 0 bar's border is seen. Datatip is shown for this bar.
Expected Results:
It should not appear and should not have any datatips.
This happens only if the 2nd bar has 0 value. If the 1st bar has 0 value it isn't drawn (as it should).
See attached Stam.mxml to recreate the problem.
