Summary:
Strange behaviour on iOS when editable TextArea is below SoftKeyboard.
Description:
In our app we have a view where the SoftKeyboard would overlap a textarea.
(The view has a header, below on input and below another header and a
textarea - everthing inside a group).
When the SoftKeyboard overlaps a textarea on Andorid everything is as expected when clicking in the TextArea (the SoftKeyboard is on top of the textarea and below nothing changes).
On iOS when clicking in the TextArea the Actionbar disappears, the textarea is at the top of the screen and clicking outside the textarea won't change the focus.
When the TextArea is smaller and the SoftKeyboard won't overlap there is no
problem on iOS.
Tested on various Android Phones and iPhone7 (10.3.3) and iPhone4 and
iPadAir (don't know the versions).
Tested with Air 25 and Air 26.
