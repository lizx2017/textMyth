Summary:
IOS buttons does not look correct when disabled
Description:
My app has Spark buttons on it. Using Flex 14.0 & Air 16, on IOS the buttons no longer look like buttons:
1. There is no rounded rectangle around them
2. They no longer have a light grey background
3. They no longer go "dim" when they are disabled.
They look and work correctly on the AIR simulator on Windows.
