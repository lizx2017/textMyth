Summary:
Stack column chart shows labels incorrectly.
Description:
Summary:
As the attached screenshot(TestCaseResult.pdf), the stack column chart shows labels incorrectly if you show minus values in the chart component.
However, the symptom does not occur when you show plus values in the chart component.
I created the 2 sample programs to show good-case and bad-case.
"StackedChartBad.mxml"....The sample which reproduce the symptom.
"StackedChartOK.mxml"....The sample which does not reproduce the symptom (works gracefully).
The attached screenshot, "TestCaseResult.pdf", contains both good-case result and bad-case result.
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the "StackedChartBad.mxml" in the FlexBuilder3 and execute it.
As the sample program shows you, it just set minus numbers to data source and show them in the stack column chart.
2. Review the chart which is appeared in the sample program.
Expected Result:
All the labels were appeared at correct position.
Actual Result:
As the test case result, almost labels were appeared at incorrect position.
Please refer the attached screenshot "TestCaseResult.pdf".
