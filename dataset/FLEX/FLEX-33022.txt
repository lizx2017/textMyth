Summary:
Focus will be out of the swf application when holding down the Tab key on the AdvancedDataGrid
Description:

1. Run the attached ADGSample.mxml
2. Click the first cell in the AdvancedDataGrid with a mouse. Leave the mouse pointer on the row.
3. Press the "Tab key" down and hold the tab key to move the focus.

Focus will be out of the swf application. And then focus will be back to the dataGrid.
