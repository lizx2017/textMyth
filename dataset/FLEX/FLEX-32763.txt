Summary:
Drill down problem with line chart having two series
Description:
Hello,
We have a line chart that shows two line series. The chart also has a drill down. When a user clicks on the line chart then it will show the detail data for that clicked point. The client have reported an issue saying that they are unable to drill down on the second line series when the two lines coincide (i.e. the data value for that point is same for both the series).It appears that basically the series that has a higher z-index will overshadow the series with a lower z- index. Is there any way that allows the user to drill down into the selected series when the two series coincides. Also it would be help full if some one could point me to other ways of solving this problem. Attached image contains a screenshot of the Issue.
