Summary:
[FlexJS] First view in TabbedViewManager not laid out properly
Description:
1) Take the MobileTrader example.
2) Add a first view that contains an image set to fill in the screen
<myNs:Image width="100%" height="100%" source="http://www.lessons4living.com/images/penclchk.gif"/>
3) Image will not be shown
4) Add a dummy view as the first view (even a copy of view from step (2) will do).
5) This time image will be displayed and will be laid out to fill the screen, as expected.
