Summary:
Performance problem with bubble charts with large number of items
Description:
There are around 2000 bubbles in the chart. This app has feature of drawing rectangle on the chart to select, zoom or pan the map using the mouse. All code included. It seems like when a mouse is moved all the items in the chart are getting rendered. The performance is sluggish and response is slow.
Steps to reproduce:
Create a project with given files and run the app.
Actual Results:
as you move the mouse around in the chart area, the crosshair is drawn very slowly and the CPU goes to 100%. the app becomes unresponsive and unusable
Expected Results:
the app should be usable. Any workarounds to turn the rendering of the bubble chart off?. any other recommended ways to draw rectangles or doing pans on the charts?. The performance starts suffering with as little as 1000 items.
