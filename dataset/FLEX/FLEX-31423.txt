Summary:
Reassign of chart series does not rescale axises
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
Unzip ChartSliderTest.zip and add it as new Flex project in Flex 3 Beta builder.
1. Have two different datasources for the same chart.
2. Notice that initial assignment of datasource and series to the chart works well (let say maximum value of vertical axis is 1600000, and lines are rendered well, filling maximum of available space).
3. Select new set of data and reassign it to the chart by selecting it from, for example, combobox.
4. Notice that vertical axis with bigger values is rendered right (maximum is 8000000).
5. Select first dataset from combobox with small values. Notice: maximum has to be set back to 1600000. Instead it remains 8000000.
Actual Results:
Maximum value of vertical axis is old (big one, e.g. 8000000)
Expected Results:
maximum has to be lowered (set back to 1600000.)
Workaround (if any):
Set new maximum and minimum manually, or do not set series. (comment this line:
bigChart.series = chartLines
NO SUCH PROBLEM IN FLEX 2 !
