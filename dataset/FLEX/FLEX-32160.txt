Summary:
PlotSeries plots on baseline when it shouldn't
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1.Download plotissue.mxml and plotissue.xml and make sure the xml is in the bin directory in the ide environment. These files are in the attached zip file.
2.Run.
3.Notice issue.
Actual Results:
The issue is that the PlotSeries should only render one plot on the graph, it renders one correctly and then others appear at the baseline of the cartesian chart. These "other" ones do not have any coinciding xml to warrant a plot on the graph.
Interesting note: When I add 1 to each of the values in the xml then this issue does not appear, but can not have that as a workaround. (ex: So the value was 0.92, I made it 1.92) May be value base with code when the values of the collection is < n? (Just thinking out loud).
Expected Results:
One plot on the chart and no plots on the baseline.
