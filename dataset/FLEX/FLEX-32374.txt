Summary:
Chart's dataTipCalloutStroke is never used and is confused with calloutStroke
Description:
Chart has a style called dataTipCalloutStroke that the documentation says is "The Stroke to use to render the callout line from the data tip target to the tip."
There are a couple of lines of code that initializes this stroke, but none that actually use the stroke. Instead, the undocmented style "calloutStroke" is often used.
This is a very old bug, as Ely Greenfield referred to it in a post on flexcoders titled 'Setting dataTipCalloutStroke="
{null}
" when dataTipMode="multiple"?' in May 2007. At that time, he said: "Took a peek at the code, and that looks to be an unfortunately bug on my part. Use 'calloutStroke' instead of 'dataTipCalloutStroke' style. You might have to set it programmatically".
It appears this bug has still not been fixed, nor could i find a bug report on it.
