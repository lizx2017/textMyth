Summary:
Using Embedded Fonts on AvancedDataGrid in Modules compiled with RSLs doesn't work!
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Import and run the attached project archive
2. When the Loader application loads the module, notice that on the first grid row, Label and Alias columns appear to be blank.
3. Now change the project properties Framework Linkage from "Runtime shared library" to "Merged into code" and rerun the Loader application.
4. This time all data is visable.
Actual Results:
Embedded fonts do not work on some AdvancedDataGrid columns (ie. non-custom renderers and non-summary columns) of modules compiled with RSL linkage.
Expected Results:
Embedded fonts should work.
