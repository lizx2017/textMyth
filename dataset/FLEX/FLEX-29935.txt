1. Create a new Air project and copy the attched mxml file 'main.mxml'
2. include the automation swcs and include the src folder for AIR.
3. Copy the swf 'loader1.swf' to a server (localhost or any other webserver, so that it is in a different security domain)
4. Start QTP
5. Run the AIR app and it will load the loader1.swf on clicking on Test button.
