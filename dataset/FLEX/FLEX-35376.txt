Summary:
Desktop application created for Windows is crashing unexpectedly
Description:
We have an air application that supports multiple instances (can run multiple windows app). Recently we are experiencing a crashing issue (Please see attached file). When trying to test in other OS like Windows 10 pro, its working fine. But for some like Windows 10 Home it will crash. I have also tested running the app in Mac OS and it is working fine. 
We can replicate the issue if we are going to run multiple instances of the app, then we login on both instances, then do some parallel transactions on both instances until we get the error at some point. 
  We have also tried running in debug mode but I cannot replicate any null exception issue and it will just show the not responding issue. SO it's really hard right now to pin point where the issue is and what is causing the issue. Maybe you can help us give some more info on where and why this is happening. Is this a system issue? IS this something in the code ?
