Summary:
Charting axis styles must be applied to both chart and axis renderer to function
Description:
Please examine the attached FXP file. From my understanding, styles should be able to be applied to chart axes in two places: on the chart ("verticalAxesStyleNames" for example) and on the AxisRenderer object's styleName property.
In order to style a vertical axis to not display tick marks, the style must be set in BOTH places. Removing either causes the style to not be set.
My style:
.ticklessAxis {
tickPlacement:none;
}
My code:
<mx:AreaChart id="Areachart" color="0x323232" height="100%"
showDataTips="true" dataProvider="
{expensesAC}
" verticalAxisStyleNames="
{['ticklessAxis']}
">
<mx:verticalAxis>
<mx:LinearAxis id="yAxis"/>
</mx:verticalAxis>
<mx:verticalAxisRenderers>
<fx:Array>
<mx:AxisRenderer
axis="
{yAxis}
"
styleName="ticklessAxis"
/>
</fx:Array>
</mx:verticalAxisRenderers>
The workaround is to set the style name in both places. It's a pain but it works.
