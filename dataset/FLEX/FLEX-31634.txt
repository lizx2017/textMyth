Summary:
Should have preview for AxisRenderer and series (BarSeries, etc.)
Description:
I really wanted to reopen FLEXDMV-1155 and FLEXDMV-1156, but I'll be nice and file this as a new bug...
Steps to reproduce:
1. Add a CSS file to your Flex Builder project
2. Create style rules for AxisRenderer{} and BarSeries {}
3. In Design View, adjust some of the charting-specific styles
Actual Results:
There is no visual preview of axes or a BarChart. You have no way to tell what the effect of your change looks like.
Expected Results:
AxisRenderer should show a chart (doesn't matter what type) with the current styles applied to its AxisRenderer
BarSeries should show a BarChart containing dummy data, with the current styles applied to the dummy data's BarSeries
Likewise for other "*Series" classes
Workaround (if any):
Apply your stylesheet to an MXML file. Add a chart to the MXML file and attach your styles to it. Also attach some dummy data to the chart. Then, each time you make a CSS change: save the CSS file, rebuild, and run your app. That's a lot of extra steps!
