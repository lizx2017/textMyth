Summary:
DateTimeAxis wrongly inverts Labels when DataUnit == months
Description:
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a flex project in flex 4, with sdk 4.0.0.13895
2. Copy the code from the attached mxml file, DateTimeAxisLabel.mxml
3. Run the project.
Actual Results: When we set the dataUnits="months", the axis labels are inverted.
i.e., in the current example, starts from 12th month, next label is 11th month, next is 10th and so on.
Expected Results: axis labels should not be inverted.
Note from the customer who logged the bug:
-------------------------------------------
The error is easily visible in the source code (SDK 4.0.0.13895).
See DateTimeAxis.as > method buildLabelCache > case „months":
While it seems to be implemented correctly in the if-branch (if (disabledDays || disabledRanges)), in the else-branch the code („push") is the same for inverted and nnot-inverted. Seems to be a copy-and-paste error.
So, if we use same disabledDays or disabledRanges but not in the other (more straightforward) case.
