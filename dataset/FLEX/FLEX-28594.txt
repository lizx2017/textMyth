Summary:
Showing a ViewNavigator in a callout while the navigator is transitioning to a View with StageText causes a crash on iOS
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Import and run the attached fxp on an iOS device (i used an iPad)
2. Press the Play Transition button
3. During the animation, press the "Callout" button in the right ViewNavigator
Actual Results:
The application exits
Expected Results:
The left navigator should appear in the Callout and no crash should occur
This seems to only occur on iOS devices. In the attached application, if you uncheck the "Use StageText View" button, the app will transition to a view that doesn't have stage text. No crash happens in this configuration. Running this test with the latest megahero release and AIR 3.1.0.448.
Workaround (if any):
Remove the TextInput and TextArea controls from the incoming View
