Summary:
[FlexJS] Container With ScrollingViewport Don't Resize When Element is Removed (HTML)
Description:
In this app:
https://paste.apache.org/5EYr
When clicking on remove, you expect outerContainer to resize to 0,0. In reality it remains the same size.
Probably due to
ScrollingViewport.layoutViewportAfterContentLayout() not calling super().
