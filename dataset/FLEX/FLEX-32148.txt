Summary:
beginFill() on a data canvas produces a "leaked" shape.
Description:
i might be seeing a bug with beginFill() on a data canvas. the following snippet produces a "leaked" shape:
endPoint=findEndPoint("UV",x,y);
uvCanvas.lineStyle(1,0xCCCCCC,.75,true);
uvCanvas.drawCircle(x,y,7)
uvCanvas.moveTo(x,y);
uvCanvas.lineTo(endPoint.x,endPoint.y);
uvCanvas.beginFill(0xCCCCCC,0.5);
uvCanvas.drawCircle(x,y,2);
uvCanvas.endFill();
Actual Results:
have a look at: http://www.sustainablegis.com/projects/git/dataCanvas.jpg for an example of the "leaked" shape.
if i push the fill bits to the beginning of that snippet, the leaked shape appears but lags behind one annotation, see
http://www.sustainablegis.com/projects/git/moreDataCanvas.jpg for example.
btw using/not using endFill() doesn't seem to effect this.
Workaround (if any):
rearranging the code to this:
uvCanvas.lineStyle(1,0xCCCCCC,.75,true);
uvCanvas.drawCircle(x,y,7)
uvCanvas.beginFill(0xCCCCCC,0.5);
uvCanvas.drawCircle(x,y,2);
uvCanvas.endFill();
seems to workaround that "leaked" shape.
