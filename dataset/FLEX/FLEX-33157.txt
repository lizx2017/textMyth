Summary:
Sort class: _fields and fieldList variables can be out of sync
Description:
NOTE: the issue exists in both, mx and spark Sort classes.
Sort.findItem function is not able to configure search criteria and skips a block of code due to outdated fieldList variable. It often happens when the user sorts the AdvancedDataGrid by clicking on a certain column header. In the shortest scenario you can reproduce it (without AdvancedDataGrid) as follows:
1. create Sort object and assign an empty array of SortField objects to it
-> _fields and fieldList are both empty
2. add SortField object directly to the array
-> _fields length is 1, BUT fieldList length is 0 (BUG) which disallows findItem() operation to configure search criteria
