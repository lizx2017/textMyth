Summary:
Tool tip doesn't inherit the direction and layoutDirection styles of its parent target component
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Copy the attached zip or fxp file.
2. Run the app ToolTipTest1.mxml.
3. Mouse over the TextArea, TextInput and the last TextArea then look at the text in the tooltip.
Actual Results:
For TextArea(default), it shows the default direction and layoutDirection for both the target component(TextArea) and the tooltip, i.e. ltr.
For TextInput(setting direction and layoutDirection via type selector), it shows direction and layoutDirection for the target component(TextInput) is rtl but for the tooltip, it's ltr.
For 2nd TextArea(setting direction and layoutDirection via class selector), it shows direction and layoutDirection for the target component(TextArea) is rtl but for the tooltip, it's ltr.
Expected Results: According to Max's command in the testplan, "ToolTip will inherit the layoutDirection of its parent target component.". So in this case, I think it should show rtl for both the target component and tooltip for TextInput and the 2nd TextArea.
