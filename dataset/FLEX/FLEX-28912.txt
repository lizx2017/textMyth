Summary:
TextTest hangs or crashes in the TextInput test on iOS
Description:
Found in CL 23151, last good run was 23144
Steps to reproduce:
1. On iOS, install either of these 2 iPAs:
\\fbapps.corp.adobe.com\rebecca\TextTest\TextTest-debug.ipa
\\fbapps.corp.adobe.com\rebecca\TextTest\TextTest-release.ipa
2. Launch the app
Actual Results:
The relase version hangs on the third test, which is the TextInput test. The debug version just crashes - the app vanishes. No RTE is thrown
Expected Results:
No crash
Additional Info:
Source for the app is in SVN frameworks/tests/performance/mobile/TextTest
This isn't a runtime/AOT issue - happens with the runtime currently checked in (479) and with today's air build (482)
