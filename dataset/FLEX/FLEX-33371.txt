Summary:
On Android, changing orientation fires Event.DEACTIVATE and FlexEvent.VIEW_DEACTIVATE events
Description:
Orientation changes on Android devices always fire the following events in this order:
ViewNavigatorEvent.VIEW_DEACTIVATE
Event.DEACTIVATE
StageOrientationEvent.ORIENTATION_CHANGE
The first two events are a defect. They must not fire simply because the user changed the orientation of the phone.
The result of this defect is that we cannot do two very important things:
1. Use view state changes to hide/show layouts, using includeIn property on containers and components. On Android, components that are not included for a given state are destroyed yet they have state we want to maintain which is why we don't change Views.
2. We cannot know when the user navigates away from our application, for example to press the Home key. We have certain cleanup we must do in our complex connected app that streams FMS data, etc., and cannot keep sockets open for hours or days.
On iOS, this is not a problem. Only Android has this bug and it's blocking us from releasing our product on Android. iOS does not have this defect.
