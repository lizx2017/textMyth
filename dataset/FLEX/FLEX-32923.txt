Summary:
The position of the Area chart is moved when Legend component is used.
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a new Flex project.
2. Add an AreaChart component to the project and set the data for it.
3. Add a Legend component for the AreaChart.
4. Run the project.
Actual Results:
The chart is displaced by a small amount when the legend component is used in comparison to the Legend used in the previous 3.5 SDK.
