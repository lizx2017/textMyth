Summary:
expected build.xml file missing from Linux binary tarball apache-flex-sdk-4.13.0-bin.tar.gz
Description:
This page:
http://flex.apache.org/download-binaries.html
has a link to a binary download for Linux:
http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/flex/4.13.0/binaries/apache-flex-sdk-4.13.0-bin.tar.gz
In the README instructions, the user is instructed to run "ant framework-rsls" in the untarred directory, direct quote:
*****************************************
Additionally, you will need to build the RSLS for the SDK before you run the
batch files.
cd <flex.dir>
ant frameworks-rsls
*******************************************
However, there is no build.xml file in this directory.
There is a build.xml file in the source distribution:
http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/flex/4.13.0/apache-flex-sdk-4.13.0-src.tar.gz
The source distribution's build.xml file does contain a framework-rsls target. Is using this file a workaround?
