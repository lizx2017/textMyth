Summary:
SelectedIndices order is messed up
Description:
The order of the existing selected indices is reversed each time a item is selected or deselected.
In spark.components.list.as, the function calculateSelectedIndices at line 1646, the loop is using splice to rebuild the selected indices. This is reversing the order of the previously selected indices before adding the new item. The loop should be using push to preserve the original order.
