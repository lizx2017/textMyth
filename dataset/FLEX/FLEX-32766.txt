Summary:
ARLabelData Leading to memory Leak
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Attached a sample application to reproduce the memory leak.
2. Profile the testGraph and you can see the ARLabelData instances are increasing and after that decreases but the memory keeps growing up.
Actual Results:
Once the number of instances (not cumulative) are coming down the memory must come down but the memory is still growing up. Also manually triggered the GC but no help.
Expected Results:
Once the number of instances of ARLabelData drops the memory must also drop.
