Summary:
Significant view transition performance regression on iPad.
Description:
There is a significant view transition performance drop on iOS (iPad and iPod) that was introduced in build 4.5.2.21954 + 3.0.0.375 (8/12/11), and that has gotten worse over time.
Saved comparison dashboards are broken, so I have attached a screen grab of the comparison to today's build.
