Summary:
HaloDefaults.findStyleDeclaration doesn't go through styleManager chains correctly
Description:
When the requested style declaration is not found on the provided styleManager, HaloDefaults.findStyleDeclarations tries to loop trough the styleManager chain, but looks for the style declaration on the same styleManager instead of the parent styleManager.
If the style declaration is not on the provided styleManager, null is always returned. -> problem when using modules!
