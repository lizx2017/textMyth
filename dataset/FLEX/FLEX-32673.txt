Summary:
CartesianDataCanvas failes to render if it crosses the charting boundaries.
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Add a CartesianDataCanvas item in a chart (a rectangle was added in this case)
2. Adjust the axis boundaries so that the added item is spilling over any chart boudaries.
Actual Results:
It is not rendered.
Expected Results:
It should be rendered as truncated.
Workaround (if any):
Need to readjust the chart item size so that the ending boundary values coincide with the charting boundaries (such pain).
In fact, the chart line items behave like this by default where the line segment is not drawn if the line segment is crossing any chart boundaries.
However, disabling filterCache method of the flex chart (http://cookbooks.adobe.com/post_Disable_filtering_of_Cartesian_chart_data_by_axis-13088.html) overcomes this.
It appears that CartesianDataCanvas does not work as other chart items behave in this regard.
