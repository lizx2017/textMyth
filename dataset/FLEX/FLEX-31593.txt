Summary:
removing ADG columns doesn't redraw correctly
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create an ADG with some columns (grouped or not)
2. remove a column
Actual Results:
If the columns are not grouped, phantom columns remain, both in spacing and their lingering column background. If the columns are grouped, the spacing is fine, but the background still linger.
Expected Results:
the column, both spacing-wise and it's background color should no longer exist after removing.
Workaround (if any):
none.
I have attached a simple MXML application that illustrates the symptoms in both cases. The background issues are easier to see with a semi-transparent background (so you can see stacking), but for the sake of simplicity, I didn't include a subclassed ADG with that feature.
