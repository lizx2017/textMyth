Summary:
Clicking on a column group sets the sort on an adjascent column
Description:
Reproduction:
1. Compile and run the bugfile.
2. Click on a column group header ( say the "Group" header ).
Actual Results:
1. The adjascent column "Company" is sorted.
2. Moving the mouse over the sorted column header makes the highlight flicker endlessly.
Expected Results: Clicking on the column group header should not sort any column and highlight should work sensibly.
