Summary:
Using a combobox as an itemEditor in AdvancedDataGrid causes memory leak
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Using the attached example project, profile the application and tab between columns of the data grid.
You'll want to uncheck the "add processing" check box in the application â€“ I used this as a sample app for another issue, but it demonstrated the memory leak well enough for use in here as well.
Actual Results:
Notice that the ADGItemEditorFocusIssue_inlineComponent1 & 3 counts never (or seldom) decrement. These are for columns 3 & 8 which use plain ComboBoxes for itemEditors.
Expected Results
All item editor instances should clean up properly.
