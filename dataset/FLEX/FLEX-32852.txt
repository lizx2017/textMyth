Summary:
Chart label text and other UI component labels disappear randomly with the when use flash text engine in mx is enabled
Description:
We recently switched to flash player 10.1 and are seeing an issue which we do not see with flash player 10.0. Several of the text on the labels randomly disappear. The text re-appears when we we hover the mouse over these controls.
The text disappears from tab bars, tree labels, grid entries. So the symptom is application wide and not restricted to any one control in our UI. Our customers have started upgrading to Flash 10.1 and are seeing this issue. We need to fix this ASAP.
This happens when we have the "Use Flash Text engine in mx components" enabled in the flex compiler options.
Browser: Firefox or IE
Steps to reproduce:
1. Please see the attached flex sample app. Make sure you have the "Use Flash Text engine in mx components" enabled in the flex compiler options.
This is a very simple flex application that reproduces the repainting issue using Flash Player 10.1.
When you first bring up the application a data grid and chart will be displayed correctly.
The following app shows the problem when you mouse over the rows in the data grid, the labels on the column chart start to disappear .
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<mx:Application
xmlns:mx="http://www.adobe.com/2006/mxml"
>
<mx:Script><![CDATA[
import mx.collections.ArrayCollection;
[Bindable]
public var expenses:ArrayCollection = new ArrayCollection([
{Month:"Jan", Profit:2000, Expenses:1500}
,
{Month:"Feb", Profit:1000, Expenses:200}
,
{Month:"Mar", Profit:1500, Expenses:500}
]);
]]
></mx:Script>
<mx:HBox height="100%" width="100%">
<mx:DataGrid >
<mx:ArrayCollection>
<mx:Object Name="Moodle" Type="LMSWare" />
<mx:Object Name="PageFlakes" Type="Webtop service" />
<mx:Object Name="Drupal" Type="Portalware" />
<mx:Object Name="MediaWiki" Type="Portalware" />
</mx:ArrayCollection>
<mx:columns>
<mx:DataGridColumn dataField="Name"/>
<mx:DataGridColumn dataField="Type"/>
</mx:columns>
</mx:DataGrid>
<mx:ColumnChart id="chart" dataProvider="
{expenses}" width="100%" height="100%" >
<mx:horizontalAxis>
<mx:CategoryAxis
dataProvider="{expenses}
"
categoryField="Month"
/>
</mx:horizontalAxis>
<mx:series>
<mx:ColumnSeries
xField="Month"
yField="Profit"
displayName="Profit"
/>
<mx:ColumnSeries
xField="Month"
yField="Expenses"
displayName="Expenses"
/>
</mx:series>
</mx:ColumnChart>
</mx:HBox>
</mx:Application>
2. Now you hover your mouse over the data grid and you will see the labels from the chart start to disappear.
This is using only standard flex components, canned data and no style sheet.
Actual Results: As mentioned the labels, tab labels, data grid entries disappear randomly.
Expected Results: No text should disappear.
Workaround (if any): We had to disable the "Use Flash Text Engine in MX components". However this led to losing out on the use of embedded fonts and label rotation for our charts.
See attached screen shots. One of them shows the labels missing.
