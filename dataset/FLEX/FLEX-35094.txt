Issue with emoji's using TextArea and RichText on Android and iOS
Description:
I am currently using TextArea with the following skin spark.skins.mobile.StageTextAreaSkin when getting input text from a user. The functionality is for a chat. The keyboard emojis appear fine in the TextArea, however, when the same exact data is copied over into a RichText (to indicate the message as sent), the emojis don't appear correctly. I have also tried using Label without much success. Is there a setting or something that needs to get done to get this to work properly or is this a bug?
I have attached a screenshot demonstrating the issue https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12805126/Screenshot_20160520-001147.png
