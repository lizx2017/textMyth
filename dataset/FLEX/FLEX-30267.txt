Summary:
Internet Explorer hangs when QTP-automated Flex application is open in IE popup window
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1.Create a simple Flex 3 application (<mx:Label text="Hi"/> as the only child of <mx:Application> is enough)
2.Compile it with automation libraries for QTP (automation.swc, automation_agent.swc, qtp.swc, automation_dmv.swc)
3.Make sure TEAFlexAgentIE add-on is enabled in IE.
4.Open the html page with embedded Flex application in IE modal popup window (by means of showModalDialog() JS function).
Actual Results: IE hangs (Does not refresh, does not respond to mouse/keyboard)
Expected Results: Flex application opens in a popup window. (It works this way if Flex app is compiled without automation libs or if TEAFlexAgentIE is disabled.)
