Summary:
NativeDragEvent doesn't seem to dispatch all Events.
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. build a DocumentClass with all the stuff in there
2. choose Export as AIR2.6 > ActionScript 3
3.
Actual Results:
Some the DisplayObject receives the NativeDragEvent.NATIVE_DRAG_ENTER but ignores all the others. The most important one for me being: NativeDragEvent.NATIVE_DRAG_DROP.
Expected Results:
It should at least 'trace' something, but it doesn't do anything
Workaround (if any):
Nothing I know of.
