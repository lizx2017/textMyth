Summary:
Spark GridItemEditor cannot edit nested properties
Description:
To reproduce:
<s:DataGrid editable="true">
<s:columns>
<s:ArrayList>
<s:GridColumn dataField="someProperty.nestedProperty" />
</s:ArrayList>
</s:columns>
</s:DataGrid>
This will throw a "no such property" error when the user tries to edit a cell, because GridItemEditor tries to access `_data[column.dataField]` in the `data` setter.
I filed it as a bug and not as an improvement, because it is inconsistent with `GridItemRenderer`'s behaviour, which does render the nested property correctly.
Note that the `save()` method is also affected: the item's property is accessed in the same way there.
