Summary:
Path to target for downloading thirdparty dependencies in modules is incorrect
Description:
The trunk currently fails to build because the name of the target for downloading thirdparty dependencies in the modules build file is incorrect. It was renamed from "downloads" to "thirdparty-downloads", but the call in the root build file was not updated.
See patch in attachment.
