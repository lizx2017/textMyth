Summary:
Simple ComboBox issues
Description:
The ComboBox rendering needs work;
Flash
Pressing the down arrow should open the popup, it doesn't.
The selection size of the Text in the renderer is larger then the selected background of the row.
The height of the popup does not fit the preferred size fo the 4 items in the list.
The popup is placed on top of the textinput, it should be placed below.
HTML
Just shows the Input element.
<js:ViewBase xmlns:fx="http://ns.adobe.com/mxml/2009"
             xmlns:js="library://ns.apache.org/flexjs/basic"
             initComplete="initialize()">

    <fx:Script><![CDATA[
        private function initialize():void
        {
            var dataProvider:Array = ["one", "two", "three", "four"];
            box1.dataProvider = dataProvider;
        }

        private function onChange():void
        {
            trace("Change");
        }
        ]]></fx:Script>

    <js:ComboBox id="box1" change="onChange()"/>
