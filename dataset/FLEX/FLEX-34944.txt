Summary:
GridItemRenderer overrides error tooltip
Description:
GridItemRenderer is a UIComponent, which can receive an errorString to signify that validation has failed on the data shown in the renderer. This is useful when the item editor (e.g. a dropdown list) disappears after the user chooses a value, and the application still needs a way to show the user they need to change the data.
However, when a Validator associated with that renderer fails the validation, the red tooltip that appears is either empty or shows the value in that cell (using the column's itemToDataTip() function). This happens because GridItemRenderer.toolTipShowHandler doesn't take account that the tooltip can be an error tooltip, which it shouldn't alter.
