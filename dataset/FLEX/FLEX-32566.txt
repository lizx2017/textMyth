Summary:
horizontalAxisStyleNames is ignored unless horizontalAxisRenderer is specified
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Add a bar chart (really - any CartesianChart)
2. Add a style definition for the horizontal or vertical axis through horizontalAxisStyleNames. Do not add axisRenderers.
3. Run
Actual Results:
styles are ignored
Expected Results:
axis should be styled according to the style definition
Workaround (if any):
add the axis renderer or use teh deprecated horizontalAxisStyleName
the reason seems to lie in CartesianChart's commitProperties() and updateMultipleAxesStyles(). If no axisRenderers are provided, commitProperties() creates a SINGLE axisRenderer. Later, in updateMultipleAxesStyles(), the style names are only applied if axisRenderers array is not a zero length - which it is since in commitProperties() the created renderer was not added to the array of axisRenderers.
