Summary:
After sorting on AdvancedDataGrid component unable to set selectedItem property.
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Populate a ADG. Dynamically add a new item and dynamically set the ADG.selectedItem to that new item; this works. Now sort a column on the ADG via the mouse. Again, dynamically add a new item and try to set the ADG.selectedItem property to that new item; it is set to null. In (briefly) looking at the code the internal "Collection" object w/n the ADG seems to get lost on the sort (and, thus, there is no Collection to set the selectedItem against). See the "setSelectedItem" method w/n the ADG after sorting and assigning this value to see what I mean.
Actual Results: Setting the selectedItem to a valid item w/n the ADG does nothing (gets set to null instead).
Expected Results: The selectedItem w/n the ADG should be set to the assigned value.
Workaround (if any): Not aware of any.
