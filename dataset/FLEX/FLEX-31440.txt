Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create an AdvancedDataGridEvent and specify values for all its constructor params that do not match their defaults
2. Clone it by calling the AdvancedDataGridEvent.clone
3.Compare all the properties
Actual Results:
These properties are not the same in both instances:

multiColumnSort
removeColumnFromSort
triggerEvent
Expected Results:
Both instances should have identical property values.
Workaround (if any):
Set the values afterwards.
