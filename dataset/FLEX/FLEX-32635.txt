Summary:
ITEM_ROLL_OVER event firing when mouse is over context menu in Flash Player 10.0.32
Description:
I have a feature that depends on ChartItemEvent.ITEM_ROLL_OVER to determine the data point on a chart. In Flash Player 10.0.22.87 this event does not fire when there's an active context menu in the chart, thus allowing me to capture the last data point to reference for the context menu. However, in the latest Flash Player 10.0.32 this event continues to fire when there's an active context menu up, and when I select a context menu item, the point of reference is actually the nearest point underneath the mouse at the time of the click.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run the attached example in Firefox.
2. Right click on a column and select the context menu option.
Actual Results:
The selected column is where the mouse is positioned after the left click on the context menu option.
Expected Results:
The selected column should be where the right click occurred (where the context menu is positioned).
Workaround (if any):
None known.
Notes:
I believe this issue may be limited to Google Chrome and Firefox 3+ version of the Flash Player only. This defect was not reproduced in Internet Explorer. See the attached example.
