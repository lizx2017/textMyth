Summary:
DropDownList inside a PopUpAnchor doesn't close when another DropDownList is selected
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
Run the attached code
Open the first DropDownList
Open the second DropDownList
Actual behaviour: the first DropDownList is not closed.
Expected behaviour: the first DropDownList is closed.
Notes:
this is how it usually works when the components are not inside a PopUpAnchor
it relates to the DropDownLists not receiving the FocusEvent.FOCUS_OUT event when the other one is clicked, as ought to; DropDownListBase.focusOutHandler() is never called, even when the user clicks outside the application, whereas for DropDownLists on the stage the function is called for both these scenarios.
If we wrap the HGroup inside a TitleWindow, all works as expected. That's because TitleWindow implements IFocusManagerContainer and, as described in PopUpManager, "If the class implements IFocusManagerContainer, the window will have its own FocusManager so that, if the user uses the TAB key to navigate between controls, only the controls in the window will be accessed."
There is code in to keep the DropDownList open if the click was made on another DropDownList. This was implemented as a fix for FLEX-34088.
