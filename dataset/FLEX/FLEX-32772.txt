Summary:
PieChart sizes are not in ratio. If two charts' width is 1:2 then width visually is not in the ratio 1:2 , its in 1:3 or 1:4
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run the attached sample.
2. The first Hbox contains two charts with width as 200 and 400 resp.
3. The Second Hbox contains two panels containing a chart each , with chart taking the 100% width of the panel, and panels' width as 200 and 400 resp.
Tried this with Flex 3.5 and FB 4 , shows the same issue in both .
Actual Results:
First HBox shows the Charts in ratio 1:3 [Incorrect]
Second HBox shows the Charts in ratio 1:2 [Correct]
Expected Results:
Both the Hboxes should have shown the charts in the same ratio i.e, 1:2 .
Workaround (if any):
I contained the chart in panel, that worked, but this is not possible to use each time, as excessive use of Panel would make the app heavy.
