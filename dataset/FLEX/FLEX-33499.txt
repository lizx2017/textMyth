Summary:
LoaderInfo not updated in HTMLLoader class
Description:
When creating a Window/NativeWindow with a scrollable HTML content inside, as described in the example at here: http://livedocs.adobe.com/flex/3/html/help.html?content=ScriptingHTMLContainer_8.html, and, when it was opened from 'createRootWindow()' method by override the HTMLHost class - its noticed that the newly created HTMLLoader class does not having an updated LoaderInfo object nor any event dispatched with the LoaderInfo object; where as it was expected to be updated since the HTMLLoader do works (changes location, dispatches Event.COMPLETE event etc.) fine. Is it supposed to be not being updated (LoaderInfo) when opens an HTML in the way described in the link? I think the LoaderInfo should also gets updated everytime.
