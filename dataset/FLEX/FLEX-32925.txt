Summary:
TabNavigator with creationPolicy="all" mess with AdvancedDataGridColumn.width
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. The sample used to reproduce the error are attached to this issue. Basically the structure is:
TabNavigator with creationPolicy="all"
Canvas
AdvancedDataGrid/DataGrid
AdvancedDataGridColumn/DataGridColumn with width=100
AdvancedDataGridColumn/DataGridColumn with width=100
AdvancedDataGridColumn/DataGridColumn
Canvas
AdvancedDataGrid/DataGrid
AdvancedDataGridColumn/DataGridColumn with width=100
AdvancedDataGridColumn/DataGridColumn with width=100
AdvancedDataGridColumn/DataGridColumn
2. When you run the application and selects any tab (except for the current selected on initialization), you can see that the width defined for the columns on this tab was not respected.
3. This only happens when creationPolicy is setted to all. In any other cases (auto or queued), the width for the columns are respected.
4. More tabs can be added but the result will be the same as only two.
Actual Results:
Column width not respected when used along TabNavigator and creationPolicy="all".
Expected Results:
That column width be respected independently of creationPolicy value.
Workaround (if any):
None except if you don't need creationPolicy="all", then you can change to auto or queued.
