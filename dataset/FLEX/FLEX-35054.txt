Summary:
js:Panel lost background colour in js:State change in HTML output
Description:
SDK: FlexJS 0.5.0
IDE: Flash Builder, Moonshine
My test application is consists of several states having one js:View component in each state. One state have a js:Panel which toggled it's visibility upon user interaction. When re-visiting the same state during an application cycle, opening js:Panel showing lost it's background colours.
Please, find herewith my attached test project source which describes the problem:
1. Run the application in HTML
2. The application consists of 3 js:State
3. In first state one should see a button labeled "Go Next Section" - this will change application to state 2
4. State 2 have one button labeled "Open Popup Panel"
5. Clicking on the above button make an in-page js:Panel visible=true. This also demonstrate another problem where showing Panel push any existing Container underneath it. Both existing Container and Panel are child of a Container class. If I understood correctly if no layout beads explicitly added a Container class works like fx:Group or mx:Canvas class. I wonder why showing up Panel making it's parent acting as vertical container instead!
6. Showing up Panel has two buttons - Close This, Continue. Close This will just toggle it's visibility where Continue button make it's visibility false and make the application move to it's next state (State 3)
7. State 3 has one button labeled "Go Previous Section" - this will make application return to State 2 which has the js:Panel
8. Click on "Open Popup Panel" once again - background colour should vanish, width became wrong and interaction not works.
Please, check.
