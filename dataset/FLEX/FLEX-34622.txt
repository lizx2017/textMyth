Summary:
IResourceManager.localeChain is not bindable
Description:
In IResourceManager there is several bindable functions. But direct binding to localeChaing property is not possible. [Bindable("change")] will fix that.
Workaround: copy IResourceManager to your project and add metadata:
[Bindable("change")]
function get localeChain():Array /* of String */;
