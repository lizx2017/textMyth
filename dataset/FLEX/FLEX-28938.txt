Summary:
~15-20% regression on iOS in the TransitionTests & SpViewNavTransitionTests
Description:
In SDK 4.6.0.23172 + Air 3.1.0.485, we've got about a 15-20% regression in most of our TransitionTests & SpViewNavTransitionTests. We're also seeing a smaller subset of tests with similar regressions in the RadioStations scrolling tests, particularly on iPAD. See the attached report.
Note: The TransionTests & SpViewTransitionTests have been offline on iOS for the past 4 days because of SDK-31979 because they were crashing, so it's not clear if this is an injection with the most recent changelist or runtime or from a few days past.
