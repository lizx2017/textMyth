Summary:
env.properties not used if mxmlc/compc/asdoc run from ant task or jar executed directly
Description:
If mxmlc, compc, asdoc, etc are run from the corresponding ant task (for example <mxmlc>) or directly from the jar then env.properties isn't used.
Related issue to [Flex-59] for the bat and script files but in that case it is possible to set the environment variables in the script using the values in env.properties if they aren't already set.
The mustella tests won't compile unless environment variables are set.
