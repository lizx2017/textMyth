Summary:
invalid datagrid.rowCount when accessed
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. create a datagrid in mxml.
2. request the rowCount on FlexEvent.CREATION_COMPLETE event (or anything before or after this function)
It changes the rowcount when data is inserted, but i want to retrieve data with the number of visible rows
Actual Results:
The default I always get back is 6 rows(excluding header).
Expected Results:
But the visual rowCount (listItem.Length) is 30 (in my application)
Workaround (if any):
1. Extend the DataGrid class
2. override the function updateDisplayList
3. place "setRowCount(listItems.length);" in the function
and voila, I got the correct rowCount.
