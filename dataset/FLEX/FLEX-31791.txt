Summary:
MXML completion does not take DefaultProperty into account
Description:
This bug was first reported under AdvancedDataGrid (FLEXDMV-1299), so
we'll use that as an example here.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Open an MXML file, create the ADG mxml syntax like this:
<mx:AdvancedDataGrid>
<mx:groupedColumns>
<mx:AdvancedDataGridColumnGroup headerText="foo">
</mx:AdvancedDataGridColumnGroup>
</mx:groupedColumns>
</mx:AdvancedDataGrid>
2. An ADGColumnGroup is just a bunch of ADGColumns - as expected, this
is the column grouping feature. So, let's try adding an ADGColumn
under this group:
<mx:AdvancedDataGrid>
<mx:groupedColumns>
<mx:AdvancedDataGridColumnGroup headerText="foo">
<
</mx:AdvancedDataGridColumnGroup>
</mx:groupedColumns>
</mx:AdvancedDataGrid>
3. Notice the 'less than' sign inside ADGColumnGroup. The completion
window should open up.
Actual Results: There is no ADGColumn in the list of completions.
The problem is that the 'children' property is the DefaultProperty
for ADGColumnGroup and within children, ADGColumn is a valid entry.
However, since FB doesn't seem to be taking the completions possible
for DefaultProperty here but only for the actual MXML tag above,
ADGColumn is not displayed in the list of completions.
Expected Results: There should be ADGColumn in the list of
completions.
Workaround (if any):
Put <mx:children> tag and within that tag, the ADGColumn tag is
properly displayed in the completion window.
