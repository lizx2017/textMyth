Summary:
AdvancedDataGrid selectedItem does not work properly when set in actionscript.
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Open the attached sample.
2. Click the Set Selected Index button.
3. Press the up and down arrow keys.
4. Selected highlight and focus moves up and down with arrow keys as it should.
5. Click the Set Selected Item button.
6. Press the up key. Nothing happens (It seems, the focus, not the highlight, moved to the header and thus only the down arrow will bring the focus into view, although the header does not show itself having the focus in this state).
7. Press the down arrow key and the focus moves to the first row and does not scroll from the selected item.
8. Press the up and down arrow keys and the focus now tracks with the highlight of the selected item.
Actual Results:
The focus jumps to the header and does not scroll from the selected item when the selectedItem is set in actionscript. The highlight remains on the selectedItem, but the focus does not.
Expected Results:
The selected item focus should move up and down with the selected item and track with the highlight on the selected item.
Workaround (if any):
Use selectedIndex to set the selected item.
