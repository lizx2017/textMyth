Summary:
Date bug in Safari
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a new Flex project.
2. add these two lines (to applicationComplete() for example):
var date:Date = new Date();
date.setFullYear(-2, 0, 1);
3. run the app in Safari.
Actual Results:
The app is hanging. When in debug mode (Flash Builder 4.5), the debugger does not give any feedback.
This happens with every negative date, when (date.fullYear + 2) % 4 == 0 (like -2, -6, -10, ...), date.month == 0 and date.date == 1.
It works fine in Firefox, and colleague tested it in Safari for Windows - without problems.
Expected Results:
At least I'd like to see an error message in the debugger. Of course it would be better, if the app would not hang at all.
