Summary:
Cannot interact with StylableStageText outside of pop-up when pop-up is active
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run the attached project (preferably on a tablet)
2. Choose "SPUC SoftKeyboard FPS Test"
3. Click on the TextInput with prompt "Open Callout"
4. Attempt to type
Actual Results:
One or zero characters appear when typing. It appears that the TextInput is a bitmap because the Callout is open.
Expected Results:
Only change StageText instances to bitmaps when they are clipped by a popup.
Workaround (if any):
Don't use modeless pop-ups and StageText simultaneously.
