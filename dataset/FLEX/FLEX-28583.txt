Summary:
Callout container not interacting correctly with the keyboard
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Compile and run the app CalloutKeyboard on a phone
2. Select the 'Open Callout container' button
3. After the Callout opens, try selecting a TextInput in the Callout. Nothing happens. The keyboard should open.
4. Close the Callout by pressing OK or Cancel in the Callout.
5. Reopen the Callout and select a TextInput - The keyboard opens as it should.
A second issue:
This app is compiled with Application.resizeForSoftKeyboard="false".
1. Select the TextInput labelled 'First Name6:' in the Callout.
2. The keyboard opens but overscrolls the Callout so there is a blank area under the TextInput. See the screenshot labelled over_scroll.png.
3. Now change the app to set Application.resizeForSoftKeyboard="true".
4. Select the TextInput labelled 'First Name6:' in the Callout.
5. The keyboard opens but does not scroll the Callout so you cannot see 'First Name6:'. See the screenshot labelled no_scroll.png.
