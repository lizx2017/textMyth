Summary:
Scrolling or collapsing/expanding the nodes in a fairly large and complex ADG causes a performance lag for the action to complete.
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create and ADG with approx. 100 columns with approx. 200 rows in a grouping collection that contains approx 30 groups.
2. Two columns should have style functions attached. (and item rendering has not been used)
3. Scroll or collapse/expand the nodes.
Actual Results:
it takes between 1/2 to 1 second for the action to complete.
Expected Results:
There should be no performance lag.
