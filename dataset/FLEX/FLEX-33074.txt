Summary:
Build script requires sh on Windows
Description:
There is a call to sh with automatically generated shell script that was used to untar the AIR archive. On Windows it wouldn't work and on Linux it would unpack with the permissions given to the user of the terminal, rather then the permissions given to Ant user (files created would be protected for Ant script later).
