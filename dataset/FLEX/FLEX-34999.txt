Summary:
Chart with large dataset hangs and the UI becomes irresponsive
Description:
Flex Version: 3.4
Component: Line chart.
Axis: Two linear Y-axis and x-axis as Date Time Axis.
Problem:
Irrespective of OS and browsers, the chart and flash stops responding while viewing chart with 1 full week of data that contains more than 3 line series. For each line series it has 10080 points(Since it is date time axis chart each minute have a data point and this is the maximum number of data samples for full week range).
Workaround we tried:
1. Tried not to load all the line series in the chart at the initial load. Instead enable/toggle one series at a timer using timer set to 10 seconds. The UI is responsive till 2-3 series enabled with full week of data points, after that the chart will start to respond slowly and when it comes to all the line series in the chart toggled on, the UI stops responding and sometime flash player crashes.
2. Break the large data set into two equal halves. Loaded the first half of the data in the chart and now chart is responding. But after that while loading the second half of the data to each line series using a timer set to 10 seconds the UI stops responding and again we see the same issue as we had with scenario 1.
3. Toggle off all the properties in the initial load and limited the user to enable a maximum of 2-3 line series at a time to view in the chart.
4. Suggested day mode in Chart, where in the chart is loaded with only single day's data points. Each line series will have 1440(Maximum number of sample per day for single property). In this scenario the chart is working as usual and we don't have performance issue.
