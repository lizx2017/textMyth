Summary:
Runtime error when using a chart in a module in an app that is also using charts
Description:
This is a regression in 4.6. It doesn't matter if the modules are Spark or not. Works fine in 4.5.1 and below.
See attached FB project.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create an app that uses a chart and create a module that also uses a chart.
Actual Results:
TypeError: Error #1009: Cannot access a property or method of a null object reference.
at mx.charts.chartClasses::ChartBase/initStyles()[E:\dev\4.y\frameworks\projects\charts\src\mx\charts\chartClasses\ChartBase.as:1862]
Expected Results:
No error and chart loads fine.
Workaround (if any):
Copy chart styles from module's parent styleManager into the module's own styleManager.
