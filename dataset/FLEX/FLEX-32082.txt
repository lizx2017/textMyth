Summary:
Axis scaling on Stacked Charts
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
Run the attached code
Actual Results:
When we change the dataProvider for a stacked bar/column chart, the range of values on the Linear Axis don't seem to change in the same scale as the data i
n the dataProvider thereby making the resultant chart very small and unreadable. About the application - we have two sets of data here - one ranging
from -10 to 148 and the other from 0 to 3.68 (small scale) When the button in the application is clicked, the dataProvider for both the Column Charts is updated but while the chart on the right (clustered that doesn't use a ColumnSet) updates the values on the Axis to reflect the current scale of the data in the dataProvider, the stacked chart on the left (that uses a ColumnSet) doesn't, thereby rendering the chart very small and hence very difficult to read. The problem is worse when the difference in the scale of value
s in the dataProvider is much larger.
Expected Results:
What we like to see is the same axis scaling behavior on the axis as the chart on the right.
Workaround (if any):
The workaround is to have an initializer for stackedMinimum to NaN in StackedSeries' stack method (just before the for loop).
You could subclass ColumnSet which is derived from StackedSeries and have your own method which does this (by copying the code) or just change the StackedSeries's stack function.
