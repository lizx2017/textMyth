Summary:
Spark Accordion: Event that is triggered on animation complete isn't implemented correctly
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create an Accordion with few Accordion contents.
2. Change the selected Accordion Content.
3. Wait for currentStateChange event.
Actual Results:
currentStateChange is fired once the animation is complete.
Right now the event gets fired from the resizeEffectEnd handler, which is not a very general way of doing it.
Expected Results:
A generic event needs to be fired on completion of animation.
