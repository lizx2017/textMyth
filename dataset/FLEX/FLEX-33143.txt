Summary:
Spark TextInput using Mobile skinClass: setting displayAsPassword to true impacts all other TextInput and breaks softKeyBoard (no more International keyboards)
Description:
Hello,
We have a mobile application that uses Flex 4.6 (Air 3.3) that is deployed on Android Tablets and IPad ones (IPad 1 & 2, IOS 5.1.1 9B296).
Users from Thailang / Korea are reporting a problem with the soft keyboard which does not propose the Thai or Korean keyboard while native application do propose it.
To be clear, on iPad you can configure more than one keyboard among which for example Thai or Korean keyboards.

I searched for some time, and finally came to a strange idea. I noticed my first TextInput fields had displayAsPassword set to true.
So I made a little test with:
1)<s:TextInput/>
and
2) <s:TextInput displayAsPassword="true" />
And BINGO, there is a bug:
1) If I first go to first field, International Keyboard appears
2) I go to second one, it disappears
3) I go back to first one, no more International Keyboard
Setting displayAsPassword="true" breaks soft keyboard.
