Summary:
itemToLabelWithoutFormatting and applyFormatting in ADGColumn should be protected so that derived classes can use them
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
Try to derive a new AS class from ADGColumn to override the itemToLabelWithoutFormatting function and use applyFormatting.
I was trying to do this to return properties of nested objects in the dataProvider.
Actual Results:
It is not posssible because they are private.
Expected Results:
The functions should have been protected.
Workaround (if any):
Use labelFunction but this requires to be used in every DG/ADG control instead of doing it in one place.
