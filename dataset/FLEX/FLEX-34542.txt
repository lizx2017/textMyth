Summary:
Touch KeayBoard does not appears on focusing textinput on Windows 8.1 in AIR app
Description:
Linked to the bug FLEX-33372.
If you make a project with textInput, and if you try to launch it on Windows pro 8.1 with a touch-screen, you wil see that the keyboard never appears.
It's a problem because If I want to see a keyboard, I Have to launch manually an executable (described here https://bugbase.adobe.com/index.cfm?event=bug&id=3824422 ), and the application does not resize with this solution.
