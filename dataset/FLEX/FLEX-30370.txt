Summary:
CLONE -Overriding FlexTextArea's Input method does not works in QTP
Description:
I am trying to select the existing text(if there is any) and input new text in the FlexTextArea using the Input method. It throws an error stating 'Object doesn't support this property or method: 'obj.Input'"MySet=obj.Input "'. I believe this is a valid method for the FlexTextArea class object. The SelectText method works fine but there is some problem with the Input method. Please help to resolve this.
Actual Results:
Values must be accepted in the FlexText Area
Expected Results:
The text should be inputtedinto the FlexTextArea field.
