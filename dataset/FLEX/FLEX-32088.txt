Summary:
headerWordWrap works incorrectly in AdvancedDataGrid
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create an AdvancedDataGrid with two columns. Set it's width.
2. Make the title of the first column short, so it could fit the column width. Make the title of the second column long, so it couldn't fit the column width.
3. Set headerWordWrap property of the AdvancedDataGrid to true.
Actual Results:
The title of the second column does not wrap. Only part of the title is shown. The only way to make the title wrapped is to resize the column to any size.
Expected Results:
All colum titles should be fully shown.
