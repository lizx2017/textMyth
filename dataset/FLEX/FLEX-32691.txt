Summary:
AdvancedDataGrid with showRoot set to false on a HiearchicalCollectionView
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create an AdvancedDataGrid, testData, and a HiearchicalCollectionView
2. Set showRoot to false on the HiearchicalCollectionView
3. Open a branch
Actual Results:
The branch children are displayed at the same depth (indentation) as their parent. The depth/indentation gets rendered correctly when showRoot is set to true. That is the same branch children will not be indented at the same level as their parent. Also, I reproduced this issue both on Mac OS 10.6 and Windows 7.
Expected Results:
The branch children should be indented some distance to the right of their parent. This does occur when showRoot == true, but does not function correctly when showRoot == false
Workaround (if any):
Have the annoying single root shown.
