Summary:
AdvancedDataGridGroupItemRenderer - commitProperties RTE
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create two Array's of columns where there is a column in each set that has a item renderer of type AdvancedDataGridGroupItemRenderer
2. Change the columns property on AdvancedDataGrid from one Array of columns to the second array.
Actual Results:
AdvancedDataGridGroupItemRenderer can throw a RTE because the column does not exist for the list data object associated to the renderer.
Expected Results:
RTE should not occur.
Workaround (if any):
Add null check to commitProperties to see if the column exists before extracting data from the column.
or Clear listData / data object on the renderer when columns change in the grid so you can not enter in to that block of code in commitProperties when the column does not exist.
