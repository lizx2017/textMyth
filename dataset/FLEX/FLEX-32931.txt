Summary:
Data gets lost from CartesianChart on reparenting and series changing.
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
Attached ColumnChartTest project is the way to reproduce this bug on ColumnChart as sample.
There are two buttons: "Reparent" - add/remove chart from stage, "Delete Series" - delete last series
Test 1
1. start ColumnChartTest
2. press "Reparent" button
3. no columns are visible for a chart
Test 2
1. start ColumnChartTest
2. press "Delete Series" button
3. no columns are visible for a chart
Actual Results:
Chart is empty
Expected Results:
Test 1: chart should show columns like it was before
Test 2: chart should show one column for a first series
Workaround (if any):
Workarround is in the ColumnChartTestWW project attached.
Changes in the mx overrides:
1) IAxis, added method isTransformRegistered to have the ability to check if DataTransform registered for axis.
2) AxisBase, added isTransformRegistered implementation
3) DataTransform, changed setAxisNoEvent method to check if data transform is actually registered in the axis.
Description:
The issue is Series.dataTransform has not symetric code.
It has code that can unregister dataTransform from the axis but doesn`t have a code to register it again.
Instead, it relies on DateTransfrom.setAxisNoEvent to do it.
In the SDK 3.4 setAxisNoEvent registered it every time.
In the SDK 3.5 new test condition was added to the DateTransfrom.setAxisNoEvent "if (oldAxis != newAxis)" and it causes this bug.
In some cases this condition doesn`t make sense.
Even if (oldAxis == newAxis) test should be done to check if transform registered in the "newAxis" or not.
I added this code in my workarround.
Also I can reproduce this bug under SDK 4.1.
Attached ColumnChartTest41 archive: test project + workarround (the same as for SDK 3.5).
