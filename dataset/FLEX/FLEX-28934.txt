Summary:
Modal windows aren't modal on Mobile devices
Description:
NOTE Even though I marked "ALL" it works fine on desktop in simulator, but fails on both Android and iOS
Steps to reproduce:
1. Use PopUpManager to addPopup or createPopup
2. You now have the ability to click anything else on the screen.
3. Fail.
Actual Results:
User is able to click anything in the background, disregarding modal status.
Expected Results:
User should not be allowed to click anything that isn't a child of modal window.
Workaround (if any):
None.
Extra Notes:
Using AIR 3.0
I've also set the modalTransparency values to that of the standard spark theme since the mobile theme to see if maybe drawing a background fixed things, but to no avail.
In order to use my FXP example, you will need to supply a valid ID in the app descriptor (if deploying to iOS, this MUST match your provision file's ID).
To anyone that suggests I should be using SkinnablePopUpContainer::open() should realize that that method is extremely simple, and does nothing more than make a call to PopUpManager.addPopUp(this, owner, modal); Utilizing SPUC does not fix this issue!
