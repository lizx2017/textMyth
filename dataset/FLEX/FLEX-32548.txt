Summary:
Shift-click does not work correctly after programmatically selecting initial row
Description:
Found running from FlexBuilder using Flex SDK 3.3 and the Datavisualization 3.3.
Steps to reproduce:
1. create an ADG with allowMultipleSelection = true; and selectionMode="multipleRows"
2. programmatically select a row using adg.selectedItem = object;
3. shift-click in the data grid to select multiple rows
MXML attached

only row highlighted is the one that was programmatically selected

expected all rows between the programmatically selected and the row that was clicked to be highlighted
Workaround (if any):
None that I've been able to find.
