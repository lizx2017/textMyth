Summary:
A Flex WSDL call which yields resulting XML of about 5MB or greater will cause "A script has executed for longer than the default timeout period of 15 seconds." error
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1.Make a WSDL call with parameters that yield a 5MB result or greater (~10,000 rows).
Actual Results:
Internet explorer becomes inactive and have transparent white overlay during processing of WSDL results. The error seems to occur in AbstractInvoker.as in the resultHandler when it call processResult on line 188.
Expected Results:
The results return to the Flex application and are successfully stored in the ResultEvent object.
Workaround (if any): Send parameters that will yield partial results within a specific range. Repeat process with a different range until all results received. For example get back rows 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, etc until all rows received.
