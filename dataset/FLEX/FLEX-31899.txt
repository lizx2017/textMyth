Summary:
"rowInfo" does not contain information on all rows during an item collapse
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1.Run the attached sample in debug mode
2. Expand the root item
3. Collapse the root item
The sample traces the valid rows that are in rowInfo at the following checkpoints during the process of expanding and collapsing an item:
Expand and collapse animation start
Expand and collapse animation update
Expand and collapse animation end
Valid rows = rows with ListRowInfo instances that actually represent a data item (as opposed to an "empty" cached instance).
Actual Results:
After action #2, you will see 3 traces for all checkpoints.
After action #3, you will see 1 trace for all checkpoints.
Expected Results:
After action #2, you will see 3 traces for all checkpoints.
After action #3:
You should see 3 traces for the "start" and "update" checkpoint.
You should see 1 trace for the "end" checkpoint.
