Summary:
playback using the Flex 3 SDK is slower than SDK 2
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Compile the complex application with the automation agent.
2. Record a test case
3. Playback the recorded test case.
Actual Results:
The time elapsed between a simulated click and the next one is too long. It depends on the application complexity, but I found that the average time is about 8/10 seconds.
Expected Results:
A faster playback
Workaround (if any):
Workaround not found.
