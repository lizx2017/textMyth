Summary:
If you tap on the red underlined spell checked word the app crashes.
Description:
I created a very simple sample project that only had one view with 6 <s:TextArea controls. I used skins and unskinned, Tried different properties. Nothing kept it from failing on the TextArea skin or unskinned control that had spell check available. Tried bring into the project the skins.StageTextAreaSkin to trouble shoot without luck.
