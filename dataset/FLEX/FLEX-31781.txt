Summary:
Plotting a single value smaller than 1e-10 causes LinePlot to Crash.
Description:
Sorry, not sure what the "Moxie" above means.
/instance/com.adobe.flexbuilder.project/flexBuilderVersion=2.0.155577
Steps to reproduce from Scratch:
1. Create new project
2. Add Panel, then add a LineChart
3. Make a Line series, xField="x", yField="y", insert it into an empty array, and assign your lineChart's series property to this 1-element array.
4. In creationComplete (or anywhere in code), make the chart's dataProvider an array with a single object, with array[0].x=1, array[0].y=1e-20.
5. Save and Run
Or, using attached program:
Put a value smaller than 1e-10 (but greater than 0) in the text field.
Actual Results:
Hangs browsers. Some values for a little while, but the smaller values appear to crash it.
Expected Results:
If a circle renderer is used, expect a single point on a plot. If not, expect an empty plot.
Workaround (if any):
2 options, neither is satisfactory:
1 - On reading input, change values to ones that won't make it crash.
2 - Don't plot single values.
