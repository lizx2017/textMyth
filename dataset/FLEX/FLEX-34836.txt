Summary:
Infinite loop occurs when a BitmapImage uses image smoothing and its width and height is 0
Description:
See FLEX-27180. It is still relevant. If the BitmapImage is placed in a component that by chance scales to 0 width/height, the infinite loop will be entered. Caused quite a bit confusion...
Look for the resample method (BitmapImage.as: 1636, Flex SDK 4.14.1, build 20150325)
protected static function resample(...)

while (initialScale/drop < 1)
initialScale /= drop;
