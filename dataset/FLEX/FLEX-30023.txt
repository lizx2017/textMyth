QTP is not recognizing the FLEX objects even after compiling the application (mxml files) with automation libraries.

1.Performed appliation mxml compilation with automation libraries as per the instruction provided in the docs.
2.Installed QTP plugin on the client machine and accesed the appliation URL from the client machine.
3.Observed that FLEX objects are not getting identified by using QTP.
Actual Results:
FLEX objects are not getting identified by using QTP

Flex Objects should identify by using QTP plugin.

But when we are using run time approch ,after placing the RunTimeLoading.html and runtimeloading.swf in the application serevr,we have accessed the application by using the http://hostname:port/RunTimeLoading.html ,QTP is recognizing the
objects but the application is not behaving as expected when we are accessing the application by using the same URL( http://hostname:port/RunTimeLoading.html)
