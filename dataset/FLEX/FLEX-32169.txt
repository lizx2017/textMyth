Summary:
LineChart with LinearAxis doesn't display correctly with large numbers
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1.Compile and run attached code or open swf
Actual Results:
The Original data has large x values and the line is clearly not right since there are multiple points for the same x coordinate.
The In Thousands and In Millions display correctly(the difference in the data is purely dividing the x coordinates by a thousand and a million respectively)
Expected Results:
The line on all graphs should look the same.
Workaround (if any):
It seems to work with smaller numbers, so you could scale down your numbers to get it to work.
