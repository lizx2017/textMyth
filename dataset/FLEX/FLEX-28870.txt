Summary:
When debugging multi-module projects debugger doesn't resolve breakpoint randomly
Description:
Use Linux or Windows
Steps to reproduce:
1.Clone example application hg clone https://bitbucket.org/sgr/bug-in-fdb-from-flex-sdk
2.Install Apache Maven version 3.0.1 or higher.
3.Set environment variable flexSdkHome pointing to Flex SDK folder, the value should not contain whitespaces.
4.Change your current folder to bug-in-fdb-from-flex-sdk
5. Type mvn install, after build completes open folder shell/target
6. Open file shell-1.0.swf with browser which has debug version of flash plugin or standalone flash player debug version
7. You will see an application which loads two modules. When you click the first button, the first module is loaded,
when you click the second button, the second module is loaded. Each time you load module previous module is unloaded.
8. Click 'Load Module 1' button. Then click 'Load module 2' button. Then click 'Load Module 1' button again.
9 At this point Module 1 is loaded and we should be able to set breakpoints.
10. Run fdb debugger, type r
11. In browser right click on running application and select 'Debugger' menu item, then connect to localhost
12.fdb will say that module is loaded
13. In fdb type b Module1.mxml:15 to set breakpoint in Module1.mxml line 15.
Actual Results: breakpoint is not resolved in 5 out of 10 experiments
Set breakpoints and then type 'continue' to resume the session.

(fdb) b Module1.mxml:15
Breakpoint not set; no executable code at line 15 of Module1.mxml#175
Expected Results:debugger resolves breakpoint.
This bug makes impossible to use FlexSDK debugger and Intellij Idea in large-scale projects which load several modules. We have noticed it in Flex SDK 3.3, it persists in 4.5.1 on both Linux and Windows.
