Summary:
Advanced Data Grid throwing script error
Description:
Hello,
We have been using Flash builder 4.6 with SDK 4.6.0 for our development purposes since the last couple of years. While using it, we have observed one issue with the use of Advanced Data Grid containing hierarchical data. Broadly our observation is that if the grid contains a large result set with hierarchical data, then on expanding and collapsing the items repeatedly, the following error is thrown
TypeError: Error #1010: A term is undefined and has no properties.

at mx.controls.listClasses::AdvancedListBase/mouseMoveHandler()[E:\dev\4.y\frameworks\projects\advancedgrids\src\mx\controls\listClasses\AdvancedListBase.as:9374]
On investigating the case further we have found out that the problem is due to a function called ‘itemRendererToIndices’ in the AdvancedListBase.as file of the SDK. A wrong row index is computed which in turn causes the error. Can you please provide us support for this problem. If so, what is the procedure we need to follow.
