Summary:
Automation Drag / Drop DragSource object doesn't contain added items
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
Create an Air application with two Advanced datagrids (ADG1 and ADG 2)
1 Add eventlistner drag_Start to ADG1. In this handler fill the datasource and start drag:
var xPath:String = (grid1.selectedItem as TreeData).label;
var dragSource:DragSource = new DragSource();
dragSource.addData(xPath, PROPERTY_XPATH);
dragSource.addData(grid1.selectedItem,"selectedItem");
DragManager.doDrag(UIComponent(grid1), dragSource, event);
2. Create an eventlistener drag_Drop to ADG 2. In this handler you will use the data of the DataSource object to add the draggeditem to ADG2 :
var xPath:String = event.dragSource.dataForFormat(PROPERTY_XPATH) as String;
(grid2.dataProvider as ArrayCollection).addItem(event.dragSource.dataForFormat("selectedItem"));
So far so good this works beautifull real time but when using automation the datasource object doesn't contain the items added in drag_start of (Adg1).
We are using Riatest for recording. The script look like this :
FlexAdvancedDataGrid("grid1")=>dragStart("Company 4 | | ");
FlexAdvancedDataGrid("grid2")=>dragDrop("copy");
I noticed when replaying that the DataSource object is constructed form event.ClipBoard.formats. This is in the NativeDragManagerImpl.as. But as you will guess event.ClipBoard.Formats doesn't contain the items added in the drag_Start handler of ADG1. In this case it only contains: [0] "items",[1] itemsByIndex and [2] "caretIndex"
Please provide us any help because we haven't got a clue what to do next. Or does the Flex automation framework doesn't support dragSource at all? Just default drag drop operations without using DragSource object works ok .
please also take a look at the application attached. Record the drag drop operation and replay this script. You will see DragEvent.DragSource doesn't match the information added to this object .
Looking forward to hear from you !
Kind regards
