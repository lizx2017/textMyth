Summary:
[MUSTFIX]QuickTest Pro (QTP) - when replaying Click method on an upload flexbutton, Window's upload window does not open
Description:
Using QuickTest Professional(QTP) 9.5 and Flex Addin
QTP is able to record clicking on a flexbutton, which opens a Window's upload dialog window (see attached screenshot). However, upon replay, the upload window does not open. No QTP errors are displayed. From QTP's Object Repository, QTP is able to recognize the flexbutton, so it does not appear to be object recognition. It seems that an event is not being triggered upon replay.
This issue occurs on all flexbuttons that open a Window's upload (open file) window.
See attached screen shot for button and Window's upload dialog window that is suppose to open.
Is this a known issue? Can you recommend any workarounds?
Thanks
