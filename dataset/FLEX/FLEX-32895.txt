Summary:
LinearAxis baseAtZero was not working while dynamic creating mulitple axis
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. run the test2.mxml
2. click the button to create a new axis
3.
Actual Results:
the linear axis for column series was not working any more.
although i set the baseAtZero to false ,it come out nothing... it seems that it will not consider the data source value.
Expected Results:
the same functioning as i haven't added new axis
Workaround (if any):
1.set the axis maximum and minimum by yourself (not for real world application)
2.If you want to create multiple axes, you have to dynamic create all elements (everything including the chart) in action script or just defined all the axes and series in the mxml.
