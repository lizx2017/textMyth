Summary:
AdvancedDataGrid class should not have code that uses hard-coded sample data when running in design mode
Description:
In its constructor, ADG installs an event handler for FlexEvent.UPDATE_COMPLETE. In that handler, updateCompleteHandler, it sets hard-coded data if the UIComponentGlobals.designTime flag is true.
First, design view code should not be in the core SDK. Sample data for ADG should be implemented in the design view code.
Second, setting the dataProvider in an UPDATE_COMPLETE handler can trigger an endless stream of UPDATE_COMPLETE events in certain circumstances. This is the cause of bug FB-26597.
The hard-coded data is in ADG for SDK 3.5 and 4.0, and is in the current build of SDK 4.0.1. That code should be removed from future versions of the SDK.
