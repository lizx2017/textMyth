Expected Results:
The AdvancedDataGridAccImpl does not check for out of bounds child Ids that are used as indices into the ADG data provider. Screen readers can sometimes send negative values or values that are greater than the length of the data provider. In addition, the ADG assumes that the hierarchy iterator structure will be used for hierarchical data. If an ArrayCollection is used instead then there is no hierarchy iterator object and an error occurs when this object is accessed since it doesn't exist.
SSB recommends that appropriate checks be put into the AccImpl code to verify that (1) childIDs are within range before being used as indices, and (2) objects exist before an attempt is made to reference them. On failure of either of these conditions, the AccImpl code should return the appropriate null value for the type of value being requested by assistive technology.
