Summary:
InstallApacheFlex downloads binaries, requires warnings
Description:
IIUC InstallApacheFlex automatically downloads Flex binaries (FLEX-33187).
As the ASF does not release binaries [1], I think the installer needs to warn its users that they should get the source code instead if they want an ASF release.
