Summary:
Using "public" reserved word to name object property
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a database with a table that has a column named "public".
2. Select all data in that table and return the array of objects paired columnName.columnValue.
3. Create an ArrayCollection from that Array. You should now have acData[i].public, where i is an integer of course.
2. Create a static public method in a new class, e.g. MyClass.someStaticMethod() that takes a string argument and returns it back.
3. Inside Flash Builder <fx:Script> tag do something like var str:String="Hello, "+acData[i].public;
4. See public coloured blue as if it was the public keyword. Code doesn't break.
5. Change the code to this: var str:String="Hello, "+MyClass.someStaticMethod(acData[i].public);
6. Observe all hell break loose. (all import statements are not recognized, classes used in project fail nothing works. Calling the optimize code (CTRL+SHIFT+O) will remove all imports or most etc)
Workaround (if any):
1. Don't use "public" reserved word for property names, damn it!
2. Use obj["public"] instead, but first one is preffered
