Summary:
mxmlc does not make use of settings in jvm.config on OSX
Description:
Based on documentation from here: http://help.adobe.com/en_US/flex/using/WS2db454920e96a9e51e63e3d11c0bf69084-7fd9.html#WS2db454920e96a9e51e63e3d11c0bf5fb32-7ff3__WS2db454920e96a9e51e63e3d11c0bf5fb32-8000
We should be able to increase allowable heap size used when running MXMLC. However, if you look at line 67 of bin/mxmlc, you will see that the maximum heap size is hardcoded to 384mb (see here: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/flex/sdk/trunk/bin/mxmlc?view=markup line 67). This will pose a problem for developers who try to compile SWFs with large assets (like PNG spritesheets for mobile development).
