Summary:
ADGHeaderRenderer sortItemRendererInstance should be protected.
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Try to derive from ADGHeaderRenderer and place one more icon by the side of the sort control.
2.
3.
Actual Results:
It is very difficult to position the new icon next to the sort icon because sortItemRendererInstance is private in ADGHeaderRenderer.
Expected Results:
sortItemRendererInstance should have been protected in ADGHeaderRenderer to allow extensibility.
Workaround (if any):
Copy the whole ADGHeaderRenderer code and tweak it.
