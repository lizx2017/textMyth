Summary:
DateTimeAxis formats dates strangely when labelUnits is milliseconds
Description:
When labelUnits on a DateTimeAxis is set to "milliseconds" then the axis labels are formatted like: "14:02:230123" The milliseconds are attached on to the end of the minutes, separated with a "0". This seems bizarre to me and I would be surprised if this is the intended behavior.
The expected behavior, for me, is for the labels to be formatted like "14:02:23.123" - i.e. with a "." separating the seconds and the milliseconds.
See the attached screenshot for an example of the weird behavior.
If someone from the Flex team can confirm this is something that should be changed, I can try and submit a patch. The pertaining code is in DateTimeAxis.formatMilliseconds(...) - it looks pretty weird to me anyway: it contains an if-branch that will always be taken, and some unnecessary string allocation.
