Summary:
Cannot scroll to the bottom when using variable row height and calculateRowHeight() with some rows are very large
Description:
How to reproduce:
1. Run the attached Main.mxml application
2. Scroll down
Observed:
Cannot scroll past the large row.
Expected:
It should be possible to scroll past the large row.
The calculateRowHeight() method of the ADG can be overridden to allow to customize the height of rows in variable row height mode. In our application we override it to synchronize the layout of rows with an external component.
The problem here is that calculateRowHeight() this method is not used by the ADG in all places where the height of rows is measured. In particular it is not used in AdvancedDataGridBaseEx.adjustVerticalScrollPositionDownward(). As a result when some row get a large height it becomes impossible to scroll past such a large row.
See the attached AdvancedDataGridFixed extends AdvancedDataGrid and implements a workaround for this issue, lines 194-213.
