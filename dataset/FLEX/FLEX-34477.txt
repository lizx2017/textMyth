Summary:
Mobile TextArea can not be scrolled when editable=false
Description:
Setting editable=false on spark TextArea disables scrolling of text content on mobile devices.
Also, when editable=false and user touches TextArea, soft keyboard opens (although no text is added if typed).
Issue occurs with spark.skins.mobile.ScrollingStageTextAreaSkin - spark.skins.mobile.TextAreaSkin works as expected.
