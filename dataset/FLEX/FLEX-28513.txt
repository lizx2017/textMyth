Summary:
Nested scrollers tend to get "stuck" in horizontal or vertical scrolling mode
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Load sample application. It has a horizontal page-scrolling list, and each item in the list scrolls vertically.
2. Swipe left a couple times to move to different items (or swipe up/down to scroll)
3. Swipe up/down to scroll (or swipe left/right if you were swiping up/down in step 2)
Actual Results:
After several scrolls in one axis, it is hard to scroll on the other axis.
Expected Results:
No problem switching scroll axis.
