Summary:
Arrows don't move focus in ADG appropiately when Jaws 9 is running
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
Load application, attempt to use arrow keys to move through ADG
Actual Results:
Arrows don't move focus between rows (forms mode on or off) consistently (or at all in forms mode off). Only hitting escape allows up/down arrow navigation. But then once focus leaves the grid (if tabbing is attempted or if mouse clicks occur outside of application), focus does not return to grid.
Expected Results:
Up/down arrows should move focus between rows in a consistent manner, without requiring use of escape key. If focus leaves the grid/application, it should be able to re-gain focus when tabbed to.
