Summary:
[FlexJS] HContainer visible false not respected (JS only)
Description:
In this app:
https://paste.apache.org/2gpf
hContainer.visible = false
but inspection reveals that style.display is 'block'
This is due to this code:
public function set strand(value:IStrand):void
{
host = value as ILayoutChild;
COMPILE::JS
{ ((value as IUIBase).element as HTMLElement).style.display = 'block'; }
}
But I'm not sure why it's necessary.
