Summary:
Android and IOS: SPUC SK Effects: SPUC moves even when no keyboard is activated
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run the attached project on iOS
2. Open "SPUC View"
3. Click "Open Skinnablepopup Container"
4. click on text area inside the SPUC to activate keyboard
5. Pop up moves up for the softkeyboard
6. Close the pop up and reopen it
Actual Results:
SPUC moves up even when there is no softkeyboard. This happens mostly the second attempt on iPOD but in a few attempts on iPAD.
Also, over a few times, the resize does not happen - this could be related to missing keyboard events bug - SDK-31688, SDK-31513 (though that is an Android bug).
Expected Results:
SPUC does not move when there is no Soft Keyboard
