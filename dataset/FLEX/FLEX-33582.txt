Summary:
Scroller and scroll speed regarding first child
Description:
When i change the first child of a scroller (Group or VGroup) the scroll speed with mouse wheel change.
Try running the attached project (uncomment/comment the Group 'childrenGrp' to see difference).
You should have a scrollbar going almost to the bottom with 1 mouse wheel when childrenGrp is commented. When childrenGrp is uncommented you need to scroll much more.
Other problem appear when childrenGrp is commented, the paddingTop and paddingBottom on the VGroup give strange behaviour to the scroller (impossible to scroll to top or to the bottom).
