Summary:
Compiler fails to transcode embedded fonts
Description:
Existing AIR application with embedded fonts compiles properly with Flex 4.6 SDK but fails with Apache 4.10.0.
Apache air-config.xml is identical between the two environments, but when I look at the contents of the two lib directories there seem to be a lot of font-related jar files missing. The ones from batik seem suspiciously absent, but a diff of the Apache lib and Flex lib directories ought to be an easy way to compare for critical dependencies.
