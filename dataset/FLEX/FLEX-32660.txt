Summary:
AdvancedDataGrid does not fire either change or value commit events when selectedItem, index, or indices are changed
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create an ADG and populate with data
2. select a row using the mouse
3. use the arrow down, page down, page up ...
Actual Results:
ADG selection changes, but no event was dispatched.
Expected Results:
ValueCommit event would be dispatched
Workaround (if any):
None
Looking at the code, problem is because it is coded inconsistently and sometimes sets the selectedxxx using the setter and other times using the _selectedxxx. When using _selected events are not fired.
