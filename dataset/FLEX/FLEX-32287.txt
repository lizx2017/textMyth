Summary:
AdvancedDataGrid cell scroll when mouse wheel is used over a multiline cell
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create an AdvancedDataGrid with at least one column.
2. Populate the data grid with multiline results, using \n on your result set.
3. Make sure you have variableRowHeight property set to "true" on your AdvancedDataGrid.
4. Hover the cursor over a cell with a multiline text and scroll the mouse wheel.
Actual Results:
The cell content is vertically scrolled.
Expected Results:
The cell content remains at its current vertical scroll position.
Workaround (if any):
1. Extend the AdvancedDataGridItemRenderer class, override the validateProperties() method and set the mouseWheelEnabled property to "false" or use the attached class file (AdvancedDataGridFixItemRenderer.as).
2. Set your AdvancedDataGrid column itemRenderer property to your class name.
