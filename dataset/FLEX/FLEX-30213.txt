Summary:
Numeric Stepper component is not playing back as it supposed to when we use the mouse click to change the focus from the field
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
Record following steps:
1. In a numeric stepper field, enter a value say 5
2. Using mouse click on any other field to change focus (We have to change focus because entering a value in numeric stepper field doesn't trigger the change event.
3. Playback the above recorded script
Actual Results:
During playback, after setting the value to 5, it automatically decreases the value to 4
Expected Results:
The recorded value (5) should be set during playback
Workaround (if any):
Instead of using mouse to change the focus if we use tab key it records the ChangeFocus() and plays back correctly.
