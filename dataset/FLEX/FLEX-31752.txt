Summary:
Weird bug when moving your mouse over a header of a advanceddatagrid.
Description:
Version: FB3 M3 B2 (3.0.183654)
First this error happens often when you move your mouse on a header, just move over no click.
It's a weird error and i dont know how to reproduce it but i get it a lot.
I have a advanceddatagrid with grouped columns and background on the columns i have no mouse over effects, the debugger gives me this error and i cant get any more information:
TypeError: Error #1010: A term is undefined and has no properties.
at mx.controls::AdvancedDataGrid/findHeaderRenderer()[C:\Work\flex\dmv_automation\projects\datavisualisation\src\mx\controls\AdvancedDataGrid.as:1304]
at mx.controls::AdvancedDataGrid/mouseEventToItemRenderer()[C:\Work\flex\dmv_automation\projects\datavisualisation\src\mx\controls\AdvancedDataGrid.as:1270]
at mx.controls.listClasses::AdvancedListBase/mouseMoveHandler()[C:\Work\flex\dmv_automation\projects\datavisualisation\src\mx\controls\listClasses\AdvancedListBase.as:8070]
Expected Results: Nothing, since i didnt click anything.
Workaround (if any): Dont install a debug flash player so the end-user wont notice it or just click continue.
