Summary:
Unable to create new dictionaries when using the Tools/SpellingDictGen project
Description:
Trying to build the SpellingDictGen in order to generate other dictionaries that I need to support. The project libraries complain that MetaPhone and SuseDictionary do not exist.
I have tried using the latests and olders lib swcs I could find without any luck.
Anyone with any ideas or is anyone able to point me to the direction of a generated .air for this project.
