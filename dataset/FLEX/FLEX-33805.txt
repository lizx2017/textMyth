Summary:
Mixed up whitespaces in .xml files
Description:
In files like flex-config.xml (and other, maybe nearly all files) the whitespaces are not consistent. Some lines are using only spaces, some only tabs and some are mixing up spaces and tabs. This also causes often the indentation to be wrong.
