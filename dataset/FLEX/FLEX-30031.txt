1. Consider a FlexDataGrid with 3 empty rows with 3 columns.
2. Start Recording in QTP. Click on third column of each empty row of a FlexDataGrid.
3. Notice the recorded statements. No change in the recorded statements even if you click of different rows.
Actual Results:
Grid.Select " | | **"
Grid.Select " | | **"
