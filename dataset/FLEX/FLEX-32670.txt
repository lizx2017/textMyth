Summary:
Different background colors for different headers in Datagrid using lockedColumnCount
Description:
The Flex 3 Datagrid allows us to use the headerColors for applying the header background colors. However, I want a scenario in which we can use the different background colors for different headers.
I found 1 such solution on http://ntt.cc/2009/02/18/set-background-color-for-headers-of-datagrid.html
However, the problem is when I use lockedColumnCount on the grid, then it is considering grid as 2 portions and the headerColors don't get displayed properly. i.e. the 1st column of the lockedColumnCount shows the same header background color as the 1st column of the non frozen section. However, when I remove the lockedColumnCount, It works perfectly fine.
Seems there is some bug in lockedColumnCount and this needs to be resolved urgently.
Atleast, please let me know a solution for applying different background colors for different headers on a datagrid which is using lockedColumnCount
Thanks,
Varun Vijaywargi.
