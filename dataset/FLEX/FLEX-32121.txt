Summary:
Editable advanced data grids throw an RTE clicking on the header, under some circumstances
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Paste the following code into an MXML application:
<mx:ArrayCollection id="sourceData">
<mx:Object name="Karl" surname="Schwarzschild"/>
<mx:Object name="Subrahmanyan" surname="Chandrasekhar"/>
</mx:ArrayCollection>
<mx:AdvancedDataGrid dataProvider="
{sourceData}
" editable="true"
sortableColumns="false" draggableColumns="false"/>
2. Run the application and click on a cell to edit it
3. Click on the header
Actual Results:
A runtime error is thrown.
Expected Results:
None (columns are neither sortable or draggable).
Workaround (if any):
Set at least one property among draggableColumns and sortableColumns to true. To keep sorting and dragging disabled, leave sortableColumns set to true set sortable="false" for each column.
The problem is in AdvancedDataGridBaseEx.mouseDownHandler() method: at line 5534 it disposes the currently displayed item editor before going on, but the entire section is skipped when the datagrid has both draggableColumns and SortableColumns set to false - probably it should dispose the editor anyway, because the columns can be clickable even under these conditions.
