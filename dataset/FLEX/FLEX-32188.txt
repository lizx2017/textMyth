Summary:
Keyboard scrolling is corrupted when verticalScrollPolicy is turned off and the grid is poplated with a list taller than the grid height and then repoplulated with a list that fits its height.
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
Install the attached demo.
Example 1 (ADG VerticalScrollPolicy = Off, list exceeds ADG height)
1. Collapse Southwest branch to a list size that fits in the ADG height completely and click the item to select it.
2. Press the down arrow key multiple times to see ADG list item jump to the bottom and then the item copy itself in the display as the alternatingItemColors scroll.
3. When the display stops changing, press the up arrow key ONCE.
4. Press the down arrow key ONCE.
5. Press the up arrow key repeatedly till the alternatingItemColors stop scrolling.
6. Press the down arrow key repeatedly till the alternatingItemColors stop scrolling.
7. At this point, up and down arrow keys no longer change the display, which is totally corrupted.
Example 2 (more insight, ADG VerticalScrollPolicy =Auto, list exceeds ADG height)
1. Click in the ADG to select an item and scroll up and down with the arrow keys.
2. Collapse Southwest and click it to select the item and do the same with the keys. All is working correctly here as the selected item scrolls in a spatially chronological fashion in sync with the key strokes.
3. Click the "Set Vertical Scroll Policy Off" button to set the vertical scroll policy to off. Click the item to select it and scroll up and down with the arrow keys. All is working correctly here as well
4. Expand Southwest and click any item to select it. Scroll up and down with the arrow keys. All is working correctly here as well.
5. Collapse Southwest and click it to select it. Press the down arrow key repeatedly. The display corrupts as the selected item jumps to the bottom and the the alternatingItemColors scroll as the down arrow key is pressed repeatedly.
6. Keep pressing the down arrow key until the alternatingItemColors stop scrolling.
7. Press the up arrow key ONCE and the header highlights.
8. Press the down arrow key ONCE. The application raises an Actionscript error (the crash is dependent on the height of the ADG for some reason. This does not happen in Example 1).
9. Press continue on the actionscipt error and then click on the item in the ADG and the actionscript error raises again. Repeat step 8 for infinity.
10. Refresh the browser.
11. Click the "Set Vertical Scroll Policy Off" button. Click the "Set Vertical Scroll Policy Auto" button to reset the verticalScrollPolicy to Auto. Collapse Southwest.
12. Click the collapsed Southwest item to select it and repeat steps 6 through 8 with the same result, but in this case the VerticalScrollPolicy has been turned back on.
Example 3 (most insight)
1. Double Click Southwest in the left master ADG to populate the right slave ADG and scroll up and down with the arrow keys in the slave ADG. All is working correctly here as the selected item scrolls in a spatially chronological fashion in sync with the key strokes.
2. Double Click Arizona in the left master ADG, click any item to select it and scroll up and down with the arrow keys in the right slave ADG. All is working correctly here in like fashion.
3. Click the "Set Vertical Scroll Policy Off" button to set the vertical scroll policy to off and click any item in the slave ADG to select it. Scroll up and down with the arrow keys in the slave. All is working correctly here in like fashion.
4. Double Click Southwest in the left master ADG to populate the right slave ADG, click any item in it and scroll up and down with the arrow keys in the slave ADG. All is working correctly here as the selected item scrolls in a spatially chronological fashion in sync with the key strokes.
5. Double Click Arizona. Press the down arrow key repeatedly until alternatingItemColors stop scrolling.
6. Press the up arrow key repeatedly until the items reappear and alternatingItemColors stop scrolling, then click on down again .
7. Repeat up and down ad infinitum. Display is corrupted and the selected item jumps around as well as the two items. No crash occurs. In this case, with two items you can scroll up and down continuously without raising the actionscript error.
8. Double Click Central California and click the item in the slave ADG to select it.
9. Press the down arrow key repeatedly until alternatingItemColors stop scrolling.
10. Press the up arrow key once.
11. Press the down arrow key once. The application raises the actionscript error as before.
Actual Results:
With the verticalScrollPolicy off, if the ADG has been poplulated with a list of items that exceeds its height at any point in its history, some internal reference value is set for the scrolling that is not reset when the list size decreases by collapsing the tree or populating the grid with a smaller item list that fits in the height of the ADG. When you then scroll in the smaller sized list, the display corrupts and if the list has only one item, the display will crash depending on the particular key strokes pressed and the height of the ADG.
Expected Results:
Selected item highlight and focus should track up and down with the arrow keys in a spatially chronological fashion.
