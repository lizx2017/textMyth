Summary:
Chart Vertical Axis Title rotation.
Description:
Found in Version, not sure what you are asking here, I am using Flex Builder 3.0 (build 3.0.194161), with SDK 3.3.0. (option not listed).
Steps to reproduce:
1.Create column or bar chart with series data, use one of your 'doc' examples.
2.Embed a font into the application.
2.Assign a vertical axis renderer to the vertical axis.
3.Assign a labelrotation of either 90 or -90 to the vertical axis (via axis render)
4. Assign a title to the Horizontal and vertical Axis.
5. Flip the vertical title with verticalAxisTitleAlignment="vertical"
6. create a Rotate object mx.effects.Rotate.
7. rotate the the canvas the chart is on by an amount, say 90, or better still 180n
Actual Results:
You will notice the vertical label displays the same way, outwards. (rotated 90 right). Also Horizontal title is now upside down, no way to 'flip' it (like you can with the vertical one).
Expected Results:
The label, when rotated -90 should display inwards, rotated left!
Should be able to 'flip' horizontal axis title as well as vertical.
Should be able to specify any value greater than 90 for the label rotation, currently any number greater than 90 is ignored.
Workaround (if any):
None that I have found.
Notes:
If you are wondering why I need this, its because. I have to rotate my charts to indicate orientation, but I need the labels to still be readable, once I rotate the chart, the labels appear upside down, and I am unable to correct it.
Footnote, Bug reporting is quite a involved procedure!
