Summary:
Custom dataTransform objects are removed from stacked ColumnCharts
Description:
Found in SDK 3.2.0
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a custom CartesianTransform and set it to the ColumnSeries of a stacked ColumnChart
OR:
1. Run the attached code.
Actual Results:
After creationComplete, notice that the custom transform has been replaced with the default mx CartesianTransform
Expected Results:
The ColumnSeries.dataTransform property contains the custom CartesianTransform.
Workaround (if any):
None that I know of. Please suggest.
NOTE: This does not occur with clustered ColumnCharts. The attached code demostrates how it fails in a stacked ColumnChart but works fine with a clustered ColumnChart.
The problem stems from the StackedSeries constructor which assigns a CartesianTransform to the dataTransform property.
