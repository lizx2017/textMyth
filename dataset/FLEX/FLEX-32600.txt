Summary:
PieChart displays incorrect percentage number when one of the wedge has a extremely small value.
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a PieChart component.
2. Create an XML object with two items, one with value "2147483646" and the other one with value "1".
3. Make the XML object as dataProvider for the PieChart.
Actual Results:
The PieChart displays two percentage values, "99.99%" and "4.656%". The value of "4.656%" is incorrect.
