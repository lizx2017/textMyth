Summary:
ResourceManager.getInstance().getString() returns "undefined" instead of null
Description:
not sure who to re-open the bug https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLEX-25045 but the problem is there again:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a resource bundle with key value pairs
2. Load the resource bundle in your application and add them to the resourcemanager instance
3. Use the ResourceManager.getInstance().getString() method with a key that is not in the resource bundle
Actual Results:
The return value is "undefined" as a string
Expected Results:
The return (according to the docs) should be null
Also the current implementation always creates a new string rather than returning a string from the resource bundle content.
var value:String=String(resourceBundle.content[resourceName]);
because for strings: String is the same as new String and not a typecast
