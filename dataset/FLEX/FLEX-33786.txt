Summary:
Flash Player uses permanently 1% of cpu time
Description:
Compiling a simple application like "<mx:Application frameRate='1' xmlns:mx='http://www.adobe.com/2006/mxml'></mx:Application>" with mxmlc and playing it with the flash player (for example in a browser) will cause the flash player to use permanently 1% of cpu time of 1 core. Pointing to an empty file will cause the flash player to go into idle. But I'm not sure if the generated code from Apache Flex causes the flash player to use this cpu time or if it is a problem directly in the flash player (so I'm posting it first here).
