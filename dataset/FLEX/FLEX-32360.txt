Summary:
HierarchicalData - AdvancedDataGrid - selectedItem is incorrect after sort / filtering
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Compile and run the attached mxml
2. First Select the last row in the datagrid ( Item Value: 5 ) - 5 displays in the text box indicating selected item value
3. Change the sort order of the value column so that its now descending (ie. 5 is @ the top )
4. Select the last row in the datagrid again ( Item Value : 1 ) - 5 displays again in the textbox
Actual Results:
The value 5 is displayed after selected item value 1 .
Expected Results:
The value should be 1 ie. the one I just selected .
Workaround (if any):
none
There are several other bugs with similar behavior but they seem to be in limbo , hence I'm logging a new one ..
(eg: http://bugs.adobe.com/jira/browse/FLEXDMV-1315 )
Note the problem also appears if I have a filterfunction - eg: filter ALL or VALUES > 3 .. Applying the filter of > 3 select value 4 ( position 1 ) - unapply filter select position 1 ( which now contains value 1 - but value 4 is in the selectedItem ) ..
