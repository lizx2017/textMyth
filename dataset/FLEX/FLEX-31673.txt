Summary:
Resizing columns after setting minColWidth to be more than the current value is erroneous
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Compile and run the bugfile.
2. Click on the "Set MinColWidth" button.
3. Click on the separator between the columns "Year Duration" and "Moons"
Actual Results: MinColumnWidth property is not correctly handled on setting it to a higher value on runtime as resizing of columns is erroneous
Expected Results: MinColumnWidth should be handled correctly when set on runtime
Workaround (if any):
