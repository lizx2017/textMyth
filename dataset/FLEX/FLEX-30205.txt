Summary:
qtp not seeing flex objects when using shared libraries
Description:
qtp not seeing flex objects when using shared libraries
When creating one swf file containing automation packages, QTP is able to see Flex objects
<include-libraries>
...
<library>/libs/automation.swc</library>
<library>/libs/automation_agent.swc</library>
<library>/libs/qtp.swc</library>
</include-libraries>
However, for our application, we have decided to use shared libraries to reduce the footprint our swf file.
Our swf files now point or link to shared libraries. In this configuration, QTP cannot see the flex objects.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Build swf that uses shared libraries with the automation packages in the library
2. make sure QTP plug-in is installed in QTP
3. Try to record with QTP
Actual Results:
QTP will not record
Expected Results:
QTP should record
