Summary:
When a PieSeries has only one PieSeriesItem, the only Item's label is never displayed
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Please compile the attached BugReport.mxml and run the compiled swf.
Actual Results:
Only the left PieChart displays its labels.
Expected Results:
The right PieChart also should display its labels.
Workaround (if any):
In PieSeries.as (also attached), the function measureInternalLabes() tries to remove the labels too close each other
to render. For this purpose, a while clause in ll. 2607-2644 calculates rscale. But if sortedLabels.length==1, ld.next and
ld.prev are always the same as ld itself. It makes rscale always 0, then the only label is always deleted.
To avoid this, the while clause should not work when sortedLabels.length == 1.
