Summary:
Spark VideoPlayer can't play videos, sounds works but no video
Description:
We rebuilt our existing project (which used VideoPlayer to play f4v video tutorials) using Apache Flex, and the tutorial videos now remain black, but audio track plays correctly. This has been tested with f4v & flv videos, including the sample video from Tour de Flex.
Steps to reproduce
1. Use sample code below. Point video source at attached video file (taken from Tour de Flex)
2. Run project
Actual results:
The video loads and starts playing, the progress bar shows the correct video length and moves. The video player remains black. Videos with sound will play the audio track as expected.
Expected results:
Video loads and plays with video and sound outputs.
