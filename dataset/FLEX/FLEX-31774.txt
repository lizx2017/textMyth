Summary:
CLONE -Advanced DataGrid - Floating Column Separator created after columns array is updated
Description:
See attached mxml code.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create an Advanced DataGrid that rebuilds the column array when a specific item is clicked in the navigation tree.
2. Initiate the event in the SWF to rebuild the column array (removing the 2 existing columns and adding 4 new columns)
3. Initiate the event in the SWF to rebuild the column array again (removing the 4 existing columns and adding 2 new columns - the original columns)
Actual Results:
An additional column separator is displayed in the header row.
Expected Results:
No additional column separator. The ADG should return to its original view when the columns are recreated.
Workaround (if any):
None found so far. Attempted to use removeSeparators method, but this was not recognized by the compiler.
