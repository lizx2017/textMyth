Summary:
Automation: getAutomationChildren in Spark Application
Description:
This might or might not be a RIATest bug. Please test in a non RIATest environment to confirm.
Run the attached example and inspect the automation hierarchy. I used the RIATest inspector.
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<s:Application xmlns:fx="http://ns.adobe.com/mxml/2009"
xmlns:s="library://ns.adobe.com/flex/spark"
xmlns:mx="library://ns.adobe.com/flex/mx"
skinClass="AutomationTestSkin">
<fx:Script>
<![CDATA[
override public function getAutomationChildren():Array
{ return [ skin, myButton3]; }
]]
>
</fx:Script>
<s:Button id="myButton3" label="MyButton3" width="200" height="200"/>
</s:Application>
Actual Results:
The RIATest inspector shows all automation children inside the skin and the myButton3 outside it; however, it cannot properly select myButton3.
Expected Results:
Display all automation children inside the skin + the myButton3 instance.
Workaround (if any):
Move the myButton3 + skin code inside a container (not directly extending from Spark Application)
