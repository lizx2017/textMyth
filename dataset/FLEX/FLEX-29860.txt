Summary:
QTP9.2 is unable to record Flex menu bar and not flexlist whcih is under menu bar.
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1.I've added this code line in TEAFlex.xml
to this node:
<ClassInfo Name="FlexListLabel" GenericTypeID="text_label" Extends="FlexDisplayObject" SupportsTabularData="false">
added:
<Implementation Class="Components::UIComponent"/>
Actual Results: QTP is unable to record FlexMenuBar.It goes away to select sub menu item under flex menu bar.
Recorded script is
there should be one line where we've put our flex list.
Example :Browser("B").FlexApplication("app").FlexApplication("ResultSpace.swf").FlexMenuBar(Tracker").Show "defect"
But QTP does not record that line it go to below line
Browser("B").FlexApplication("app").FlexList("index:5").Select "Defects"
I used to low level recording but no success.
Expected Results:QTP should able to record flexmenuBar as class and able to select flex list.
Please help me out how QTP can record FlexMenuBar.Is there any need to make any setting?
Thanks,
