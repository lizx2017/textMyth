Summary:
Charts could not select an item whose minimum value equals to maximum value with region select
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1.Create any Chart (I tested with ColumnChart and HLOC)
2. Add series to that chart (eg: ColumnSeries)
3. Set "yField" and "minumum" values of that series.
4. Run the application
5. While selecting a region contains items, the items whose yField and minumum values equal couldn't be selected.
It's also the same in the HLOCChart that has items whose lowField and highField are equal.
Actual Results:
Programmer can't get some selected items in the selected region.
Expected Results:
Programmer could able to get all items in the selected region.
Workaround (if any):
May be handling the mouse events could help programmers.
