Summary:
TEAPluginIE.dll Doesn't load for Flex 4 apps using QTP 10
Description:
TEAPluginIE.dll does not load when recording with QTP 10 against a Flex 4 app. Flex 4 app build path includes all the automation libraries and they are all listed in the Additional Compiler Options with the -include-libraries option. This is on Windows XP SP3 with MSIE 8 and the QTP Plugin for Flex 4 obtained March 30, 2010 from the Adobe website on the Flex downloads page. The Flash Player 10 Debug for ActiveX is installed in MSIE (The one that shipped in Flash Builder 4).
The DLLs from the Flex4 QTP Plugin are registered correctly with regsrv32. In fact, using the same OS, same MSIE browser, same QTP, I can successfully record scripts against the public Flex Store application from Adobe that has been instrumented for automation. When I test Flex Store, the TEAPluginIE.dll does load.
I am attaching 2 screenshots:
1) Problem: Shows Process Explorer on the iexplore.exe process where TEAPluginIE.dll does not load when testing Flex4. Shows Compiler Args too.
2) Works: Shows same environment where the DLL does load correctly when testing Flex 4.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Configure WinXPSP3/MSIE8 for QTP10 and the Flex4 Plugin
2. Compile an application for Flex 4 with automation libraries
3. Test QTP 10 recording of Flex 4 automation-instrumented app, then compare to recording of Flex Store.
Actual Results:
QTP cannot record Flex 4 apps that have been instrumented for automation.
Expected Results:
Should work as documented for recording test scripts with QTP and Flex 4.
