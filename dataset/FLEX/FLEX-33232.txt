Summary:
Loop video property adding delay between repetitions
Description:
Setting loop as property of a videoplayer/videodisplay and playing creates a not gapless playing experience, between repetitions the audio and video stops (no audio e black video) for less than a seconds. This create a bad video experience
[EDIT]
The only way i found to reduce this effect is to add a listener to the time change event and seek to the start of the movie when the elapsed time is not equals to the movie duration time.
