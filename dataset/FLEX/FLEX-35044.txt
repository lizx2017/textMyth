Summary:
ComboBox don't set selectedItem correctly after resetting dataProvider
Description:
I've recently migrate from Adobe Flex 4.5.1 to Apache Flex 4.15. Everything was fine, except from some bugs on Charts and this bug on combo.
Issue: When I set a dataProvider to the combo, and then set the selectIndex, selectedItem was correctly setted.
But after setting dataProvider again and setting the same selectedIndex, the selectedItem is now null.
Workaround:
Override dataProvider method on a new component based on ComboBox and setting "selectedItem = undefined" after setting super.dataProvider.
