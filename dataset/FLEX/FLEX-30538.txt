Summary:
Selection in charts using shift key
Description:
Reproduction:
1. Create a sample column chart with two or three series values.
2. Use shift and right arrow keys to select items.
3. Once the end of a series is reached (selecting all the items in that series) it suddenly wraps to the first item in the next series SELECTING the first items in the two series but DESELECTING all the other items selected from the first series.
Actual Results:
The wrapping of the selection to the items in the next available series deselecting the earlier selected items from the first series is very confusing.
Expected Results:
Wrapping should not occur to the next series item OR it should not deselect the items previously selected.
