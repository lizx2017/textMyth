Summary:
Spark ActionBar chromeColor is ignored in Flex 14
Description:
In a ViewNavigatorApplication I have the following style specified:
@namespace s "library://ns.adobe.com/flex/spark";
s|ActionBar
{ chromeColor: #404040; titleAlign: center; }
In Fle 13.0 and earlier, this gives me a dark gray background on my app's actionbar but in Flex 14 it gives me a white actionBar. Can anyone provide a workaround or solution?
