Summary:
Instantiation attempted on a non-constructor error in AdvancedDataGridBaseEx
Description:
This is happening to me consistantly in code I am porting from Flex 3 to Flex 4. Assuming it's not happening to everyone since its not already in the bug base and I only found one mention of it via google, which was in the Adobe forums.
Don't know the root cause, but do know what is happening and how to fix it.
This is in version 4.0.0.14159
Getting a Instantiation attempted on a non-constructor error in AdvancedDataGridBaseEx at line 4618. The code is using getStyle to get the headerSeparatorSkin and then instantiating the returned class. The problem is that null is being returned and not checked for before trying to instantiate it.
current code lines 4616-4618
var headerSeparatorClass:Class =
getStyle("headerSeparatorSkin");
sepSkin = new headerSeparatorClass();
recommended fix
var headerSeparatorClass:Class =
getStyle("headerSeparatorSkin");
if (headerSeparatorClass && headerSeparatorClass is Class)
{ sepSkin = new headerSeparatorClass(); }
else
{ sepSkin = new DataGridHeaderSeparator(); //the default }
Workaround: Setting Framework linkage to "Merged into code" fixes the problem, so the root cause may be that the style isn't getting set correctly when the framework is linked via RSL.
