Summary:
Advanced Data Grid will not collect if item is selected
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
NOTE: Not sure I have selected the proper "Found in Version". See comments at end of this note for version info.
1. Open an AdvancedDataGrid with data
2. Select an item in the list by clicking with the mouse
3. That instance of the AdvancedDataGrid will never collect. Even if the record is unselected, once clicked it fails.
Actual Results: Leak
Expected Results: No Leak
Workaround (if any): Fall back to milestone build 3.1.0.2710
I noticed this first in build 3.2.0.3614, but thought the error might be an issue with miss-match of visualization components and framework. Still see error on milestone build 3.2.0.3958.
Attaching a simple reproduction scenario.
