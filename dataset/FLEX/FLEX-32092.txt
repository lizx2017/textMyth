Summary:
Wrapping Text in advanceddatagrid
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Unzip file and open flex builder project (flex 3 beta 3)
2. Text in label column do not wrap correctly when the column gets resized. A checkbox is rendered in this particular colomn. The Description colomn resizes correctly, i would expect same behaviour in label colomn. Resiz repeatedly.
3. Possible workaround have been implemented called commitProteries. It is not working yet.
Actual Results:
Text oveflow into the description column
Expected Results:
Text to wrap correctly, even if column is resized to a small size, text should not overflow into description neighbouring column.
Workaround (if any):
It has been suggested to modify the width of label in base classes, this have been done and do not resolve the issue, it seems the label.x,image.x and icon.x once changed it appears to affect the width of the column on resize, it seems like the resize is ignoring the fact that additional elements have been added to the renderer. Maybe I am just missing an additional property to be set.
