Summary:
BitmapImage don't show up in specific case
Description:
BitmapImage doesn't show image when:
size specified by procent (width="100%")
imageAspectRatio doesn't exactly math display aspect ratio - for example 1.0869565217391304 and 1.0869565217391305
In my case display width=480, image size is 800x736.
in BitmapImage.as in function updateDisplayList there should be some rounding, something like:
if (Math.ceil(aspectRatio * 1000) != Math.ceil(imageAspectRatio * 1000))
{
invalidateSize();
return;
}
because two Number doesn't equals exactly, they differs in some last digits:
1.0869565217391304 and
1.0869565217391305
