Summary:
Error: unknown configuration variable 'compiler.targets' when using bin/mxmlc and bin/compc
Description:
flex-config.xml includes defaults for compiler.targets. compiler.targets is defined in org.apache.flex.compiler.clients.JSConfiguration. I suspect that bin/mxmlc and bin/compc use org.apache.flex.compiler.config.Configuration instead, since they're for SWFs.
I'm guessing that compiler.targets should probably be defined in Configuration instead of JSConfiguration.
This also affects the VSCode extension. For SWF projects in VSCode, I use Configuration for compiler options. I've (temporarily) switched to JSConfiguration instead because I was getting the same error. However, I'd prefer to continue using Configuration so that VSCode will display proper compiler errors someone tries to use JS-specific options (like source-map, for instance) with a SWF project.
