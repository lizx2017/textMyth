Summary:
QTP Obj Repos Mgr highlights incorrect object if state changes and object no longer exists
Description:
I have attached a screencap movie of the process to reproduce as well as the mxml to do it.
Steps to reproduce:
Try the attached mxml - it has instructions in the app
1. Use Object Repository Manager (ORM) to make a repository from the app: note that three text input controls are present
2. Press the button in the app to move to State 3, where the second 2 controls no longer exist
3. Use the Highlight button in ORM to try to highlight the 2 missing text controls.
Actual Results: The single remaining text in put will be highlighted - this is an error.
Expected Results: The app should give an error saying that the object coult not be found.
This throws off scripts that are testing for the existence (or non-existence) of objects; if it returns true when it shouldn't this throws off our test plans.
