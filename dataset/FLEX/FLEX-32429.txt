Summary:
DateTimeAxis vs. Daylight Savings: labels hang (fixed?) and graph region wrong
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Compile and run DST_wrong_data_region.mxml => wrong data region
2. Compile and run DST_hang.mxml => hang
The results below were observed for both Mac OS and Windows.
Actual Results:
1. DST_wrong_data_region.mxml: two graphs are laid out side by side, with the DST graph showing an extra hour in the data region, and one hour seemingly coalesced
2. DST_hang.mxml simply hangs. Using the constant APRIL rather than MARCH (i.e. non-DST time range) causes the script to run fine.
Error: Error #1502: A script has executed for longer than the default timeout period of 15 seconds.
[rest of error messaged same as existing tickets]
Expected Results:
1. Data region should not stretch or coalesce across daylight savings time boundaries â€“ date time axis should always behave according to UTC time scale.
2. Graph should not hang.
Workaround (if any):
Wrong data region: none discovered.
DST_hang.mxml is a very simple version of some of the other scripts I've seen uploaded. It is convenient to use it to verify that previously posted workarounds do not seem to work, except for note below.
The previously posted workaround of disabling daylight savings time seems to work under Windows, but is commercially unfeasible as we cannot force our end users to disable day light savings time.
Conclusion: no feasible workarounds discovered.
