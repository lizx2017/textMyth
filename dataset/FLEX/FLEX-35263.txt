Summary:
[FlexJS] Layout Does Not Reset ContentView Width After Elements Removed (HTML only)
Description:
In this app:
https://paste.apache.org/EiP5
Aftrer clicking 'Remove' you still see scrollbars on mainGuy.
The problem is fixed if in BaicLayout we replace
if (!hasWidth && n > 0 && !isNaN(maxWidth)) {
with
if (!hasWidth && !isNaN(maxWidth)) {
But I'm not sure that doesn't break anything.
