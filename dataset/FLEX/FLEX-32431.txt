Summary:
AdvancedDataGrid.itemEditEnd not always firing with custom itemRenderer
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. run attached test_datagrid.swf
2. click 'Add' 4 times to add 4 rows to the datagrid
3. click in the 4th row's datacell, highlight the 0 with the mouse, change it to 1
4. click in the 3rd row's datacell.
5. click 'Dump' to dump the contents of the ArrayCollection
Actual Results:
Row 4 (ac[3].hours) contains 0
Expected Results:
Should contain 1
Workaround (if any):
none.
This issue does not happen every time, but more than 75%. If it doesn't happen the first time, click 'Clear' and try the steps again.
This does not appear to happen with less than 4 custom itemrenderers being displayed.
It does not happen unless you use custom itemrenderers
It only appears to happen when you select the current value by highlighting with the mouse, or double-clicking the cell, and then enter a new value.
If you add more than 4 custom itemrenderers, it becomes more frequent.
The same project using DataGrid rather than AdvancedDataGrid does not seem to fail.
