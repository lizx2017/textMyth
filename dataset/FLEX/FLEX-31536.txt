Summary:
Flex Framework Integration: 'textDecoration' and 'leading' styles are now inherited and must be updated
Description:
'textDecoration' and 'leading' styles are now inherited and must be updated ("inherit=no" must not read "inherit=yes" in Style metadata) in the following files (at least, that I have found with grep):
AxisRenderer
ChartBase
BarSeries
ColumnSeries
PieSeries
LeadingStyle
TextStyles
Attaching the updated files, which you can integrate if you like.
