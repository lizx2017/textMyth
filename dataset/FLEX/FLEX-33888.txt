Summary:
Failed to compile conditional Vector creation
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Compile this:
var v:Vector.<String>;
v||= new <String>[];
2. Compilation failed with: "Error code: 1067: Implicit coercion of a value of type Class to an unrelated type _AS3_.vec:Vector."
AIR sdk compiles this without any errors.
Workaround: use if condition instead.
