Summary:
Apache Flex 4.15, Adobe AIR 23, MAC OS Sierra | Worker stops unexpectedly
Description:
First of all, sorry, I cannot describe our issue very specific for now.
We are using Flex and AIR for building a desktop application under Windows and MAC. Under Windows all is working fine, but under MAC the used workers stopped unexpectedly at any point. We are using workers e.g. for downloading data and it stopped at 4 MB or 10 MB or 100 MB without any further information.
Has anyone an idea?
Thanks in advance.
