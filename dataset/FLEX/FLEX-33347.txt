Summary:
DateSpinner dateAndTime jumping
Description:
As reported on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9126194/flex-mobile-4-6-datespinner-dateandtime-jumping-from-jan-31st-to-march-1st:
set the date in DateSpinner to January 30 or 31 (using mouse or touch)
click (mouse or touch) on February 1 (visible one or two rows below on the DateSpinner)
The Datespinner does spin forward but does not stop at February 1: it jumps to March 1. The same behavior can be observed with March 31 - mouse click on April 1 causes a jump to May 1; with May 31 - mouse click on June 1 jumping to July 1, and so on.
I suspect this behavior is related to the fact that the next month has less days than the prior month (30 instead of 31, or 29 in the case of February 2012), but it is not the behavior that I would like to see when following these two steps. Does anyone know a workaround or fix?
When the DateSpinner is set with displayMode as 'date' all is well, but that doesn't work in my use case.
