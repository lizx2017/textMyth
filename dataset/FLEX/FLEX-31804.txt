Summary:
AdvancedDataGrid's sorting is wrong on Number (it compare as string not number) with ASP.Net
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Make MXML with AdvancedDataGrid & ASP.Net data bind
2. Get result from server
3. Sort by Number field
Actual Results:
Sorted by as string
Expected Results:

Workaround (if any):
Use sort compare function, but it is not practical.

I think Flex 2 or Flex 3 beta 1 did not have this issue.
