Summary:
[MUSTFIX] AdvancedDataGridBaseExAutomationImpl replayAutomatableEvent does not set itemRenderer for headerRelease event
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create an application which handles headerRelease event for an AdvancedDataGrid and uses itemRenderer property of the event.
2. Record and replay headerRelease event for the AdvancedDataGrid.
3. itemRenderer property of AdvancedDataGridEvent passed to application handler during playback is set to header render as expected but during replay it is null.
Actual Results:
itemRenderer property of AdvancedDataGridEvent passed to application handler during replay is null.
Expected Results:
itemRenderer property of AdvancedDataGridEvent passed to application handler during replay is set to header item renderer. This will be consistent with DataGrid headerRelease event replay which does set itemRenderer as expected.
Workaround (if any):
Change headerRelease event application handler to avoid using header itemRenderer or get it from headerItems array.
