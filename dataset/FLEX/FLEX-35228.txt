Summary:
[FlexJS] Usage of statics in JSSharedData causes problems
Description:
The compiler uses JSSharedData to share data between different parts of the compiler. This is causing problems in the maven plugin as the FlexJS tool group initializes instances of all types of compilers at lookup time. Unfortunately the settings of the individual compiler implementations blead into each other because of these statics. It would be better to move these settings into the FlexJSProject object and get rid of the statics. This would also make the compiler able to run in parallel which would allow parallel compilation of maven artifacts.
