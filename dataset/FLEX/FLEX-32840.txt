Summary:
seeting color of trend line using Cartesian data canvas
Description:
We have used the Flex chart control to plot a chart with multiple series. One of the requirements is to plot corresponding trend lines for each series. Since the Flex chart control does allow automatic plotting of trend lines, we have handled this by using the CartesianDataCanvas which draw's line on the charts. However, there is an additional requirement
That the trend line color must match the color of the series that it is representing. We are not setting the color of the series.The flex is assigning the colors automatically. In this case we have used the getstyle ("fill") property to retrieve the color but the color is not matching to that of the series. We are creating the series at runtime since the number of series is fetched from the database.
We have also tried to set the fills of the series after the series array is assigned to the chart but it is not reflecting on the chart. Below is the code that we used to set the fill of the series
for each (var ci:LineSeries in lineChartRoot.series)
{ var colorInt:uint; var c:SolidColor = new SolidColor(colorInt); c.alpha=.9; ci.setStyle("fill",c); }
<mx:LineChart id="lineChartRoot" showDataTips="true" width="100%" height="100%" seriesFilters="[]"
axisTitleStyleName="axisTitles"
mouseDown="dragChart(event)" dragEnter="dragEnterChart(event)" dragDrop="dragDropChart(event)">
<mx:annotationElements>
<TrendLineCanvas:TrendCartesianDataCanvas id="trndLine" includeInRanges="true"/>
</mx:annotationElements>
<mx:verticalAxis>
<mx:LinearAxis id="lnrAxisKpi1" />
</mx:verticalAxis>
<mx:horizontalAxis>
<mx:CategoryAxis id="cat1" categoryField="YearMonth" title="Month"/>
</mx:horizontalAxis>
<mx:horizontalAxisRenderers>
<mx:AxisRenderer axis="
{cat1}
"/>
</mx:horizontalAxisRenderers>
</mx:LineChart>
Please let us know if there is a mechanism to handle this requirement with the current Flex chart control.
