Summary:
Applying sort with complex dataField on DataGrid results in unintuitive item ordering
Description:
When using a complex dataField in a spark DataGrid, the sort compare function uses the default string comparison which unintuitively places "Name" before "ame".
Expected behaviour: the complex dataField comparison should work the same as the simple field comparison.
