Summary:
DataGridAutoImpl does not record Select properly when showHeaders == false
Description:
This bug is found in 3.2.0
I am using FlexMonkey (and it is way cool), but I believe this bug is
in the file DataGridAutoImpl.as,
in the method getItemAutomationNameOrValueHelper() at lines 179 to 180.
Specifically, the code
if (grid.headerVisible)
++row;
should probably be just
++row
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create an application with a DataGrid that is populated with data.
2. set DataGrids.showHeaders=false
2. Attempt to record a row select.
3. Note that the DataGridAutoImpl method returns the data for the row just above the row selected.
