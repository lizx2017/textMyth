Summary:
Flex Mobile - Removing audio from NetStream, or closing NetStream, freezes application (100% CPU and unresponsive)
Description:
Tested on HTC Desire Z, and ASUS android tablet.
When the audio is removed from a NetStream, using either attachAudio(null) or by closing the NetStream, the application freezes up, but only after the NetStream has been connected to Flash Media Server and viewed by somebody.
I created an adobe forums post regarding this issue looking for a workaround, which can be found here: http://forums.adobe.com/thread/921369
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create NetConnection to Flash Media Server (4.5)
netConnection = new NetConnection();
netConnection.connect(rtmp URL);
2. Create a NetStream connected to the NetConnection
outgoingStream = new NetStream(netConnection);
3. Publish the NetConnection
outgoingStream.publish("name");
4. Attach a camera and mic to the NetStream
outgoingStream.attachCamera(camera);
(Attach the camera to a local video display to get it to stream)
outgoingStream.attachAudio(mic);
5. Play the video on the same or another device
incomingStream.play("name");
Note: Video and Audio should be streaming properly at this point
6. Stop the audio
outgoingStream.attachAudio(null);
OR
outgoingStream.close();
Actual Results:
Application freezes up (100% CPU and unresponsive) without crashing.
Expected Results:
Audio for the stream stops and the application continues to function as it did before the audio stream was started.
Workaround (if any):
None, would greatly appreciate one.
