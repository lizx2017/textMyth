Summary:
Some dateFormat locale properties not well displayed by DateField
Description:
The DateField has its own Date formatting function that doesn't handle every pattern.
As an example a Date (in en_US 12/31/2013) will appear 3112122013 in several languages.
The affected locales are:
fr_FR
nb_NO
nl_NL
sv_SE
The issue is due to the month format : MMM declared in locales/
{locale}
/SharedResources.properties
The DateField.dateToString function could consume all the M not just the second one.
Updating the dateFormat properties can solve this but could have impacts on other components.
