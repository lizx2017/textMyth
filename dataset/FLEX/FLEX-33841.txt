Summary:
[ASDoc] Make ASDoc output an error when reading invalid input
Description:
If ASDoc reads invalid content it doesn't report an error and fail, but it generates an invalid xml document, which makes other tools fail.
Had to manually update the Flexmojos Sources in order to prevent trouble with this:
