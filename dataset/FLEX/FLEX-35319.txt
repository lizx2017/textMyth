Summary:
Tweens effect timer not stopped
Description:
This code is doesn't stop the timer:
private static function removeTween(tween:Tween):void
{ delete activeTweens[tween.id]; if (activeTweens.length == 0) timer.stop(); }
As activeTweens is an Object not an array, length is undefined, so timer.stop() never gets called.
