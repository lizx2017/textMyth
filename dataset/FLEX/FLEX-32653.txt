Summary:
A Legend on the 2nd page of a ViewStack lays out incorrectly if in a NavigatorContent and the ViewStack's creationPolicy = all.
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a ViewStack with creationPolicy = all, which contains two NavigatorContents.
2. Each NavigaorContent contains a LineChart and a Legend
3. Each NavigatorContent's layout property is a HorizontalLayout or VerticalLayout.
Actual Results:
The Legend on the first page of the ViewStack shows its items vertically. The Legend on the second page shows its items horizontally. This even occurs if you swap the positions of the NavigatorContents in the code.
Expected Results:
They should be consistent (both vertical).
Workaround (if any):
There are a few options:
1) Don't use creationPolicy = all.
2) Use BasicLayout instead of HorizontalLayout or VerticalLayout.
3) Use Halo containers (HBox/VBox) instead of a NavigatorContent.
Note that setting labelPlacement and/or direction of the Legend does not work as a workaround.
