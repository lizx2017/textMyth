Summary:
AdvancedDataGrid incorrectly handles modification of data if used as GroupingField
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Compile and run attached files, TestAdvancedDataGrid.
2. Note that there is an AdvancedDataGrid, which has a GroupingCollection as it's dataProvider. The GroupingCollection has an ArrayCollection bound as it's source. The three TextInputs are bound to a specific item in the ArrayCollection.
3. Edit the text in either the "Outer" or "Inner" TextInputs.
4. View the AdvancedDataGrid.
Actual Results:
New folders are created in the AdvancedDataGrid whenever the "inner" or "outer" data is changed to something which hasn't already been seen. The data item is added to some/each of these, sometimes more than once.
Expected Results:
The folder names in the AdvancedDataGrid should update when a data item's property changes, if that field is used as a GroupingField for the GroupingCollection.
Workaround (if any):
Manually call groupingCollection.refresh() whenever the underlying (flat) collection is changed. This causes the AdvancedDataGrid to have the correct structure, but it collapses all the trees. I have tried but cannot figure out a way to either keep the tree expanded or re-expand the tree after a refresh(). See TestAdvancedDataGrid2 in the same .zip file.
