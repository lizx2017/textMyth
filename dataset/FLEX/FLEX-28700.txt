Summary:
DropdownList error on key finding
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Set up the attached project
2. Launch TestDropDown application
3. Select the second dropdown list and type in the "t" letter twice
Actual Results:
The second input will produce a runtime error (Null Error)
Expected Results:
The second input shouldn't produce any error, and the highlighted item should be "tata"
Workaround (if any):
The labelFunction should never return a null statement
Actually i reproduced the bug with Flex 4.5.1 aswell.
I overrided the DropdownList (even though the bug is nested in the List component), and added a test before using the result of the labelFunction return.
In the project you'll find a component named AdvancedDropDownList with the specified changes at line #23.
Sorry for my not so good english, and i hope you'll understand my means.
