Summary:
AreaSeries.Stack() creates an infinite loop
Description:
while (!cursor.afterLast)
{ /* CODE REMOVED */ if(xValue == null) continue; // *INFINITE LOOP* /* CODE REMOVED */ cursor.moveNext(); }
To fix this the if statement should do a cursor.moveNext() before it calls continue;
WORKAROUND:
Make sure the xField variable is properly defined in all AreaSeries.
