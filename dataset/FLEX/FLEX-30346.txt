Summary:
Flex3 QTP plugin performance issue - object recognition of an sdk3.4 application is very slow
Description:
We are facing a similar issue as FLEXENT-749 while automating our flex 3 based application.
We have tried with Flash Builder 4 with SDK3.4 and the problem persists with it too.
Object recognition particularly is very slow. IE Browser consumes 100% CPU.
Our application is with flex builder 3.0.2 compiled with 3.4 SDK. In the source bug (FLEXENT-749) you have provided a particular version of qtp.swc.
Can you please provide an appropriate version of qtp.swc that I need to use?
Thanks
