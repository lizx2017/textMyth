Summary:
override mx_internal function getImageClass 4.5.2
Description:
New Steps to reproduce:
1. open the attached .fxp.
2. try to compile the project first with 4.5.1 then with 4.6.0.
result:
4.5.1 works fine. in 4.6.0, you get 1023: incompatible override.
expected:
this code should work in 4.6.0 as well.
-----------original steps -------
Just opened my app with 4.5.2, that was working fine in 4.5.1.
First error I got was a "override mx_internal".
I'm using the example code from Jason San Jose article:
http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/articles/mobile-skinning-part2.html
I was able to correct the problem, but I feel this is a backwards compatibility issue.
Notice that "aspectRatio" and "dpi" are switched, and I added the "resolution"
My old CODE::: override mx_internal function getImageClass(dpi:Number, aspectRatio:String):Class{
My new CODE::: override mx_internal function getImageClass(aspectRatio:String, dpi:Number, resolution:Number):Class{
