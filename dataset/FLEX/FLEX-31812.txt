Summary:
Crash When Chart is resized Horizontally with Axis Rotation
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Load example code from http://livedocs.adobe.com/flex/2/langref/mx/charts/LineChart.html.
2. Embed the Verdana font
3. Set the linechart axis renderer styles for the vertical axis:
labelRotation 45
fontFamily Verdana
fontSize 45
4. Resize the window so that there is no vertical space.
Actual Results:
Crash: Type Error thrown and application layout UI becomes unresponsive.
You can watch the chart slowly shrink down and leave whitespace above as you increase the label rotation and size. Shrinking the window then causes the crash.
