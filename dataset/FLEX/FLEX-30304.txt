Summary:
The ItemRenderer for Spark List and DataGroup does not support custom renderers for automation
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a custom ItemRenderer by extending the spark ItemRenderer class
2. Place a button inside the custom item renderer
3. Use the custom item renderer in a Spark List (or DataGroup)
4. Use QTP and try to select the button inside the custom item renderer using the QTP Object Spy
Actual Results:
The QTP Object Spy recognizes the custom item renderer as a SparkListLabel and does not recognize anything inside the custom item renderer.
Expected Results:
The child components of the item renderer should be exposed to QTP Object Spy with having to create a custom automation delegate.
Workaround (if any):
Create a custom automation delegate for every custom item renderer.
