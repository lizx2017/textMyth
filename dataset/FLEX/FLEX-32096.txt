Summary:
Poor OLAP performance
Description:
The "Query" performance of the OLAPCube component is abysmal.
The attached slowolap.mxml builds a 32K row table of data with random values and then builds a simple OLAP grid from this data source. Executing the OLAP query on these 32K rows takes 27 seconds to run on my (Intel Duo 1.8hz) laptop.
27 seconds!!!! That means the Query process can only process about a 1000 rows per second.
By contrast, I coded up my own Query code. Using the most disastrously inefficient but general approach I could (viz a dictionary of dictionaries to simulate the 2D grid created in OLAP), my query and SUM worked in just over a second. I stress again: I deliberately used the most general and inefficient approach I could think off and it was still an order of magnitude faster than OLAPQuery.
What alarms me about this (and hence the strong language here) is that this issue has been reported before: http://bugs.adobe.com/jira/browse/FLEXDMV-1428 but seems to have been brushed off and dismissed.
Essentially, the OLAP grid as it currently stands is unusable except for trivial datasets. Which is a shame because it doesn't have to be.
I'm working with Flex Builder 3 Professional (release build 3.0.194161)
