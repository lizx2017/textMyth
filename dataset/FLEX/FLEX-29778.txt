Summary:
AIR PLUGIN When adding a checkpoint to a label sometimes QTP adds the checkpoint code to the script and sometimes it doesn't.

2.Click on Automation->Record in QTP.
3.Click on Insert->Checkpoint->Standard Checkpoint in QTP.
4.Click on a label or a button in the open application.
5.Click on the OK button in the Object Selection-Checkpoint Properties Window.
6.Select a property value pair within the Checkpoint Properties window and click on OK.
Actual Results:Sometimes the checkpoint code is inserted into the QTP script and sometimes it is not.
