Summary:
Wrong variable assignment in the ChartBase.as (horizontalDataTipOffset)
Description:
check the code ChartBase.as line 3462
The code is ...
var dataTipHOffset:Number = getStyle("horizontalDataTipOffset");
var dataTipVOffset:Number = getStyle("horizontalDataTipOffset");
the developer is setting horizontalDataTipOffset (in line 2 above) to a vertical offset variable.
We have done a horizontal offset of the tooltip and because of the above bug, it is offsetting it vertically as well.
The code should have been ...
var dataTipVOffset:Number = getStyle("verticalDataTipOffset"); //instead of horizontalDataTipOffset
I am sure this should be an easy fix.
