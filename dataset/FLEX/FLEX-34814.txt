Summary:
Css + svg : Exception during transcoding - unable to transcode
Description:
Hello, I try to use Apache flex sdk 4.14 instead of the old 4.1 sdk
I works very well but I have a problem with some css styles :
.BoutonCheck{
skin:Embed("../assets/check-128.svg");
disabledSkin:Embed("../assets/check-D-128.svg");
}
Exception during transcoding
Unable to transcode
And i have the exact same problem with :
<mx:Image id="vboxMenuIm" x="0" y="0" width="20" height="169"
smoothBitmapContent="false" source="@Embed(source='assets/ options.svg')"/>
It worked perfectly in sdk 4.1, so does the svg format now unsupported or is it a bug?
Thanks for your help
