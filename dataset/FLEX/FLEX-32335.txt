Summary:
Setting the vertical axis at the AreaSet level does not take effect
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. import project
2. run notWorking.mxml
3. workaround: run working.mxml
Actual Results:
setting the vertical axis at the areaset level doesn't bind the areaseries to the axis
Expected Results:
setting the vertical axis at the areaset level should bind the areaseries to the axis
Workaround (if any):
Setting the vertical axis at the areaset level and binding it to each areaSeries works properly; this seems like double work
