Summary:
Have updated Flex SDK3.2.0 from Flex SDK 3.0.0 and Automation env. has been shutdown.
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1.Have updated Flex SDK 3.2.0 on dev Team and our QA Server and automation env. has been shut down. We're not getting application login screen.We've setup automation env. in dynamic.

Was previously using FLEX SDK3.0.0 and our automation env was setup.
Actual Results: Nothing is visible on screen when hit url.
https://delrsngqa2/resultspace/RunTimeLoading.html?automationswfurl=ResultSpace.swf.
Please refer to the attached screen shot.
Expected Results:When hit url login screen should gets displayed.
Workaround (if any):
We don't have any workaround for that.Our automation env has been shutdown when we've updated our FLEXSDK 3.2.0 from FLEXSDK3.0.0.Can you help me to get resolved it?
Note: When investigated i got to know that there is some difference between SDK3.2.0 and SDK3.0.0.
Flex SDK 3.2.0:
-----------------
2.0.1.automation_swcs flex.swc
air framework.swc
automation.swc player
automation_agent.swc qtp.swc
automation_dmv.swc rpc.swc
automation_flashflexkit.swc utilities.swc
datavisualization.swc
2.0.1.automation_swca (automation_agent.swc automation_agent_rb.swc qtp.swc)
Flex SDK 3.0.0:
-----------------
air automation_flashflexkit.swc player
automation.swc datavisualization.swc qtp.swc
automation_agent.swc flex.swc rpc.swc
automation_dmv.swc framework.swc utilities.swc
I copied "automation_flashflexkit.swc" file from SDK3.0.0 and kept it SDK3.2.0 ,but no success.Each and every time we're getting nothing on screen.
Can you help me understand where i'm missing?
