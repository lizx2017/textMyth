Summary:
dataTipFunction doesn't work properly when showAllDataTips is set to true
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a Pie Chart with a dataTipFunction and showAllDataTips set to true
2. In the dataTipFunction, return a string with html bold attribute (i.e. return hitData.item.name + "\n<b>" + hitData.item.value + "</b>";
3. Run the application
Actual Results:
Whatever string you are trying to bold does not work. It does work properly for <i> and <u> tags but not bold.
Expected Results:
showAllDataTips should display the same dataTip as if the user were to mouseOver an item.
