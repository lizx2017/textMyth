Summary:
A graphical drawing is being rendered from/to wrong data points when the origin/destination points are disabled (using WWA in dateTimeAxis)
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run the bug file
2. Select the "valid disabled days" option from the list.
Actual Results: A line is now drawn from "02/08/06" instead of "03/08/06" to origin of chart (actual origin is 27/07/06, which is disabled)
Expected Results: A drawing should not be rendered when the data points are disabled
Use case: If a user had a drawing on the weekends and then disabled the weekends, the user would not want to have the drawing shown on the next closest data point.
