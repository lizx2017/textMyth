Summary:
FlashPlayer not throttling initially while player is under the fold in Safari

Say my flash content is under the fold. In Safari a flashplayer does not fire Throttle event(even though it is under the fold) until one scrolls the flash into view and then back out of view again. And FPS is around 23-26.
