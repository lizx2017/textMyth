Summary:
Sorting a HierarchicalData object after scrolling causes display issues
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Using the attached file, create an ADG that contains a HierarchicalData dataprovider.
2. You must have the scrollbars visible so the list needs to be bigger than what will fit on the browser
3. Scroll the bar into the middle somewhere so there is space on the top and bottom of the scroll track
4. Click on the sort renderer to sort the 'Actual' column
5. Keep clicking on the sort renderer to resort the column the opposite direction
Actual Results:
The data in the grid eventually disappears and appears garbled.
Expected Results:
The data should sort just like with the regular datagrid
Notes:
1) This only occurs with the HierarchicalData object as the data provider
Workarounds:
1) Make the grid scroll up to the top before sort - sort="myADG.verticalScrollPosition = 0;"
