Summary:
part word in notResolved string of automation_agent is not written as its meaning (division) and there is not enough space after NI character
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
Part meaning division or a piece is written パート, whereas for computer parts it is written as in your string.
If it's related to coding and does not relate to part (division), please consider it correct. If not, I would recommend getting it verified by a native Japanese tester.
And the space after NI character should be expanded a bit. It should look like: attached image
ni and so (in japanese). Space between first two characters after
{1}
. almost in all strings.
Actual Results:
"part" is assumed as computer part or is assumed as coding and not as division NI character is used
Expected Results:
part should be defined as division and there should be space after NI character as shown in attached image.
