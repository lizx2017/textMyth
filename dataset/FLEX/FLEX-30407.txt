Summary:
TabBar does not produce buttons that are automation suitable.
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1.Create TabBar with automationName="tbAN"
2.Attach ViewStack to dataProvider of TabBar
3.Compile with automation libraries
4.View objects in QTP, none of the TabBar buttons are populated with an automationName
(see attachments for workaround code)
Actual Results:
Buttons produced by the TabBar cannot be addressed by and automationName. They are only available via their Label.
Expected Results:
Customer reports from Docs:
"If you set the value of the automationName property, testing scripts use that value rather than the default value. For example, by default, QTP uses a Button control's label property as the name of the Button in the script. If the label changes, the script can break. You can prevent this from happening by explicitly setting the value of the automationName property."
The above makes it clear that the default value of the component is the label. However if you choose to, you can explicitly set it using the automationName property. What the docs say is that it will default to the label only if the automationName is not explicitly set. The docs don't mention anything about defaulting to the label if (for some reason) it isn't read properly. Since we have explicitly set the property then it should be used. If it's not read then that's a flaw in the functionality.
Workaround (if any):
TabBar code shows the buttons being created without an automationName, gave workaround of sub classing TabBar and overriding createNavItem(), see attached MyTabBar.as
