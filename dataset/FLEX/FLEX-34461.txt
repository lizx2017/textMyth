Summary:
Scrollbar mouse wheel don't work in Safari 7 and Mac OSX 10.9
Description:
I recently upgraded to Max OSX 10.9 (Mavericks) that includes Safari 7 and observed scrollbar mouse wheel movements don't have any effect on the scrollbar. Previously I used Mac OSX 10.6 (Snow Leopard) and Safari 5 and things worked fine.
To test, simply use Safari 7 with any Flex application that includes a spark scrollbar. Try moving the scroller using the mouse wheel. Nothing happens. Now test the same application in Chrome or Firefox, and things work as expected.
I'll include a sample application below that includes a spark scrollbar, but any application with a scrollbar should work similarly.
Here's an example Flex app you can access online:

I found this bug case:
https://bugbase.adobe.com/index.cfm?event=bug&id=3302758
posted years ago. I thought someone would have found a workaround by now. How do developers address Safari in their applications? Do they just tell their customers the app doesn't work with Safari 6 and above? Or, is there a workaround? Is there any update in the status of this bug in the last couple years? If anyone has experience with this, please enter a comment.
I tested Flash Player 12 debug and the latest Flash Player 14 non-debug and both behave similarly.
I haven't tested MX scrollbar, but suspect it may also have this bug.
