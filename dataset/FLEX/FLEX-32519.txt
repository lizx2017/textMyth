Summary:
[Localization:Hisoft]: All: Loc-WrongTranslation in DMV Automation components
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
Compare the resource bundle strings in DMV Automation components with the strings in the lockit1 glossary.
Actual Results:
95 strings are mismatch with the strings in glossary.
Expected Results:
The output strings are supposed to be exactly the same as the localized strings in the glossary.
Workaround (if any):
Please see the attached file in XML format. There are 95 mismatched string in 12 languages.
1. Most of the mistakes are about lost a single quote at the head of the sentance. (Most properbly reason is that in the glossary file Excel escapes the first single quote, hence the single quote is hidden in the Excel file ).
2. There are many strings left untranslated in locale zh_TW.
