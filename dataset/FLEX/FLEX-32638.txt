Summary:
DragManager.showFeedback in ADG overrides manual drop behavior
Description:
Version numbers in the dropdown are unintelligible to me; I'm using FlexBuilder 3.0.214193.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create ADG "target" with dropEnabled="false" and event handlers for drop events: dragEnter, dragOver, dragDrop
2. Create a second ADG with dragEnabled="true" and some items in it
3. Call DragManager.showFeedback(DragManager.COPY) in dragOver event handler
4. Call event.preventDefault() in dragDrop handler
3. Run, and drag an item into the data grid
Actual Results:
Item is added to the target data grid
Expected Results:
Item is not added to the target data grid.
Workaround (if any):
Remove showFeedback call and use alternate feedback mechanism to communicate "droppability" to the user.
