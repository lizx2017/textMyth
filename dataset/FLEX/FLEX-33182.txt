Summary:
override public in subclass results in public write only property. public override works as expected
Description:
I'll upload a zip of classes and test cases for flexunit that demonstrate this problem. Here's the gist:
We’ve found that the list of accessors is different if a derived class overrides a getter/setter with “public override” vs. “override public”. “override public” introduces an additional write only public property as shown in both describeType output and in Flash Builder.
Here are some simple classes that demonstrate the problem, text continued below.
package publicoverridevsoverridepublic
{
[Bindable]
public class BaseClass
{ public var var1:String; public var var2:String; }
}
package publicoverridevsoverridepublic
{
[Bindable]
public class SubClassOverridePublic extends BaseClass
{
override public function set var1(value:String):void
{ super.var1 = value; }

override public function get var1():String
{ return super.var1; }
}
}

package publicoverridevsoverridepublic
{

[Bindable]
public class SubClassPublicOverride extends BaseClass
{
public override function set var1(value:String):void
{ super.var1 = value; }
public override function get var1():String
{ return super.var1; }
}
}
The attributes of SubClassPublicOverride in Flash Builder include a _3612138var1 property. It’s a private property that according to Flash Builder is write only (only includes a setter). I’m not sure what the purpose of this property is, or more generally any of the private properties I’ve seen in Flash Builder with numeric prefixes like this. And I’m not sure why it is believed only to have a setter. But as it is private, it is not included in the results from describeType().
The attributes of SubClassOverridePublic in Flash Builder have the same _3612138var1 property but this time it is public and write only.
I've never heard of any language treating "public override" and "override public" as semantically different and assume this must be a bug.
Note that some Flex formatters out there are preconfigured to favor “override public” to “public override” (that’s actually what broke us – formatting the file). If you’re not using describeType you probably don’t care. But it’d be interesting to know what else might be different between “override public” and “public override”.
