Summary:
Error installing Apache Flex versions 4.9.1, 4.10, 4.12 or 4.12.1 using installer
Description:
The changes to Adobe SVN (it now requires a user name and password) have broken installs for early versions of Apache Flex. A name password box pops up when trying to install any version of the Flex SDK less than 4.13.0 when trying to download OSMF. OSMF is not an optional component.
This affects versions 4.9, 4.10, 4,12 and 4.12.1 fail to instal. 4.11 and 4.13 work. For versions 4.12/4.12.1 the config files are not correctly updated giving the user a broken SDK.
For 4.9/4.10 the Cancel button is pressed the last step is shown as in error and the log contains:
Downloading osmf.swc from: http://opensource.adobe.com/svn/opensource/flex/sdk/branches/4.y/frameworks/libs/
Unable to download OSMF_SWC
Installation complete.
For 4.13 several last steps are in error and this shows in the log.
