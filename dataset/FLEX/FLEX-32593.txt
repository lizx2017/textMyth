Summary:
The AdvancedDataGrid.selectedIndex property does not return -1 when AdvancedDataGrid focuses its column header.
Description:
When you move the focus of AdvancedDataGrid to column header by key, the selectedIndex property does not return "-1".
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run the attached sample program via the Flex Builder debug-mode.
2. Click the last row whose value is "C".
At this point, the Flex Builder's [Console] window should show that current selectedIndex property.

(Note: Please do not click the column header directly.)
4. When the column header(col1) is focused, review the [Console] window to check the latest selectedIndex property.

The selectedIndex property returned 0 although no rows were selected.
