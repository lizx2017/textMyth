AdvancedDataGrid does not fire ITEM_EDIT_BEGIN properly
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Have a custom editor inside AdvancedDataGrid like a TextInput, enter some value
2. Select the text but release the mouse outside the TextInput, AdvancedDataGridEvent.ITEM_EDIT_BEGIN will be fired (on mouseDown)
3. Now move the focus out of the datagrid, repeat step 2, this time ITEM_EDIT_BEGIN will only be fired if the mouse is released within the TextInput

AdvancedDataGridEvent.ITEM_EDIT_BEGIN get fire on text selection even if release the mouse outside
Workaround (if any):
