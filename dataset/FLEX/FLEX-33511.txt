Summary:
Flex with Web services
Description:
In my Project , there is a one requirement to connect Flex with Dot net 4.0 web services using SOAP 1.2 protocol , I tried using some link I have to come to know that , Flex does not supprot SOAP 1.2 protocol , so dot net 4.0 version web services is not compatible with Flex SOAP protocol ?
Is there is any Apache Flex SDK which support the dot net version web services above framework 4 and above ?
Is there is any way to connet Flex with Dot net Remote Object without using any third party tool ?
