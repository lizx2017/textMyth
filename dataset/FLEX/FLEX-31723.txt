Summary:
When the disabledRanges or disabledDays property of a DateTimeAxis is set, the values along the x-axis are compressed
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a chart with a DateTimeAxis. Observe that the minimum value is at the left of the chart, the maximum is at the right.
2. Exclude a range of dates from the chart
Actual Results:
The last data point in the chart is not positioned at the right-hand edge of the chart, but somewhere in the middle.
Expected Results:
The last data point in the chart should be at the extreme right.
