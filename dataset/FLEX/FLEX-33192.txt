Summary:
EMailValidator doesn't exclude hyphens at the beginning and end of domain names
Description:
E-Mail addresses like test@online.de or test@online.net aren't allowed and often misspelled by users (for example with an e-mail of the german provider t-online.de).
To fix it change the line 246 of the EMailValidator from:
if (domain.charAt(0) == ".")
to
if (domain.charAt(0) == "." || domain.charAt(0) == "" || domain.charAt(periodPos - 1) == "")
