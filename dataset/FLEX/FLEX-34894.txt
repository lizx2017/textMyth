Summary:
AdvancedDataGrid iconFunction doesn't work with ArrayCollection as dataProvider
Description:
The iconFunction works when the dataProvider for the ADG is a GroupingCollection2 which has a ArrayCollection as source.
The iconFunction doesn't work when the dataProvider for the ADG is a ArrayCollection.
The ASDocs say:
"The <mx:AdvancedDataGrid> tag inherits all of the tag attributes of its superclass, except for labelField, iconField, and iconFunction, and adds the following tag attributes:"
But in the FlashBuilder the code completion works for iconField and iconFunction. Maybe the docs are la little bit wrong?
In my attached example, you can see the iconFunction works when the dataProvider is a GroupingCollection2. Maybe it also work, when the dataProvider is a ArrayCollection.
