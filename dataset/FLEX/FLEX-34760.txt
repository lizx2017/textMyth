Summary:
DataGrid selectionIndicator doesn't draw stroke color correctly
Description:
If you modify the DataGridSkin to add a stroke to the selectionIndicator, no matter what color you give the stroke, it renders as a blue-ish/purple stroke.
Add the below code right after the <s:Fill> in the selectionIndicator skin part of the DataGridSkin. It should render an orange stroke, but it renders a blue stroke instead.
<s:stroke>
<s:SolidColorStroke color="#F7931D"/>
</s:stroke>
