Summary:
programatically scrolling(and also manual) the ODG corrupts the row headers indentation
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. run the bug file
2. click on gender vs martial status button
3. click on scroll button
Actual Results:
indentation is messed up. "Female" is at same level as "All"
Expected Results:
Indentation should not change it should behave
This is typical case when there is a position when nodes at some sub level start at the ADG row set. So calculation based on previous node fails.
