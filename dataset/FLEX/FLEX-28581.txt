Summary:
Popup created with modal effect, but can still operate anything behind the popup
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run the attached FXP (PopUpTest.fxp)
2. Click the button to minimise the app and start the timer, after which a popup is opened with a modal effect
3. After a few seconds, maximise the app window
Actual Results:
Popup appears in top-left corner (not centered as per the code) without a modal effect. If you drag the popup into the centre of the app, notice the button is blurred and clickable.
Expected Results:
Popup is centered, full modal effect is visible and anything behind the popup cannot be operated.
Workaround (if any):
See PopUpTest_WA.fxp
