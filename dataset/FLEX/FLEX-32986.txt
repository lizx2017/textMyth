Summary:
Unwanted mouse rollout event
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
For items displayed at the bottom of an advanced data grid, if the mouse is moving over the item from left to right, roll_out event will be triggered a couple of times even before the mouse leaves the border of the item.
Workaround (if any):
It works fine for items not at the bottom, or if the mouse is moving over the item from right to left.
