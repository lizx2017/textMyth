Summary:
Views are not initially sized properly if stage is locked and orientation changed
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create an application that supports auto-orientation, and display a view in portrait orientation
<autoOrients>true</autoOrients>
2. Push a view and disable auto-orientation and alters orientation:
stage.autoOrients=false;
stage.setAspectRatio(StageAspectRatio.LANDSCAPE);
3. The view when drawn will initially be portrait sized and will then resize
I've put together a simple application to demonstrate this, the simulator behaves as expected but once on a device the error can be seen.
1. Launch application
2. With the phone in a portrait orientation select "Push Landscape View" (Landscape to Portrait) may not show the error as easily since the new view is narrower than the old
3. The new view when drawn will initially be portrait sized and will then resize
Actual Results:
The view when drawn will initially be portrait sized and will then resize
Expected Results:
The view would come in appropriately sized
