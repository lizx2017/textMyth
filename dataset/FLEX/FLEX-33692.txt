Summary:
Spark button border issue
Description:
Noticed an issue with spark.component.Button with Flex 4.10.
The border of the button is bigger than the inside/clickable area of the button.
Border stretches beyond the top-right, bottom-left and bottom-right corner.

This is how I have defined the button component in my project;
<s:View xmlns:fx="http://ns.adobe.com/mxml/2009"
xmlns:s="library://ns.adobe.com/flex/spark" title="HomeView">
<s:Button label="Submit"/>
</s:View>
This issue happens only when deploying a mobile application in a device with PPI 441, I used Samsung Galaxy S4 for my testing and it got an PPI of 441. Issue can be reproduced in AIR Emulator with PPI set to 441.
Issue doesn't happen when application is deployed to devices with PPI's lesser/equal to 320.
Issue doesn't happen with <mx:Button> irrelevant of device PPI.
