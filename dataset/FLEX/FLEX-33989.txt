Summary:
ViewNavigatorBase discards MultiDPIBitmapSource information for icon when saving and re-loading view data
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
Create a TabbedViewNavigatorApplication with applicationDPI set to 160 dpi
Add a couple of ViewNavigator that have a MultiDPIBitmapSource as icon, and add icons for another resolution, e.g. 320 dpi
Run on a device with that higher resolution
Result: higher resolution icons will be loaded and displayed in the proper scale
Stop the application and reload it
Result: higher resolution icons will be loaded but not scaled properly, so they appear too large and with low resolution
Root cause: ViewNavigatorBase discards the MultiDPIBitmapSource information in saveViewData() and instead only saves the high resolution bitmap. After re-loading in ViewNavigatorBase.loadViewData(), only the bitmap is restored without the DPI information. Hence, BitmapImage etc. don't have sufficient information to properly scale the image, see BitmapImage.measure()
