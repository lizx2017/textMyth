Summary:
CLONE -filterData property Kills Data Tips
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1.showDataTips to the line chart show normally
chart.showDattips = true;
2. but when you make filterData to false on one of the LineSerie
lineSeries.filterData = false;
3. It kills data tips for this series
Actual Results:
Datatips won't come up if you make lineSeries.filterData = false
Expected Results:
Datatips should come up even though lineSeries.filterData = false
Workaround (if any):
Extend the LineSeries class. Override the findDataPoitns function. In its body, paste a copy of that from the original LineSeries class. Change the if (!isNaN(v.yFilter) && !isNaN(v.xFilter)) to if (!isNaN(v.yNumber) && !isNaN(v.xNumber)). Replace all _renderData references with just renderData.
