Summary:
The collectionChangeHandler code in ADG is executed twice when the DataProvider is an IHierarchicalCollectionView
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
When using an IHierarchicalCollectionView the dataProvider property is set in commitProperties of the ADG.
On line 2120 of ADG.commitProperties it calls AdvancedListBase.dataProvider as follows:
super.dataProvider = hierarchicalCollectionInstance;
In AdvancedListBase on line 1669 of the dataProvider setter it adds an EventListener to the hierarchicalCollectionInstance using AdvancedListBase.collectionChangeHandler as the handler.
Then back in commitProperties of ADG on line 2121 it also adds an EventListener to the hierarchicalCollectionInstance using the overriden ADG.collectionChangeHandler as the handler.
The becuase the two handlers functions are different (one is overridden) the result is there are therefore two handlers for all CollectionChangeEvents and therefore all the code is executed twice impacting performance and potentialy giving unexpected results in subclasses
Same happens for IHierarchicalData, the corresponding lines being
2130/2133 of ADG.commitProperties
Actual Results:
The collectionChangeHandler code is executed twice
Expected Results:
The collectionChangeHandler code is executed once
