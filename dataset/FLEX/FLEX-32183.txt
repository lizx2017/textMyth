Summary:
dataFunctions for series and categories skew data with non-unique field values
Description:
It seems that the label value returned for the category axis is used as unique idendifier in a hash lookup rather than using some UID of the data object source. The problem is that if there are items with the same label the data is skewed. This does NOT happen if the categoryFIeld, xField and yField properties are used. Please see the attached file tor example of how to reproduce.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Open the attached project file
2. Run
3. Note the 3 grids. The first uses the field properties, while the second (broken) uses the dataFunctions to retrieve the same information from the same data source. The third shows what happens if unique label values are used by appending the UID of source data object to the label, this returns the same result as grid 1.
Actual Results:
Data element points on grid are skewed and placed ontop of each other
Expected Results:
chart should be able to correctly resolve the relationship and propertly place element points even if label values are the same, just like when using the field properties.
Workaround (if any):
only to change the data so all items have unique labels
