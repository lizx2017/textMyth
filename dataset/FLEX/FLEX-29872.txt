Summary:
SWLLoader numAutomationChildren inconsistent behaviour depending on the directory location of SWF file being loaded
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Import and compile attached two projects in Flex Builder.
2. Run Loader application. By default TextInput will contain "../../Loadable/bin-debug/Loadable.swf" correct path to Loadable.swf. Click Load button. Loadable.swf application will be loaded and "Loadable Button" will appear.
3. Click Refresh button. numAutomationChildren will show 1 as expected (The only child of SWFLoader is loaded Loadable application).
4. Close Loader application.
5. Copy "Loadable.swf" to some other directory, e.g C:\ root directory.
6. Run Loader application.
7. This time in TextInput field specify C:\Loadable.swf new location.
8. Click Load button. Loadable.swf application will be loaded and "Loadable Button" will appear.
9. Click Refresh button. numAutomationChildren will show 0. This is wrong.
NOTE: You may need to try different directories in step 5. The problem is highly dependent on the directory. I was unable to figure out any correlation between directories and problem appearance. Some directories just work, some others fail. The problem never appears when both Loader.swf and Loadable.swf are located in the same directory.
Actual Results:
numAutomationChildren value is inconsistent and depends on the directory where loading SWF is located.
Expected Results:
numAutomationChildren must show 1 no matter what directory is Loadable.swf loaded from.
