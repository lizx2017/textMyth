Summary:
OLAPSet.crossJoin implementation isn't iterative and may cause scriptTimeoutError with complex cubes
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Compile and execute the attached OlapTimeoutTest.mxml application
Actual Results:
On my machine (a Pentium4 @ 2.6Ghz) a ScriptTimeoutError will be thrown during the crossJoin phase (due to the 60sec hardcoded timeout), with faster CPUs you may need to increase the number of rows in the cube dataProvider.
Note that, in a real application I have a cube with 15000 source rows and many dimensions, and a single crossJoin between two dimension attributes is enough to trigger the timeout.
I think that the iterative implementation used for cube building and for query execution should be used also for the crossJoin operation to avoid this issue.
Expected Results:
No error.
Workaround (if any):
None.
