Summary:
Calling invalidateList on focusOut event from a ComboBox as an itemEditor by hitting Enter key causes AdvancedDataGrid corrupt rendering.
Description:
Calling invalidateList on focusOut event from a ComboBox as an itemEditor by hitting Enter key causes AdvancedDataGrid corrupt rendering. It doesn't occur if you don't scroll to see the column of ComboBox. e.g. running this app on a wide-screen monitor.
Reproducible with Flex SDK 3.5a on Windows XP/Vista and Mac OS 10.6. Cannot reproduce with SDK 4.1 (Flex 3 compatibility mode), but ComboBox doesn't work correctly due to SDK-26940.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run attached file.
2. Scroll right until you see the Column 12 (ComboBox).
3. Click any row on the Column 12 (ComboBox).
4. Hit Enter key.
Actual Results:
It causes AdvancedDataGrid corrupt rendering.
Expected Results:
Rendering should not corrupt.
Workaround (if any):
Use itemEditEnd instead of focusOut.
