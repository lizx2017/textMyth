Summary:
CLicks on Spark form are recorded inconsistently. The clicks on the spark form items are ignored.
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a Flex project with the attached mxml
2. Start recording in qtp.
3. Click on the first form(spark form) and the form items.
Actual Results:
Sometimes, the click on form is recognized and sometimes it is not recorded at all.
Clicking on the form item ignores the click totally.
The individual components like label, button inside the form are recognized properly.
Expected Results:
The mx form component doesnt record click on the form. All clicks on the form are recorded as click on the parent. Also, The formitems of mx form are ignored while recording.
From user perspective, i think a click on the form itself might not be needed at all, so we can implement the behavior of the mx form in the spark form.
