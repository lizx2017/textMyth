Summary:
Cannot set minimum/maximum properties of DateTimeAxis to null programmatically
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
Consider a control like this:
<mx:ColumnChart dataProvider="
{dp}
" series="
{chartSeries}
">
<mx:horizontalAxis>
<mx:DateTimeAxis id="dateAxis" labelUnits="days" minimum="
{null}" />
</mx:horizontalAxis>
</mx:ColumnChart>

Obviously the minimum="{null}
" attribute is redundant, since it is the default.
Now, image you've set a different miniumum via ActionScript, and then wish to clear it again... you would call:
dateAxis.minimum = null;
However, that throws a null access exception, since the public setter functions for minimum and maximum both immediately try to access the value's getTime() method. They should perform a null check first, and treat that case differently.
