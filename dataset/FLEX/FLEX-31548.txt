Summary:
Querying a cube processes lot of invalid tuples. This causes huge time for query to return result
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. notice the difference in number of cells processed in one query during first round and second round or alternatively run bug file and observer progress bar in any query selected from combobox
Actual Results:
a huge number of invalid tuples are processed in first round. for instance around 1lakh 56 thousand are processed in first round out of which only 18 thousand or valid tuples. This behavior can be seen when u select second item form combobox in bug file
Expected Results:
Cube should not spend time in processing/analyzing invalid tuple cells.
