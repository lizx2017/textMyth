Summary:
Editable Advanced Data Grid issues with Jaws 9
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run attached application with Jaws 9 (with scripts installed)
2.Let Jaws 9 attempt to read ADG
3.Press tab to navigate through data grid
*Using ADG with selectionMode = singleRow and editable = true, with custom item renderer for one column*
Actual Results:
ADG is read in its entirety upon load, but it is read incorrectly. Row # is read at incorrect times, column names are read multiple times
ADG is read twice, if you do not interrupt the reading by tabbing into grid
Jaws does not read combobox value as it reads through application with forms mode on
Jaws does not read combobox value as user tabs to combobox field
Cannot consistently move between forms mode on and off
When in forms mode off, Jaws reads and repeats rows and columns
When arrow keys can be used to change combobox, Jaws does not read the new choice
Expected Results:
ADG should be read once upon loading, row by row, including combobox value
When tabbing to field, Jaws should read field (header and value, perhaps)
When tabbing to combobox, Jaws should read combobox value and/or choices
When changing combobox value, Jaws should read selected combobox value
If user is forced to go into or out of forms mode due to ADG, that should be VERY clear and should be VERY easy to move into or out of
NOTE:
**Would like to see updated information on Adobe's proposed editable ADG keyboard navigation and screen reader functionality, as existing Adobe keyboard navigation and screen reader functionality does not seem to apply to editable ADG.
