Summary:
Issue with combination of charts ( Column + Line)
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. I have a combination of charts ( 2 column series and 3 line series )
2. I have created a columnset for the first 2 column series and made it stacked and then I have 3 line series.
3. So, on the screen I will be seeing 2 column series stacked and 3 line series on the same chart.
Now I have a combo box containing all the options available on the chart. I will select some value from the combo box, and I should be able to see only that series chart and not the others.
I am also able to achieve this.
I am facing an issue when I have selected a line series chart from combo and then I tried to select ALL to view the complete original chart. I have provided data to chart.series properly.
But still I am not able to see that on the screen. It is showing me the previous selected options data on the screen.
All of this is working fine if I dont create a column set and make my column series as stacked.
I would like to know if this is a known issue in Flex 3. I have not yet tried this in Flex 4.
Workaround (if any): I am trying to get the workaround for this yet.
Prompt help will be very much appreciated
