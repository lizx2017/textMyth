Summary:
Back Button Returns to previous app rather than popping the View
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create an Android App with at least 2 views
2. In the second view have at least on TextInput
3. Have the first view push the second view
4. Run the app on the device
5. Push the button to open the second view
6. Click on the TextInput as if you were to type something
7. Hit the back button to hide the keyboard (note that focus remains in the text input)
8. Hit the back button again.
Actual Results:
Android returns to the previous App.
Expected Results:
The Second View should be popped, and the first view should show.
Workaround (if any):
Tap the view (anywhere but the text input) prior to hitting the back button and the Second View will be popped.
Notes:
This appears to be a focus issue, as if when the view does not have the focus it will return to the previous App. I have encountered this issue in more complex scenarios but using the TextInput is an easy way to recreate the issue.
I'm attaching a simple project that recreates the issue as explained above.
