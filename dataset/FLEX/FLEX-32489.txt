Summary:
Tree scrolling behaves very erratically and corrputs view
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Lazy load some nodes on a tree and try scrolling up down
2. See video and attached project for details
Actual Results:
Child nodes appear with different parents,
Nodes are missing
Scroll bar is not synced up with the actual # of nodes, bar is 90% high when only about 20% of items are shown on screen.
Expected Results:
Child nodes should appear with correct parents and nodes shouldn't get lost when you scroll.
Workaround (if any): None
Like one of the closed bugs suggested, tried to explicitly collapse open items before lazy load and expand items after query but that has just as many bugs. Scroll position would get lost, all nodes would appear to be missing (tree was blank) but tree would have a correct scroll bar that would eventualy refresh it once you scrolled up/down enough time. Will attach another project with what happen with that 'workaround'.
This was found in Flex 3.1 but might have been there earlier, it affects all milestones and minor builds since at least that time and has not been fixed in any of them.
Found a number of older closed bugs related to this, clearly this isn't resolved.
