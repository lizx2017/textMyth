Summary:
ColumnChartSeries do not show up when a displayed ColumnChart (having type != default) is removed from a container via RemoveChild and re-added using the addChild method.
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a ColumnChart where type = 100% or clustered
2. Call RemoveChild on the Chart
3. Re-add the removed ColumnChart
(I've provided an example file that displays the problem in MXML and Actionscript).
Actual Results:
Series of the ColumnChart disappear
Expected Results:
ColumnChart with series should be visible
Workaround (if any):
Recreate the entire chart with actionscript? My guess is that the ColumnChart code drops a series referencey when its performing data aggregation. Although untested, I think the problem will be noticed with state changes. I've noticed it because I remove ColumnCharts from a single display and put them into a TabNavigator (multi-tab chart interface).
