Summary:
StageWebView fails on hyperlinks with target='_blank'
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Setup StageWebView in your flex-mobile project.
2. Use StageWebView.loadURL() method to load the URL with hyperlinks.
3. Tap or click on a hyperlink with the attribute: target='_blank'
Actual Results:
No Results.
There is no Error- or LOCATION_CHANGE / LOCATION_CHANGING Event dispatched.
Expected Results:
StageWebView should load or follow up the hyperlink-url.
Workaround (if any):
1. load the hyperlink-url via URLLoader.
2. parse the event.target.data as String and replace the value '_blank' of any "target"-attributes with "_self".
3. parse the modified String with StageWebView.loadString() method.
This workaround could be painfull when there're JavaScripts inside the html-page.
Also, during the String-modification you've to replace relative pathes with absolute ones.
I've tested this only on Android Devices (HTC & Samsung) and Desktop environments (Win/Mac).
