Summary:
BarSeries offset property not having impact on visualization
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Try to dynamically add (using actionscript) BarSeries and set their offset property to any of the valid values (-100 : 100)
2. The visualization of the Bar is always rendered in the center.
Actual Results:
Changing the offset property has no effect on the visualization.
Expected Results:
Changing the offset property has effect on the visualization, according to the supplied documentation (direct copy from flex 4.1 asdocs):
"Specifies how far to offset the center of the bars from the center of the available space, relative the category width.
The range of values is a percentage in the range <code>-100</code> to <code>100</code>.
Set to <code>0</code> to center the bars in the space. Set to <code>-50</code> to center the column at the beginning of the available space. You typically do not set this property directly."
Workaround (if any): none found currently.
