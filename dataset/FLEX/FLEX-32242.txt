Summary:
use of "labelPosition" style of ColumnSeries in a CartesianChart throws exception
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. place a ColumnSeries within a CartesianChart - this is likely when creating multiple-series charts
2. set the "labelPosition" style of the ColumnSeries to "outside"
Actual Results:
a coercion error is thrown on chart generation
Expected Results:
The labels show be show outside the ColumnSeries.
Workaround (if any):
line 1299 in ColumnSeries.as assumes the parent chart is of type ColumnChart
workaround is to 1) not use the "labelPosition" style 2) extend ColumnSeries, override updateTransform() with an exception handler around the call to super.updateTransform()

A previous bug report about this issue has been closed and reported fixed. I am using the latest nightly build (3.2.0.2827), however, and I am still able to reproduce this issue! For this reason I cloned the previous bug report.
