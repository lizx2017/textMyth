Summary:
FB can't package project: Path to SDK must end with iPhoneOSx.x
Description:
Flash Builder 4.7 Apache Flex SDK 4.15.0 FP 23, AIR 23
I'm trying to build a project with 3rd party ANE's and when I try to build the project, I get the following error:
"The path to platform sdk should end with iPhoneOSx.x or iPhoneSimulatorx.x format to avoid any unintended behavior."
In Build Packaging, Apple iOS, SDK path I have: c:\iOS\iPhoneOS10.2 and it finds the path successfully. But when I build or try to debug, I get the error.
What is happening?
