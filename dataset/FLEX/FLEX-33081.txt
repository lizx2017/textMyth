Summary:
Build script assumes one playerglobal.swc for each flash player version
Description:
For released versions of the flags player this is fine. However for betas and release condidates multiple versions of the player global.swc may exist.
The build script needs:
1) Some way of targeting multiple playerglobal.swc for the same flash version
2) Downloads the right playerglobal.swc version if it does't exist
2) Uses the correct playerglobal.swc
Current if you want to switch from a beta to a RC to a released version the build script needs to be edited.
