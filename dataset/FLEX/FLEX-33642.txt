Summary:
Experimental Callout component frame always displays in black
Description:
The new experimental Callout button frame and arrow always display in black, and the color is not affected by chrome color.
This is not consistent with other spark components (such as Panel) which has gray borders by default.
Besides, it would be convenient to be able to set the borderColor through a style, instead of redefining the whole skin.
