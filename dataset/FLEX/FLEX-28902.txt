Summary:
StageText: iOS - app does not resize when in portrait mode
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Load sample application in landscape orientation.
2. Click "3. Display Long Text, Click to Edit"
3. Click the "Edit" button. Keyboard opens and app resizes.
4. Click the "Done" button.
5. Rotate to portrait.
6. Click the "Edit" button.
Actual Results:
App is not resized. Clicking the "Done" button also leaves the keyboard open and the keyboard cannot be closed until another text control is given focus.
Expected Results:
App should resize and keyboard should not remain open.
Workaround (if any):
Don't use application width/height to determine aspect ratio. Use stageWidth/stageHeight, or use the aspectRatio property on Application.
