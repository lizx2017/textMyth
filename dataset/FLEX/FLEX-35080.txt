Summary:
flex4.15.0-air21.0.0 ADT packaging time is impossible (over 10 minutes)
Description:
https://github.com/radistao/report-sdk-package-issue/
Looks like new version, flex4.15.0-air21.0.0 has a big problem with application packaging:
now adt package process takes more than 10 minutes where before was 1 minute.
At least such behavior when we package .exe or .ipa on Windows 7 machines.
I attached very simple demo project which includes only 1 button and Alert window. Also you can find sources here:
https://github.com/radistao/report-sdk-package-issue/
Build:
From project root directory:
new build which takes over 10 minutes to package exe:
$ ant -f build/build.xml build21
old build which takes less than 10 seconds:
$ ant -f build/build.xml build19
The only one difference on those builds - they use different SDKs: `flex4.14.1-air19.0.0` or `flex4.15.0-air21.0.0` (see build.properties file)
Conclusion:
This is lame: this really blocks us from development process, so, please, fix it.
