Summary:
AdvancedDataGridColumn.sortDescending always returns false.
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create an application with an AdvancedDataGrid and a set of AdvancedDataGridColumns (but a flat dataProvider, no GroupingCollection is necessary).
2. Write a method that will print (or trace) out the sortDescending values for each AdvancedDataGridColumn in the AdvancedDataGrid columns collection in response to event (like a button click).
3. Run the application and try tracing the sortDescending values after clicking on column headers to the sort the column. Even the column is sorted in descending order, sortDescending always shows false.
