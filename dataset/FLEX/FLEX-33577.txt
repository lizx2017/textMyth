Summary:
scrollToIndex produces errors if the index to scroll to is not visible in AdvancedDataGrid
Description:
Hello,
i created a custom column ADG where i import new data via BlazeDS. Normally the backing list contains 50 elements. All those Elements represent a dataset which i can load into a data view and than do some edits. For a better workflow i added a "done, save & next" button which changes the selected index to the next element of the ADG and loads it. To follow the selected item in the ADG i implemented the scrollToIndex function within that process. Now the behavior:
The scrollToIndex function does nothing while the slected indexes are in the visible part of the ADG. Once i reach an index of an element that is not visible yet the selectedIndex = selectedIndex + 1 produces the MinInteger Value because this next element isn't rendered yet. I made a workaround by forwarding the verticalScrolling by 1 element to surly render the next element but the scrollToIndex function produces massive errors (FlashPlayer produces 4GB memory usage and crashes the OS, shows exclamation mark error) when using it with that invalid index.
Is there a solution to render the next n elements in advance or to deactivate lazy rendering in ADG's.
