Summary:
QTP Flex plugin not working and insufficient troubleshooting documentation
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
I'm using QTP 10 on a Windows 2003 Enterprise Server. I'm using IE 7 (7.0.5730.13) Browser, with latest windows patches.
1. Installed debug version of Flash player 10.
2. Installed QTP Flex plugin obtained from https://www.adobe.com/cfusion/entitlement/index.cfm?event=custom&sku=FS0001526&e=flex4_automation_plugin
3. Rebooted the QTP client after plugin install.
3. Followed the instructions in https://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/pdfs/flex4_plug-in_hp_quicktest_professional.pdf
4. The QTP Flex plugin does not recognize any objects in Flex application. I have tried this with Adobe flex store also.

[Update: As of Sep 13 11:52 AM CST] when you browse to http://examples.adobe.com/flex2/inproduct/lcds/flexstore/flexstore.html, it gets redirected to http://www.adobe.com/devnet.html
So Flex store is gone ??
please note that our app is instrumented with Flex automation libraries and it used to work. It stopped working for some unknown reasons. I've hit a dead end troubleshooting this problem.
5. In http://help.adobe.com/en_US/Flex/4.0/TestingQTP/flex_4.0_testingqtp.pdf, trouble shooting section, it says
"Use the Process Explorer (found at http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/Processesandthreadsutilities.mspx) to find out whether TEAPluginIE.dll and TEAPluginQTP.dll are loaded. Search for these DLLs once you have started recording. If only TEAPluginQTP.dll is loaded and TEAPluginIE.dll is not loaded it might be a problem with IE security settings. TEAPluginIE exposes an ActiveX control that the QTP agent uses."
The document does not say what security setting in IE. I notice that TEAPluginIE.dll is not loaded. How do I fix this ?
How can make this plugin work with QTP so I can develop some automation ? PLease help!
Actual Results:
QTP Flex plugin does not detect any flex objects. No clear information on how to troubleshoot. Whatever information is available, does not really help in resolving this problem.
Expected Results:
QTP flex plugin should detect Flex apps. Trouble shooting documents very inadequate.
