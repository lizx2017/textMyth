Summary:
DropDownList Issues on Mobile
Description:
In Flash Builder 4.7, and designing for mobile iOS apps(paraticularly the iPad), the DropDownList behaves erratically.  If you tap on the DropDownList so that the list opens, and then flick your finger across the list, it scrolls just fine.
The problem arises when you put your finger on the list and then scroll slowly up or down the list.  When you release your finger from the list, wherever your finger was when you lift it gets selected every, single, time and the list closes. Once scrolling begins, you should not be able to select an item and close the list unless you tap the list a second time. Lifting your finger after scrolling should not result in a selection.
This leads to a bad user experience because the dropdownlist feels like it is randomly closing.  It is hard to scroll through moderate length lists.  If you flick the list it usually scrolls too far, if you then try to scroll more deliberately and exactly, the list closes before you get to the right item.  It feels way too hard to select the item that you want.
