Summary:
SkinnablePopUpContainer should use measuredHeight when soft keyboard is active in landscape then rotated to portrait
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run the attached project on an iPad
2. Rotate to landscape
3. Select Calloutbutton ViewNav
4. Click on "Resizable Callout"
5. Click on the TextInput to open the soft keyboard
6. Rotate to portrait
Actual Results:
Callout does not resize
Expected Results:
Callout should resize based on a new measuredHeight (via new explicitMaxHeight via calloutMaxHeight). The same steps going from portrait to landscape do not show any issues.
