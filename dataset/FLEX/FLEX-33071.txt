Summary:
DropdownList items dupplication => virtualLayout
Description:
I use skinned dropdown lists with a XMLListCollection as dataprovider
If I display 10 element from a list of 50 items when scrolling I will see all my items randomly mixed and repeated.
When I set useVirtualLayout to false the problem is resolved.
It may be a problem of cache management ?
