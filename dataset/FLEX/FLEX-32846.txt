Summary:
[Dependent][FP]AdvancedDataGrid shows wrong selection in FlashPlayer 10.1
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run the code ADGtest.mxml attached.
2. Select the first row of cells in the datagrid.
3. Click on the down arrow on the datagrid scrollbar to scroll down one row.
Can reproduce on windows and OSX and tested with both Flex SDK 4.0 and 4.1. In all cases it works as expected in FlashPlayer 10.0 but displays incorrectly in FlashPlayer 10.1.
Just about any selection of multiple cells will show the same issue in FlashPlay 10.1. Selection of a single cell doesn't seem to cause the issue.
Actual Results:
Works in Flash player 10.0 and shows no cells selected. In Flash Player 10.1 two cells are show selected. See ADGbug10.tiff and ADGbug101.tiff attached.
Expected Results:
No Cells should show selected in Flash Player 10.1
Workaround (if any):
None.
