Summary:
AIR Plugin:No synchronisation between flex app and QTP
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1.Run the attached mxml file
2.Click on Recrod in QTP and
3.Click on the Flextree component within the ADG and expand the tree Southwest->Arizona->Southwest.
4.Now replay the script.
Actual Results:During replay QTP does not wait for the first node to complete expand before it moves to the next line of script that way the script passes but the tree is not completely expanded
Expected Results:The flex tree should be completely expanded on replay.
Workaround (if any):Add a random wait before the steps.
