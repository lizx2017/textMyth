Summary:
Invalid implementation of drawColumnBackground function in AdvancedDataGridBaseEx.as
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Open mx.controls.AdvancedDataGridBaseEx.as
2. Goto line #3937 (drawColumnBackground function)
// Height is usually as tall is the items in the row, but not if
// it would extend below the bottom of listContent
var height:Number = Math.min(lastRow.y + lastRow.height,
listContent.height - yy);
3. Check a next implementation line #3940
g.drawRect(xx, yy, headerInfo.headerItem.width,
listContent.height - yy);
Why we are calculate a height of DataGrid if we are not using that variable?
Workaround (if any):
Override completely that function
