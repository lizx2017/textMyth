Make Linux a supported platform
Description:
Make Linux a supported platform.
Currently you can take the OSX or windows binary and with a few minor config changes and the correct versions of playerglobal.swc and AIR use the Flex SDK on Linux. Would be more convenient for Linux users if Apache Flex was fully supported on Linux.
