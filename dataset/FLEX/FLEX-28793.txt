Summary:
SlideViewTransition causes a white background to be drawn during a ViewTransition when the View's skin draws a custom background
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run the attached project
2. Press button on the first view
Actual Results:
A white background appears during the transition
Expected Results:
No white rectangle
Workaround (if any):
The workaround would be to set backgroundAlpha or opaqueBackground of the View to a non-zero value. Since these values aren't set, SlideViewTransition makes the bad assumption that the background is opaque and sets an opaqueBackground. This was to improve framerates on android devices.
