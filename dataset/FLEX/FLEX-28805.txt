Summary:
Tree Drop Targets Not Available After Expanded Nodes
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Compile and Run attached program.
2. Expand A, B, C, and D.
3. Drag and Drop E immediately after B, C or D in one drag and drop.
Actual Results:
Cannot get a drop target after B, C or D.
Expected Results:
Can get a drop target anywhere, except inside leaf nodes.
Workaround (if any):
Node to move must not be in the destination tree structure. The desired node to follow must be collapsed. Then a drop target is available.
If node to move is in the destination tree structure, it must be moved out. This "two-step" (plus collapsing) is highly undesirable since each move has consequences in a real application (such as logging, notifications, etc.) â€“ it does not represent the intent but a work around.
Additional Details:
Demonstrated in Flash Player 10 from Flex SDK 4.5.1.
I assume all OSs may be affected.
Code based upon help.adobe.com 4.5 example adding data and height/width 100%.
