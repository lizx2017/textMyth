To start with, I was using the following method to generate RichText's textflow from a String in the renderer:
TextConverter.importToFlow(data.questionStatement, TextConverter.TEXT_LAYOUT_FORMAT);
But the embedded images in textflow wouldn't print.

I was told that you need to hand BitMap to a textflow in a renderer for it to print because the image needs to be loaded before making a call to
printJob.addObject(thePrintView);
So, I loaded all the images in advance, created all the textflow objects and assigned them to a value object variable that the renderer uses to bind to RichText's textflow.
But in this case, I've experienced all sorts of issues depending on the data, number of pages in the printout, etc.
I've hosted one such at the following link where second row of every page skips printing image that inside a textflow:

I've struggled on this issue for the last one-and-a-half months and will be able to provide more details as needed.
