Summary:
Font styles are not being passed from Legend to LegendItem children
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create chart + Legend
2. Set the fontSize of the Legend - either on the <mx:Legend> tag or via styles.
Actual Results:
fontSize (or family or weight) is ignored.
Expected Results:
fontSize inherited (or passed) from Legend to LegendItem children.
Workaround (if any):
Use a Style and set the styles for LegendItem explicitly.
Notes:
It was possible to set the fontSize on <mx:Legend> in Flex 2. You can also set fontSize on Tile or HBox containers and the styles are passed to their children. If Legend is based on Tile, then it should do the same.
