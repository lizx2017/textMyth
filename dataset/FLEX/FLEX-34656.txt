Summary:
Incorrect NetStream states are corrupting OSMF 2.0 based VideoPlayers with local video files on iOS
Description:
Problem Description:
Video player which are based on OSMF 2.0 will struggle about misleading NetStream states when StageVideo is used and the following options are true:
autoDisplayFirstFrame
and / or
autoPlay
Steps to Reproduce:
1) Setup a project with a OSMF 2.0 or Flex SDK VideoDisplay / VideoPlayer based VideoPlayers
2) activate StageVideo
3) enable autoDisplayFirstFrame and / or autoPlay
4) Try to play a local mp4 file
Actual Result:
The NetStream object will reach this states:
NetStream.Play.Start
NetStream.Buffer.Full
NetStream.Play.Failed
This happens because the VideoDisplay / video Object will switch between stageVideo and software fallback
Expected Result:
The NetStream-Object should reach this states:
NetStream.Play.Start
NetStream.Buffer.Full
etc.
Any Workarounds:
Disable autoDisplayFirstFrame, autoPlay wait until the netStream is attached to the stageVideo-Object and start the playback afterwards.
By the way:
Playback via a progressive HTTP-Download is possible without any problem.
