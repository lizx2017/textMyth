Summary:
FlexJSStore and FlexJSStore_JQuery fail with javascript error on starting as of 09 DEC
Description:
I had check out last code freshly at 09 DEC, the SDK build fine and it work for simple FlexJS application, but FlexJSStore and FlexJSStore_JQuery could not start, they failed with javascript error on starting:
EventDispatcher.js:70 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'price' of undefined
I believe FlexJSStore was mostly working in earlier 0.8 code, it can start, do basic operations but it crush if I click controls faster. I can't reproduce crushing on mouse clicking now since it can't start
FlexJSStore_JQuery was mostly working in earlier 0.8 code, it can start but it crush if I click controls faster and the JQuery buttons had some strange UI interaction behaviors: for example button can get larger when I move mouse around. I can't reproduce the problems now since it can't start
If they can start I will retest and include more test results of FlexJSStore and FelxJSStore_JQuery problems (when they could start)
