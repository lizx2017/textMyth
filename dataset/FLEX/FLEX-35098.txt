Summary:
OSMF missing from 4.14.1 - VIdeoDisplay not working
Description:
In the pre-Apache Flex releases, you could use <s:VideoDisplay> to play a local video on a mobile device.
In the Apache releases, it appears that the OSMF libraries have been removed from the SDK rendering the VIdeoDisplay component nonfunctional.
I have tried copying the osmf.swf and projects/osmf folder from Adobe's Flex release to Apache's (as advised in case FLEX-34754 - but it still doesn't work.
What is the best way to play video on a mobile device with AIR?
