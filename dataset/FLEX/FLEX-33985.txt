Summary:
[TLF] Pressing BACKSPACE key when editing a TextInput deletes a whole line
Description:
When editing a spark TextInput or TextFlow (problem should exist with TextArea as well but I didn't test), BACKSPACE key behaves incorrectly and delete the current line (if multiple lines) or the whole text instead of the previous character only.
When application is compiled with a previous version of the SDK, there is no issue (at least with 4.9 and 4.10)
Steps to reproduce:
Add a TextInput to the stage and set its direction to RTL
Type in some text
Hit the BACKSPACE key to delete the last entered character
Result:
The last line of text is deleted
Expected result:
Only the last character is deleted
