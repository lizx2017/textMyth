Summary:
Member of row axis are wrongly displayed in OLAPDataGrid when dimensions are crossjoined
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a simple OLAPCube with at least 2 dimensions
2. Execute an OLAPQuery that return at least 300 rows against the cube crossjoining two dimensions on the row axis
3. Set the vertical position of the OLAPDataGrid control programmatically on a row that exceeds the visible area of the grid (using verticalScrollPosition or firstVisibleItem properties) and scroll vertically up or down by few rows - OR - Scroll vertically and quickly the OLAPDataGrid up and down a few times
Actual Results:
Labels of first dimension's members on row axis start to get misplaced and repeated.
Expected Results:
Labels are correctly displayed.
Workaround (when programmatically set the vertical position):
Incrementally set the OLAPDataGrid.verticalScrollPosition value until it reach the position to display:
[code]
for (var i:Number = 0; i <= 100; i++) {
olapDataGrid.verticalScrollPosition = i;
}
[/code]
However, this code is really slow to be executed.
Workaround (when scrolling manually up and down):
