Summary:
Object spy is very slow on any real-world app
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create an app with a decent about of display objects
2. Run QTP
3. Use object spy
Actual Results:
Sit and wait and wait and wait (a minute or more)
Expected Results:
No waiting
The problem is in AutomationManager.compositeAnalysis. Problem 1 - it's a loop in a loop (exponential order or something like that), problem 2 - it computes the same thing over and over if caching isn't on.
Caching (incrementCacheCounter/decrementCacheCounter) should be turned on for any and all operation QTP can invoke in AutomationManager.
