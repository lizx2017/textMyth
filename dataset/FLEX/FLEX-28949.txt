Summary:
Resetting the dataProvider when using itemRendererFunction and useVirtualLayout=false is now broken
Description:
This is a regression after fixing SDK-27727
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run the sample app
2. Click the button to change the dataprovider
Actual Results:
The new set of items will re-use the old item renderers (shown as "Item Renderer One")
Expected Results:
With the new data in place, itemRendererFunction() should be called and the second item renderer should be returned for those particular items
Workaround (if any):
Set useVirtualLayout = true or run with 4.5.x SDK
