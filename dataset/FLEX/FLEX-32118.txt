Summary:
Candlestick chart not rendering correctly when using negative values
Description:
We've identified a problem w/ the HLOC/Candlestick chart where the chart doesn't show up w/ any glyphs.
We found this problem while working on a boxplot chart which has a BoxplotSeries class that extends from the CandlestickSeries.
The bug occurs whenever you have a candlestick chart where you have only 1 glyph data from the dataprovider and its value is negative. In this scenario, the chart axis cannot determine the correct range to set the axis and thus, it appears to default to the axis range to 0 to 100. If the glyph data values aren't in that default range, the glyph doesn't show up. We believe that the bug is in the Series class.The expected result is that the axis should determine its correct range so that the glyph will be able to show up. The Column chart appears to exhibit this same behavior where if you have 1 glyph and the value is negative, then the glyph doesn't appear as well.Examples are attached.
