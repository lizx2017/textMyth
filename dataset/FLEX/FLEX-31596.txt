Summary:
comparefunction on a GroupingField does not seem to work
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Specify a comparefunction on a GroupingField or Grouping
2. Set descending=true or false
Actual Results:
There is no difference in the way data is sorted if comparefunction is specified or not
Expected Results:
It is not clear whether the comparefunction is supposed to sort grouped nodes or leaf nodes. We need to either document this or change the function name to match what it is expected to do.
Also sortComparefunction on an ADG column is not as easy to write as the DG one since it takes grouped collections of different height. We need samples/doc or a different way to write sortCompareFunction on ADG columns
