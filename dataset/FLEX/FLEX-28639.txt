Summary:
List stops working after holding device near 45 degree angle
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a list with enough items to scroll.
2. Continually do throws while changing the angle of the phone between 0 and 45 degrees
Actual Results:
Eventually, the list will get stuck with only a few renderers showing. Debugging in, it looks like the cache (llv) is null, so layout doesn't run.

normal List
