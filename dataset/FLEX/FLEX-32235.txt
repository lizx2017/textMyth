Summary:
Advanced Datagrid - Column backgrounds are not contiguous
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run the attached application
2. Move the slider to vary the width of the advanced data grid
Actual Results:
Gaps are visible between column backgrounds at particular widths
Expected Results:
The column backgrounds should display black with no gaps between columns
Workaround (if any):
Override the drawColumnBackground method to redraw background rectangles using the width of the corresponding column header renderer for each column. This workaround may won't work in all situations.
