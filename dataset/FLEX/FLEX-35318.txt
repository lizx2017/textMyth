Summary:
[MDL] Components loosing default css style once they pass through native MDL library upgrade
Description:
Each component in FlexJS including those from MDL library has his own default css class. Through css class we can apply to component some default behavior using classes like Beads, Models, Controllers or apply some initial style.
Example of default CSS class for MDL List:
List
{
    IBeadView: ClassReference("org.apache.flex.mdl.beads.views.ListView");
    IBeadModel: ClassReference("org.apache.flex.html.beads.models.ArraySelectionModel");
    IBeadLayout: ClassReference(null); 
    IDataProviderItemRendererMapper: ClassReference("org.apache.flex.html.beads.DataItemRendererFactoryForArrayData");
    IItemRendererClassFactory: ClassReference("org.apache.flex.core.ItemRendererClassFactory");
    IItemRenderer: ClassReference("org.apache.flex.mdl.itemRenderers.ListItemRenderer");
}
Created List in MXML or AS code should have in HTML assigned css class "List".
Pseudo code:
<div class="List"></div>
Unfortunately Native MDL library components has special life cycles which they are pass through once component is placed in HTML DOM. - I will call it "Upgrading".
In the results of upgrading component in HTML code look a bit different than we did create it in AS code. It can gets additional container etc. Once such List pass through "Upgrading" it does not have their default style.
As part of this jira I'm going to fix this issue implementing mechanism which assign default css style class once component finish upgrading.
