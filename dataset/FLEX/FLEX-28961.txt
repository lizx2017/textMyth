Summary:
DataGrid displays empty rows when jump-scrolling over page boundary.
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a DataGrid with a lazily loaded data provider.
2. Scroll down far enough that clicking below the thumb will bring the next page into view.
3. Click once below the thumb on the scrollbar.
OR
1. Run DataGridBug.swf
2. Click below the thumb on the scrollbar of the first data grid. (The second grid is customized to get around the bug.)
Actual Results:
Nothing is displayed where items from the lazily-loaded page should appear.
Expected Results:
The lazily-loaded page of items should appear automatically.
Workaround (if any):
Scroll again after the page is loaded.
OR
Extend DataGrid and monkey around with makeRows to add item responders where there are none.
It appears that this bug is a result of the following lines being commented out of mx DataGridBase.makeRows:
//AJH commented out to fix one bug. We'll see if it causes others
//lastSeekPending = new ListBaseSeekPending(CursorBookmark.CURRENT, 0)
//e.addResponder(new ItemResponder(seekPendingResultHandler, seekPendingFailureHandler,
// lastSeekPending));
