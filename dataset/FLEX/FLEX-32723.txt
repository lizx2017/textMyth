Summary:
OLAPQuery returns wrong OLAPResult when OLAPCube's dataProvider contains Numeric type values in field referenced by OLAPAttribute
Description:
The problem takes place when an OLAPCube is assigned a dataProvider which contains values of Numeric type in a field used by an OLAPAttribute.
Tried using a custom dataFunction as a work around, to return the "toString" of the value in the current rowData. Even though the Result is closer to the expected, it still is not the same as when all attributes are Strings.
Another work around would be to use only String type values in dataProviders used in OLAPCubes, but in my case data is loaded from the server using XML and the parser automatically converts pure numbers to numeric types.
TESTING EXAMPLE:
The attached files are the test I carried out to isolate the problem. The data set is just a small table consisting of 3 columns: brand, variable and measure. They are mapped into a simple schema:
2 Dimensions: Brand and Variables
1 Measure
The OLAPQuery is defined to create an OLAPResult containing the Brand in the Row Axis and Variables in the Column Axis.
The application lets you choose the source of the data:
ArrayCollection: defined inline.
XML File: files data.xml and dataNoNumber.xml. They are identical except the numeric values have been preceded by characters.
There are two Load buttons that load data into the OLAPCube, execute the OLAPQuery and load the OLAPResult into the OLAPDataGrid:
Load Data with numeric Attribute Member, loads either:
ArrayCollection containing Number type values in the brand field
XML FIle containing only numbers, no characters, in the brand field
Load Data NO numeric Attribute Member, loads either:
ArrayCollection containing Strings in the brand field
XML File containing numbers preceded by characters in the brand field
Finally there's a RadioButton to choose to use a custom dataFunction on the OLAPAttributes defined or not.
STEPS TO SEE THE PROBLEM:
1. Open application.
2. Press "Load Data NO numeric Attribute". Data will be loaded and displayed as it should be seen, only difference is Brand "51" has been changed into "AB51".
3. Press "Load Data with numeric Attribute Member". Notice how one of the variables is no longer displayed (there's 2 columns instead of 3) and the values for the rows underneath brand "51" have lost their values for variable "Share Units".
4. Change "Use Custom dataFunction" to "Yes" and even though the 3rd column reappears, the second brand still has missing values for variables "Share Units" and "Share Volume".
Finally changing the DataSource verifies that the problem is not just with XML parsed files. A simple ArrayCollection defined with Objects containing fields with numeric types behaves in the exact same way.
