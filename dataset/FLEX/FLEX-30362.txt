Summary:
The spark scroller is recorded as a series of steps during a scroll event by QTP.
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Insert a spark Datagrid with multiple entries so that the scrollbar appears.
2. Start recording using QTP.
3. Record the scrolling interaction.
Actual Results:
More than one interaction is recorded. The scroll action is recorded as a series of events and not as a single event.
This didn't use to happen in mx controls.
Expected Results:
Only one interaction should be recorded for the endpoint.
Workaround (if any):
The user can delete the redundant steps from the recorded script.
