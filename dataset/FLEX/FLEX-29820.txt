Summary:
IAutomationObjectHelper.addSynchronization doesn't work
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a component that takes several seconds to complete replay asynchronously, and calls IAutomationObjectHelper.addSynchronization during replay to handle that
2. Create a script that involves that component, but also that involves another component that only becomes created after the first action is finished replaying
3. Replay the script
Actual Results:
An error is thrown because automation tries to play because it's moved onto the next action, instead of respecting IAutomationObjectHelper.addSynchronization
Expected Results:
It waits for the action to complete
The problem is in QTPAdapter.findObjectID. QTP tries to play the next script one line (the one after the one that is still running) and Flex automation tries to find the target, but because the target doesnt' exist yet, gets a bunch of invalid possible target matches. Flex automation should be checking automationManager.isSynchronized prior to trying to find the target, and if things are still running it should be returning to QTP AutomationError.OBJECT_NOT_VISIBLE.
