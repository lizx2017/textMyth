Summary:
UIStatusBarStyleLightContent not working on iPhone 6
Description:
I've noticed that the UI status bar content colour, despite being set to white/light, doesn't appear to work on my iPhone 6. Nothing has changed on the iPad running iOS 8 so I suspect that this is an issue with the resolution change. Indeed, reports online suggest that this might be because the application isn't being scaled properly.
