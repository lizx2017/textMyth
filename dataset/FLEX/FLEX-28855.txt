Summary:
ActionBar button more difficult to click when using the BeveledBackButtonSkin (iOS) than the basic Skin
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Add a CSS media query to make Action Bar buttons looks like iOS:
@media (os-platform: "IOS") {
s|ActionBar
{ titleAlign: center; paddingLeft:8; }
s|ActionBar s|Group#navigationGroup s|Button
{ skinClass: ClassReference("com.bg.comp.common.button.skin.BeveledBackButtonSkinOverride"); }
}
2. Try clicking the button in the Action Bar
3.
Actual Results:
Button is easily clicked
Expected Results:
Sometimes, the button does not react
Workaround (if any):
-
Reproduced with 4.5.1 and 4.6 i4. All of our iOS user are having a bad time trying to press that button, it fails 50% of the time. I believe it is because of the skin, only the skin can be clicked so it is smaller than the actionBar height and can be hard to get proper touch events.
The skin should have some kind of hit area that would cover the whole surface, not just the skin.
