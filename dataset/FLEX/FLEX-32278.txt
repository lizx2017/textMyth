Summary:
Overlaid doesn't show data tips for hidden series.
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. see example here http://blog.flexexamples.com/2007/10/11/creating-clustered-stacked-overlaid-and-100-bar-charts-in-flex-3/
2. select "overlaid"
3. check "showDataTips"
4. mouse over each series
Actual Results:
Data tips are shown for the series that are visible, but not for the series that is hidden. (However, the data tip is shown if you check "showAllDataTips")
Also tried giving each series an alpha, which allows the series to be visible, but still doesn't enable data tips.
Expected Results:
All data tips should be shown when moused over, even for the series that is invisible.
We're running Flex Builder 3.0.194161.
