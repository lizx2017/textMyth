Summary:
NullPointerException in FlexJS compiler
Description:
org.apache.flex.compiler.internal.codegen.externals.pass.NamespaceResolutionPass.visit (Line 90) throws a NullPointerException if comment is null.
It seems to occur if the current statement is an assignment, but the parameter does not have some special jsdoc info ...
                    comment = first.getJSDocInfo();
Unfortunately it is only possible to find out which file the problem is in (ASSIGN 23 [source_file: [google_maps_api_v3_11]] [length: 16]) but that doesn't help much.
