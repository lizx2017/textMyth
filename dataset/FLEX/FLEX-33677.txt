Flex SDK 4.6
[Problem]
=========
The mouse click event is triggered by dragging upper left and is not triggered by dragging lower right.
STEPS TO REPRODUCE:
===================
1. Run the sample.
2. click and hold the mouse down and drag to the lower right, select a rectangle and then release mouse.
3. click and hold the mouse down and drag to the upper left, select a rectangle and then release mouse.
RESULT:
=======
For step 2, you can find the mouse click event is not triggered.
For step 3, you can find the mouse click event is triggered.
EXPECTED:
=========
As the customer has separate logic for mouse clicking, they want the above operation(select a rectangle) does not trigger mouse click event. So they want step 3. also does not trigger mouse click event.
[System environment]
