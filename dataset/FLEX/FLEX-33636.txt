Summary:
Error when creating new project in FB 4.7 using SDK 4.10.0 (11.8/3.8)
Description:
After letting the Installer download the 4.10.0 SDK (FP 11.8/AIR 3.8) into the FB sdks folder, when I create a new project using the New Project wizard, I immediately get an error:
Initializer for 'layout': values of type spark.layouts.supportClasses.LayoutBase cannot be represented in text.
Removing the 'layout="absolute"' attribute from the s:Application tag removes the error, but I don't think there should be an error in the default FB project...
