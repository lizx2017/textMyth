Summary:
ADVANCEDDATAGRID - Default Header Renderer Not Rendering Label Correctly
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Compile the attached application.
2. Run the application in Debug mode.
3. Open a node.
4. Breakpoint should occur at line 354 of quickdrillADG.mxml (if not toggle a breakpoint at that line - the last line of buildNavColumnHeader() method.
5. In the variables window in Flex Builder, drill to "this" > "_columns" > "0" > "headerText".
6. Debug shows the value as "Industry / Sector", but the actual Label is still just "Industry".
7. Resume debug, to allow the actions to complete. The header label still reads "Industy".
8. If you really want to have some fun, resize the window (stretch any corner of the window or Maximize or Restore the window size). The correct headerText value magically appears!!!
Actual Results:
See "Steps to reproduce" above.
Expected Results:
The label of the first column should be displayed as it has been set when the method is called.
Workaround (if any):
Go back to Flex Builder 3 Beta 1.
