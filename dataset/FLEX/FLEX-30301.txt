If QTP object repository gives wrong message when trying to Highlight a Flex object that has not been created yet
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1.Run the attached application
2.Start the QTP Object Repository Manager (ORM)
3.Click both the app's buttons. This will unhide one button and create another
4.In ORM, click the Add Objects button, click on textArea1, whose ID is ta1
5. In the Add to Repository dialog, click "Spark Application" so it will add all children
6. In the Define Object Fileter dialog, select "All Object Types" and click OK
7. In the ORM, if you now select textArea3 and then click the "Highlight in Application" button; that text area will be highlighted momentarily.
8. Now refresh the application so textArea3 is no longer existing
9. Again, in ORM, select textArea3 and then click the "Highlight in Application"
Actual Results:
An error is triggered, which is expected, but the message does not make sense:
"The test object description is not unique. More than one object in the application matches the description."
