Summary:
Certain DateField format strings causes null value in selectedDate
Description:
This is identical to FLEX-16656 but it appears the bug still occurs when certain format strings are used. I have discovered that the two letter month "MM" works fine but the three letter month "MMM" does not. The following definition caused the selectedDate property to be set to null after a date is chosen:
<mx:DateField id="badDateField" formatString="DD/MMM/YYYY"/>
EG: 14/Oct/2013
The following appears to work fine and doesn't cause the date to be set to null after a date is chosen:
<mx:DateField id="goodDateField" formatString="DD/MM/YYYY"/>
EG: 14/10/2013
