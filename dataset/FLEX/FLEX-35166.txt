Summary:
Installer can't handle Adobe AIR 24
Description:
Adobe is now distributing the AIR SDK as EXE and DMG files instead of ZIP and TBZ2. The Installer does not know how to handle that.
Apparently, these changes were made because platform security measures were going to start to deny executables inside of compressed archives, so switching to signed executables is required.
