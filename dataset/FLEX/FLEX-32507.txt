Summary:
scrollVertically UP leaves a slice space in the last visible row
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Set the alternatingItemColors of the ADG to [0xFF0000, 0x00FF00].
2. Run the application.
3. Resize the page size to make the Vertical Scroll Bar visible and, make the last visible row' height nearly to the paddingTop.
4. Scroll Vertically UP.
Actual Results:
There is a slice space of white color in the last visible row.
Expected Results:
It shoud be red or green, since the alternatingItemColors is set to [0xFF0000, 0x00FF00].
Workaround (if any):
AdvancedListBase.as→scrollVertically()→Line 6420
if (item.y >= listContent.height)
{ deleteRow = true; }
⇒is supposed to be
if (rowData.y >= listContent.height)
{ deleteRow = true; }
Override is necessary.
