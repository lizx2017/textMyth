Summary:
Charts running slowing on IOS and Android
Description:
PS: you don't have MX:Charts listed in the "Components dropdown"
This bug is difficult to write up and give you many clues. But this problem does exist in my app.
I have some charts I'm displaying in a view, actually 1 chart per view.
The charts do work nicely (speed of display) in desktop mode on 4.5.1 and 4.52.
Mobile is where the problem shows up:
4.5.1 (IOS/Android): the page takes about 2 seconds to display (acceptable speed)
4.5.2 (IOS/Android): the page takes about 5 seconds to display (unacceptable speed)
I have not changed a lick of code from 4.5.1.
I did build a simple demo app with just a sample chart for both my test machines
(iPad 1 and Toshiba Thrive). The test speed ran fine so there is no reason to give you that code.
I did put this sample chart code into my real app and the display speed is still bad (5 seconds).
I can't tell if the slowness is coming from the previous view page being destroyed slowly or the MX charts just
taking a long time to build.
I was hoping for that 50% speed bust 4.5.2 was suppose to deliver, but I got the opposite.
You do have a problem here, if I can help let me know.
My System:
Flex Builder (4.5.1.and 4.5.2)
