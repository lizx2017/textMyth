Summary:
Don't assume installer.xml exists
Description:
A minimal install consists of downloading a binary, checking it's MD5, and unzipping into it selected directory - all f this can be done without an ant instal script needed to be run.. Currently the installer assumes that a installer.xml exist and give an RTE if it doesn't.
