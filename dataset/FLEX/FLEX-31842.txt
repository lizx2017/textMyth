Summary:
CLONE -Scrolling happens even when ADG is disabled
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. set enabled property to false on DG with horizontal and vertical scroll bars at run time during action script (or alternatively run bug file)
2. in bug file click on button disable DG
3. scroll on horizontal or vertical scroll bars on top DG
Actual Results:
scrolling happens
Expected Results:
scrolling should not happen as DG is disabled
Workaround (if any):
set enabled=false in mxml. (as can be seen in second DG in bottom) however this is not much convenient if one wants to disable DG based on some user input
