Summary:
Memory Leak in GridViewLayout
Description:
The Spark GridViewLayout uses strong dictionaries for caching itemrenderers, often leading to a situation where those itemrenderers are never released to the garbage collector.
The proposed patched changes GridViewLayout to use weak reference dictionaries and additionally adds a public method to Grid to allow the client to explicitly flush the item renderer cache.
