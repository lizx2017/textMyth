Summary:
Spark Label doesnt display Bold font : Korean Font
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Please run the attached file.
2. Also, place the font file in the same project .
3. See the difference in how the spark label displays the text in fontWeight="bold" setting.
Actual Results:
When you set the weight as bold, the label actually displays the font as normal. And with no such setting it displays the font as bold.
Not sure why this behavior when MX:Label seem to work fine.
Expected Results:
Font weight bold setting should be honored by Label text display when the font file is embedded.
Workaround (if any):
N/A
Have attached the font file and application file for reference.
