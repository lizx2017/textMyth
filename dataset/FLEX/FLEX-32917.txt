Summary:
Unable to look up source of component under mx.charts package with SDK 3.5
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create new Flex project with SDK 3.5 setting
2. In Main.mxml, Hit Ctrl+Shift+T to open "Open a Type" dialog
3. Enter PieChart and select it
Actual Results: The error message that source of mx.charts.PieChart could not be found in <Burrito Installed Directory>\sdks\3.5.0\frameworks\libs\datavisualization.swc.
Expected Results: It should be looked up source of mx.charts.PieChart.
The fix of https://bugs.adobe.com/jira/browse/FB-26181 and https://bugs.adobe.com/jira/browse/FLEXDMV-2310 should be incorporated to the Burrito build.
Workaround (if any): Modify source path of datavisualization.swc to correct one in library path.
<Burrito Installed Directory>\sdks\3.5.0\frameworks\projects\datavisualisation\src is a correct one.
