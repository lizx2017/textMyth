Summary:
DateTimeAxis displays last day of month rather than first when labelFunction is specified
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a line chart with a DateTimeAxis
2. Set alignLabelsToUnits to true and autoAdjust to false on the DateTimeAxis
3. Have category names in the dataProvider be something like: "3/4/2007", "4/8/2007", "5/13/2007", etc.
4. Use a labelFunction with the DateTimeAxis that shows months and days
(I have also attached a sample application)
Actual Results: Dates on the DateTimeAxis are labeled one day prior to what they should be. eg. the label that should say "April 1, 2007" says "March 31, 2007"
Expected Results: Each tick on the DateTimeAxis should represent the beginning of a month
Workaround (if any): The problem is in the roundDateUp function of DateTimeAxis. I changed it to create a new date rather than modify the one passed in and that fixed the problem... but who wants to have to modify the built in components to fix a bug? Try outputting the result of the roundDateUp function! It is not always successful.
