Summary:
[FalconJX] Context Lost on Event Listeners
Description:
When there are callbacks in which event listeners are added, the compiler calls the Language.closure method with incorrect arguments, namely the second argument should be 'self' rather than 'this'.
For example, in this test app:
https://paste.apache.org/3GsA
The result is:
https://paste.apache.org/C0P2
Consequently if you run the test app in release (strict) mode you'll get a run time error.
