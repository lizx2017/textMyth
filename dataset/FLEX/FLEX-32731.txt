Summary:
[Mirroring]Axis labels are clipped in sdk 4.1, since label is used instead of UITextField
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a AIR project using sdk 4.1.0.14484
2. Copy the mxml file
3. Compile and run the app.
Actual Results: The horizontal axis labels are clipped, even if there is enough space for the entire label to be displayed. Also, clicking on the button, "Add item at index 0" will show the labels fully.
Note: This might be due to the usage of label as axis labels instead of UITextField. Hence, its working as expected in 4.0 sdk.
Expected Results: The axis label should be shown fully.
