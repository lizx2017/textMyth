Summary:
Sorting destroys grouping of GroupingCollection
Description:
Steps to reproduce (use the attached MXML file):
1. Click button "Load Data with Sorting". ADG gets populated with data and column 1 will show sorting.
2. Open NA > New York
Actual Results:
Third level is NOT sorted.
Expected Results:
Third level should be sorted.
Workaround (if any):
Do not specify sorting on the dataProvider, but instead provide compareFunction for Grouping. However this introduces another issue:
1. Click button "Load Data with custom Grouping compare function". ADG gets populated with data and column 1 is NOT sorted.
2. Open NA > New York. Third level is sorted.
3. Click on the header of column 1 to sort it.
4. Close New York.
5. Open it again
Actual Results:
Third level is NOT sorted.
Expected Results:
Third level should remain sorted.
