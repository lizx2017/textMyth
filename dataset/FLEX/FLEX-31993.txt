Summary:
When ADG.variableRowHeight is set to true and ADGColumn.headerWordWrap is set to false the header text is not truncated with elipses.
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a ADG with few columns with one column with a long headerText.
2. Set ADG.variableRowHeight to true and set headerWordWrap to false on the column.
3. Run the app
4. Resize the column with long header text so that there is not enough space to display the complete header text.
Actual Results:
The header text doesn't get truncated with elipses. As soon as variableRowHeight is set to true the truncation with elipses doesn't seem to happen.
Expected Results:
The header text should have shown elipses.
