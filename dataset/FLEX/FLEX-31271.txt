Summary:
This LineChart has problems when baseAtZero = true and all the data points have the same value.
Description:
Reproduction:
1. Run the attached sample code
Note: I was not able to reproduce this by starting with a simple LineChart with all the y values the same.
Actual Results:
the first graph will display one data point partly hidden by the axis
the second graph displays as expected (the y values are not all the same)
the third chart (all the y values are the same) doesn't display any data points unless baseAtZero is set to false
Expected Results:
The chart should show the data points for the third chart no matter what the setting for baseAtZero
Partial Workaround: set baseAtZero="false"
