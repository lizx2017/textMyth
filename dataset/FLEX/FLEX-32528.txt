Summary:
AdvancedDataGrid renderer issue
Description:
I have a AdvancedDataGrid which is populated with flat data and it has got multiple renderers like renderers for columns and custom renderers for Summary for a few coulmns with dynamic groupings.What i observed is whenever i use itemRenderer along with custom Summary renderer,the AdvancedDatagrid starts behaving weird.First thing that is observed is the ColumnSpan property stops working when the column renderered with itemRenderer is encountered.I have used ExpandAll() on my AdvancedDatagrid.Whenver i collapse an item and reopen it the renderered Column value is replicated in the next row below the original row .Is this a bug in flex.Since when i dont use a renderer i didnt see any of this behaviour
Steps to reproduce:
1.create an AdvncedDatagrid with flat data with dynamic grouping and customized summary renderer
2.create itemrenderer for a few coulmns to render data
3.use columnSpan as 0 for the summary renderer for column 1
Actual Results:
ColumnSpan stops rendering when column rendered using itemRenderer is encountered.
when an item is closed and opened ,the rendered column data is replicated in the next row
Expected Results:
ColumnSpan property should span the entired grid
Data shouldnt be replicated
