Summary:
QTP doesn't record Flex app with 1.5 style wrapper (ie. the javascript <object> id param contains a period)
Description:
Customer issue
Reproduction:
1.Create a basic html wrapper for a flex2 .swf (example @ bugFile url below)
2. In the javascript file - give the <object> tag's id param a value that contains a period.
document.write("id=’app.swf’ ");
3. open the html wrapper in a browser, try to record from QTP and you will not see any events being recorded for the Flex app.
4. updated the line above to:
document.write("id=’appWithOutPeriod");
5. reload browser with the updated wrapper and QTP will display the SWF events correctly.
Workaround: make sure custom wrapper doesn't have a javascript object id with period characters.
