Summary:
addSortField method in the AdvancedDataGridEx degenarates the internal state of the Sort object
Description:
In the last line of the addSortField method one can find the following statement:
collection.sort.fields.push(field);
which as the result adds the field to a Sort._fields array, but makes no chance to update the Sort.fieldList array.
Possible workaround - overwrite the addSortField method and replace the problematic line with the following lines:
var fields : Array = [];
fields.push(field);
collection.sort.fields = fields;
