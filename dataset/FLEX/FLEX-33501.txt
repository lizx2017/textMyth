Summary:
Source attachment of TextLayout.swc points to the wrong directory
Description:
The TextLayout.swc inside the SDK folder points to the wrong source attachment. This causes the debugger to not find the source of this swc, so you can't debug the TLF anymore.
To fix this, the source attachment should point to this folder:
/<SDK DIRECTORY>/4.9.1/frameworks/projects/textLayout/3.0.33/src instead of
/<SDK DIRECTORY>/4.9.1/frameworks/projects/textLayout/src
which it does by default.
