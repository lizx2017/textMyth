Summary:
Known Issues (so that Bugbash need not reproduce these issues)
Description:
1. In cell selection mode, the keyboard shortcuts override the tree keyboard
shortcuts. Waiting for feedback from Andrew Kirkpatrick, Ethan Eismann and Rob
Adams on how to resolve this.
2. In cell selection mode, after an editor is opened and closed, the up/down
arrow keys don't work. A right arrow fixes the issue and then keyboard shortcuts
work again.
3. In cell selection mode, F2 is not implemented (opens the item editor).
4. After sorting, mouseover the vertical line causes the sorted header to be
highlighted.
5. When custom rows is present, mouseover the edge of the custom row in the
second column (or any column other than the first column) causes highlighting of
that individual column as opposed to highlighting of the combined column
spanning cell.
6. In cell selection mode, when the selected cell / caret is in the first or
last columns, left/right arrow does not start horizontal scrolling.
7. When tree disclosure tweening is in progress, the selectedCell does not move
accordingly, it moves only after the tweening display is over
