Summary:
Recording and Replaying on Advacned Grid is extremely slow
Description:
This is in house application using Flex, other part of the flex UI can be recorded and replayed slowly but bearable.
When it comes to Advanced Grid, the slowness becomes unbearable.
Using QTP SPY and Flex SPY, we found out that advanced grid has automationName, but none of the component inside the advanced grid has any automationName property,
we assigned the automationName manually , it didn't make much difference.
The application is huge so there is no way I can offer any sample. If it is allowed, I can bring my machine over to adobe San Jose office so you can check it out.
This is a high priority issue for us, so any quick help is greatly appreciated.
