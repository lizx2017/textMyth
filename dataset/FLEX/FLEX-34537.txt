Summary:
Minimize duplication between HorizontalLayout and VerticalLayout classes
Description:
HorizontalLayout and VerticalLayout share most of their code and logic. The only differences are in comments and variable / function names. This introduces the risk that bugs found in one of them might not be transferred to the other one as well. Same for added features.
Their common code (around 90%) could be placed inside a common ancestor or inside a class member. I personally vote for common ancestor.
