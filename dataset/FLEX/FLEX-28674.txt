Summary:
Slider dataTip updates before it moves
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run the following app:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<s:Application xmlns:fx="http://ns.adobe.com/mxml/2009"
xmlns:s="library://ns.adobe.com/flex/spark"
xmlns:mx="library://ns.adobe.com/flex/mx" minWidth="955" minHeight="600">
<fx:Declarations>
<!-- Place non-visual elements (e.g., services, value objects) here -->
</fx:Declarations>
<fx:Script>
<![CDATA[
public function formatDataTip(value:Number):Object
{ var price:int = int(value); var rString:String = ""; for (var i:int = 0; i < price; i++) rString += "$"; return rString; }
]]
>
</fx:Script>
<s:HSlider x="100" y="100" minimum="4" maximum="10" width="500" dataTipFormatFunction="formatDataTip"/>
</s:Application>
2. Start dragging the thumb around.
Actual Results:
Notice that the number of "$" characters seems to increase before the data tip actually moves to the next location. This is actually more noticeable on a mobile device.
Expected Results:
The dataTip's label doesn't update until after it has been moved to the correct location.
Workaround (if any):
none.
