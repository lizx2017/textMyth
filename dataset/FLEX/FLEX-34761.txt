Summary:
DataGrid DragScoll does not work if you disable dropping and call hideDropIndicator on some rows.
Description:
The DataGrid's dragscroll behavior is kicked off from within the showDropIndicator() method. It's common to handle/override the dragOverHandler to only allow dropping on certain rows. If you have the rows at the bottom of the scroll window configured to not allow dropping, you would also want to call hideDropIndicator() for those rows. But by doing so, you've also disabled the dragScrolling behavoir.
The dragScrolling behavior should be functional by the drop target calls DragManager.acceptDragDrop() from the dragEnterHandler(). It should not be tied directly to the showDropIndicator() method.
