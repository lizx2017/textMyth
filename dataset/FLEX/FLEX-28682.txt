An RTE might occur:

at spark.components::AccordionContent/enterFrameHandler()[/Users/mvujovic/Documents/FlexSources/trunk/frameworks/projects/spark/src/spark/components/AccordionContent.as:648]
Expected Results:
No RTE.
Workaround (if any):
None.
Notes:
This is not a regression. I saw it before Bear's selection refactor. I think the destruction policy is being applied twice on AccordionContent (timing issues).
