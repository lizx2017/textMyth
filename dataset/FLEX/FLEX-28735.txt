Summary:
Spark list selecteditem after sort bug
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1.Give an ArrayCollection as DataProvider for a spark:List component
2.Add an item to this ArrayCollection, programmatically select it in the list and apply a sort function to the collection to preserve an expected order with a Sort / refresh() logic.
My simple goal : I want to preserve my ordered ArrayCollection even if i insert a new item.
Actual Results:
Only the first added item is well selected, not the others.
Expected Results:
Just like with SDK 4.1 (work well) or with mx:List, the last inserted item has to be selected after the sort logic.
Workaround (if any):
Not found after two days, i can't go back to sdk 4.1 because of other framework's bugs and i has to use spark:List because of is skinning capabilities.
