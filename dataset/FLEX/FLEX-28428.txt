Summary:
Button removed with removeChild() reappears in over state when readded
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Add a SimpleButton to the stage
2. In the click listener for the button, remove the button using removeChild()
3. Re-add the button using addChild()
Actual Results:
The button is re-added in the over state, not the up state
Expected Results:
The button is re-added or the up state, or reset to the up state
Workaround (if any):
None.
I've added a project file to test, with two classes (swf included): MyButton.as (just there to create a button) and Main.as (shows the bug). There are 2 buttons on the stage; one set to removeChild() when you click on it, and one set to visible = false when you click on it. Press space to bring both buttons back. The button set to removeChild() will come back in it's over state, while the visible = false button will come back properly, in it's up state.
If you remove the button with visible = false, then the bug isn't present, it's only with removeChild(). I thought it might be because the mouse out listener wasn't getting called, but in looking at the listeners, it's getting called fine (it might be that in mouse_out, where you'd normally reset to the up state, there's a check or something to see if the stage exists).
Possibly related: when clicking on the button and removing it with removeChild(), the focus isn't reset (i.e. you have to click on the stage if you want any keyboard events to fire), whereas with visible = false, it is. Setting stage.focus = null, or stage.focus = stage; doesn't resolve the problem though.
