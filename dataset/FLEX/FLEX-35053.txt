Summary:
Compiler does not respect the implements="..." attribute in MXML
Description:
It seems that there is a bug where the compiler does not respect the implements="..." attribute in MXML.
MXML Example:
<!-- MyInitialView.mxml -->
<js:ViewBase xmlns:fx="http://ns.adobe.com/mxml/2009"
xmlns:js="library://ns.apache.org/flexjs/basic"
implements="com.demo.core.interfaces.IViewMyInitialView">
</js:ViewBase>
That information is not being included in the MyInitialView.js output:
MyInitialView.prototype.FLEXJS_CLASS_INFO = { names: [
{ name: 'MyInitialView', qName: 'MyInitialView' }
] };
