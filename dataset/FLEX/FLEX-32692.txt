Summary:
AdvancedDataGrid border not rendered when switching between Flex 4 states
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Using Flash Builder Build 268199 standalone
1. Run attached Test.mxml
2. Click State1 button - ADG and DataGrid controls both display
3. Click default button - both controls disappear
4. Click State1 button - Both ADG and DataGrid controls display, but the ADG is rendered without a border
5. Attempted with both Wireframe and Sky themes - same result for both.
Actual Results:
The ADG renders without a border the second and subsequent time it is displayed.
Expected Results:
The ADG should render with a border every time
Workaround (if any):
Hide and show the parent component to force a redraw of the ADG control which redisplays the border
