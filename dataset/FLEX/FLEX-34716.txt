Summary:
Framework Locales fail on Linux
Description:
Framework Locales are not working when compiling on Linux. Using the same test project on Windows works. When compiled on Linux, DateFormatter returns error code usingdefault and defaults back to English days and months. But on Windows it accepts the requested locale and gives days and months in that locale.
This has been blocking me from releasing the next version of my app, which we promised localization for. Although I was able to test my simple proof on both Linux and Windows I cannot use Windows for my actual app. So I am truly blocked.
