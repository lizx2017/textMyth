Summary:
[StageText][iOS] Unable to set focus to StageText using setFocus
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Compile and run the attached project, or run the attached .ipa file on an iOS device.
2. Watch the label at the top (it begins by displaying "Start:" and is set to display every focus and softKeyboard event that is fired by the StageText component) as the timers assign focus, then unassign focus to the StageText.
Actual Results:
No events are fired, and the label at the top does not display any change (i.e. no events are fired).
Expected Results:
There should be the following events in the following order based on the Android behavior of this application:
1. SoftKeyboard Activating (displays as "Aing" in the test application).
2. Focus In (displays as "In").
3. SoftKeyboard Activate (displays as "Act").
4. Focus Out (displays as "out").
5. SoftKeyboard Deactivate (displays as "De").
