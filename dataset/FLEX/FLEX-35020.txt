Summary:
FlexJS download page has broken link to RELEASE_NOTES 0.5.0
Description:
Context:
FlexJS download page http://flex.apache.org/download-flexjs.html provides the link to the 0.5.0 version. The link to the RELEASE_NOTES is broken
Expected result:
I can consult the 0.5.0 release note file.
Actual result:
I get a 404 error when trying to read the release note file.
Test-case:
1. Open
2. Click on the link labelled "RELEASE_NOTES"
3. Click on the first suggested mirror (in my case it was http://www.pirbot.com/mirrors/apache/flex/flexjs/0.5.0/RELEASE_NOTES ) -> page not found
It appear that all mirrors have the same issue, e.g.:
http://mirror.easyname.ch/apache/flex/flexjs/0.5.0/RELEASE_NOTES
