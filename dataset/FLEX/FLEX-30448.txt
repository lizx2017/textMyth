Summary:
Flashbuilder premium license not picked up by Automation agent (when running FlexMonkey)
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a Flex project using sdk 4.5.x and licensed Flash builder 4 premium
2. Configure project for use with Flex Monkey
3. Create test that runs 30+ recorded actions
4. Run test
Actual Results:
2 Alert popups are shown "License not present. With the trial version only limited replays/records are allowed"
Expected Results:
No alert popup, allow Flex Monkey tests to run without interruption
Workaround (if any):
Compile project using Flex sdk 4.1
Notes:
According to the Flex Monkey faqs this popup and bug is a problem with the Flex sdk and not Flex Monkey, hence why I am logging this as a bug here.
Apparently this was fixed in FLEXENT-1370 , but I am still seeing this popup
