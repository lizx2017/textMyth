Summary:
Series data graphics does not start from the beginning of the chart when DateTimeAxis is used and labelUnits are bigger than a day
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Use DateTimeAxis for horizontal axis and use AreaChart or other
2. axis labelUnits are manually or automatically set to weeks
3. do NOT use axisParsingFunction to produce Date objects for the axis but instead have Date objects directly in your series dataProvider for property that
is specified as xField property (this way the axis will use it to produce labels, ticks etc.)
4. and most important is that the Date objects from the dataProvider should not be rounded to time 0:00:00 but instead have some real time set , for example
10:25:00 AM
Actual Results:
The series data graphics does not start from the beginning of the chart.
Expected Results:
The series data graphics should start from the beginning of the chart no matter what the dataProvider is and what labelUnits are specified
Solution and explanation of the bug :
The series data graphics does not start from the beginning because sometimes the first axis tick and label position is calculated incorrectly and is positioned
incorrectly and that messes up the chart layout. The first axis tick and label position should be always a positive value between 0 and 1 (ratio of the chart's
width) but sometimes it is calculated to a negative value. This happens when the computedMinimum has greated value than the labelBase property. This in other hand occurs because roundDateUp function rounds the Date to a time = 0:00:00 and is possible to to actually decrease the value of labelBase property. The solution I found for this deffect is to make the following check right after roundDateUp in 2 methods in DateTimeAxis class - buildMinorTickCache and buildLabelCache :
labelBase = labelBase < labelMinimum ? labelMinimum : labelBase;
