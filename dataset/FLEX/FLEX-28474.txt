Summary:
Visual artefact when sliding View out with SoftKeys Keyboard open
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Add a TextInput component inside a View and set focus to it using setFocus().
2. Keybord pops up.
3. Make View slide out. In my case the TextInput filtered the dataProvider for a list in real time and clicking a list item would slide in a new view.
4. When the sliding out begins, the keybord disappears and it is replaced by a black opaque rectangle. The black rectangle is exactly the size of the keyboard.
Expected Results:
No black rectangle.
Workaround (if any):
No way to close the keyboard. The InteractiveObject has a method to bring it up, but none to send it back.
Found workaround for that by setting focus to the stage which sends the keyboard back.
Tried sending it back in the event handler for the removing event of the View, same problem: black rectangle.
