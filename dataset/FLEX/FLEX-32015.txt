Summary:
Custom data tip renderer is not used when "showAllDataTips=true"
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Set a custom data tip renderer (I have tested w/ Line Chart and Bubble Chart)
2. Set <code>showAllDataTips="true"</code>
Actual Results:
Data tips do not correctly use the the custom data tip. And their background is removed
Expected Results:
"show all" data tips should look identical to data tips that show up on rollOver
Workaround (if any):
Don't use "showAllDataTips" when you use a custom data tip renderer
