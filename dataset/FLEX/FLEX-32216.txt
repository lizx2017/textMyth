Summary:
When more numbers of new columns are assinged to the 'columns' property of Advanced DataGrid which is having less numbers of old columns, it throws runtime exception.
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1.Create an Advanced DataGrid and assign some columns to its 'columns' property .
2. On that same Advanced DataGrid assign more numbers of columns to its 'columns' property than previous one.
3. Next reassign the same number of columns being assingned in step1.It throws runtime exception and more details about exception, I have attached snap shot of the same.
Note: I have found one more strange behaviour of this issue.If I assign same numbers of column for both the aforesaid steps 1 and 2 and execute step 3, I don't find any runtime error.Also if I assign less numbers of column in step2 than step 1 and execute step 3, I don't find any runtime error.
Actual Results:
A runtime error
Expected Results:
Runtime error should not occur.
