Summary:
The Spark mobile TextAreaSkin does not initially position text with embedded fonts correctly in iOS
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
Compile the attached EmbeddingFontsView.mxml file into an iOS app and navigate to this view on the iPad. You will also need at least one font for embedding, but it does not matter which font you choose.
Actual Results:
The native, non-embedded text renders fine. The text using embedded fonts is positioned below the visible bounds of each TextArea except if there is a filter applied to the TextArea, in which case it is positioned correctly. Tapping on the embedded text that has no filter causes the text to position correctly. Please see the attached screenshots.
Screenshot #1: Initial view with embedded text positioned incorrectly
Screenshot #2: View after having tapped the second (ta2) TextArea
Expected Results:
The embedded text positions correctly (as in ta1, ta3, and ta5) without having to apply a filter or tap the TextArea.
Workaround (if any):
Applying a filter to the TextArea seems to correct this problem as indicated.
