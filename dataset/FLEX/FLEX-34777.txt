Summary:
SpinnerList SelectionIndicator visible when SpinnerList height set to 0
Description:
Using the new Android4 or iOS7 skins, when a SpinnerList's height is set to 0, the SpinnerList itself is not visible but the SpinnerList's selectionIndicator is still visible.
A SpinnerList set to 0 height contains another bug:
when this Spinnerlist of 0 height is placed directly below a button (e.g., in a Vgroup container with 0 gap) mouse/touch clicks on the button area below the button label are blocked.
When inspecting the MouseEvent.CLICK event, the localY of a mouse click event on the button's lower half reports a negative value; as event.target a SpinnerListSkin is returned.
