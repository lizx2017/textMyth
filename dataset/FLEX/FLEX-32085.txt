Summary:
AdvancedDataGrid Scrollbars appear when they shouldn't (when the hierarchy is expanded)
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a advanced datagrid with datasource.
2. Leaving the hierarchy unexpanded, apply a filter function. The data will filter appropriately and the scrollbars will behave as expected.
3. Now expand some of the nodes in the hierarchy and apply the filter function. The data will now filter, but the vertical scrollbar will appear when it isn't required!
(See attached file)
Actual Results:
The scrollbar appears!
Expected Results:
The vertical scrollbar should only appear if the visual content of the AdvancedDataGrid exceeds the boundaries of the grid.
Workaround (if any):
The scrollbars will render properly if you re-create the HierarchicalData object, but this is a bit of brute force workaround.
