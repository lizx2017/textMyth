Summary:
During replayAutomatableEvent in DateFieldAutomationImpl does not open
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Start recording steps using Automation, click to open DateField.
2. Select a date.
3. Stop recording steps.
4. Replay steps.
Actual Results:
Unable to replay
Expected Results:
To open Calendar display due to open event.
Workaround (if any):
I monkey patched it by coping "mx.automation.delegates.controls.DateFieldAutomationImpl". After line 142, I then added:
if (validOpen)
{
dateField.open();
return true;
}
I will attach entire file for your review.
