Summary:
Selection layer should be in front of content
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create an AdvancedDataGrid that uses a custom item renderer that doesn't have a transparent background. As an example, I've attached a project that uses a custom renderer to display an image.
2. Select a row
Actual Results:
The image doesn't appear selected - the selection goes behind it. Other controls (like the default text labels) appear selected only because they're transparent, and the selection layer sits behind the actual content.
Expected Results:
The selection layer should be in front of the list content layer, and have an alpha transparency to allow the items behind it to show through.
Workaround (if any):
I've been able to manually re-order the sprites (ListData::selectionLayer and listSubContent), but then the selected row isn't visible until you adjust the alpha of the selection layer. I believe this should be done as the default.
