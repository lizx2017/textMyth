Summary:
Datagrid selectedIndex property is not working sometimes
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Please write a program by taking student data as an example.
It will display two data grids. Display some data(it should have common, not common ) in both the grids.
2. Select the same student in other data grid if you select the student in one grid. Student no. like 12-23-45. i.e., if you select a student who has no. 12-23-45 then same student should be selected in first grid.
3.It will work for some time. After that, you can see two different rows selected in the grid.
I have binded int to the selectedIndex property of datagrid. But, I can still see the issue.
Please correct me if i am wrong.
