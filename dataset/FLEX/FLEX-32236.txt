Summary:
Cannot override protected method AdvancedDataGridBaseEx.getSeparator() due to inaccessible property
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Extend OLAPDataGrid, and override protected function getSeparator(i:int, seperators:Array, headerLines:UIComponent):UIComponent
2. call the super with:
var sep:UIComponent = super.getSeparator(i, separators, headerLines);
...
do stuff to the skin child of sep
...
return sep;
3. get compilation error:
Severity and Description Path Resource Location Creation Time Id
1178: Attempted access of inaccessible property separators through a reference with static type MyCrossTabClass. MVCPrototype/ MyCrossTabClass.as line 104 1218533337857 13044
It would appear that two members of AdvancedDataGridBaseEx are despatched to getSeparator(), separators and lockedSeparators.
As lockedSeparators is protected I am assuming the issue is caused by separators being private...
For the record, I am attempting to extend the DataGridHeaderSeparator class with a class which allows me to modify the skin's properties at runtime. To achieve this I need a reference to the separator skin child of the sep UIComponent.
