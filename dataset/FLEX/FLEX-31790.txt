Summary:
Unselecting a cell with Ctrl-Click causes selectedCells to report wrong information
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Select several cells in an AdvancedDataGrid using shift-click or Ctrl-click
2. Ctrl-click on a selected cell somewhere in the middle of the selection.
3. selectedCells will report that about half of the selected cells are now unselected.
4. Ctrl-clicking on other cells sometimes makes no change to selectedCells (because the cell has already been removed).
Actual Results:
The selectedCells property returns a truncated list of the currently selected cells. Assuming that the implementation is similar to the regular DataGrid, it would appear that the tail of the linked list of selected cells is not hooked back up to the previously selected cell when a link is removed in the middle.
There are no visible indications that there is a problem with selection.
Expected Results:
Only the cell unselected should be removed from the selection list. The list of selectedCells should match the cells with visual selection indicators.
Workaround (if any):
Starting over with the selection and never unselecting a cell does work.
