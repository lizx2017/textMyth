Summary:
TLF Problems with Tables
Description:
Hi all,
I found 3 different bugs with TLF Tables.
1. I can't change the width of table after I gave one.
You can found in the example as error_1() method.
2. I can't give to different columns different widths.
You can found in the example as error_2() method.
3. I can't Center the table in the TextFlow.
You can found in the example as error_3() method.
I tested with Animate CC but as in previous reports Harbs create a .as file, I did it.
If you have any question or something isn't clear, please ask me.
Thank you.
