Summary:
ADG not scrolling correctly when using an item renderer
Description:
The doc example, GroupADGChartRenderer.mxml, on this page, http://livedocs.adobe.com/flex/3/html/advdatagrid_10.html uses an item renderer to display a chart in the ADG. If you expand multiple rows, the ADG displays verical scroll bars so that you can scroll up and down.
However, if you expand just the first row, the scroll bars appear, but the ADG does not scroll.
