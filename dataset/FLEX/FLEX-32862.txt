Summary:
bitmapData.copyPixels Y axis issues
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. In flex 3 create a new bitmap (1900w x 1000h) with something drawn on it
2. Try to copyPixels from itself to different X axis in rect
3. Try to copyPixels from itself to different Y axis in rect
Actual Results:
X Axis works fine
Y Axis with low numbers (0-400) copies content in a choppy, highly unexpected way
Expected Results:
X Axis works fine
Y Axis works fine
Workaround (if any):
When trying to change the Y source rect, you can't call on same bitmapData without calling it's .Clone() function
