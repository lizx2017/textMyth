Summary:
Spark DataGrid memory leak
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. click the add button in the main application to create a new instance of Comp3 and add it to the main application
2. click remove button to remove the Comp3 instance from the main application
Actual Results:
Comp3 is not garbage collected after removeElement if the DataGrid's dataProvider is set (neither localy or via model), no matter if the user interacted with the DataGrid or not.
There is always one instance of DataGrid (and therefor Comp3) in memory. (also if you force garbage collection)
Note: Comp3 will be removed from memory if the user creates a new instance and adds it to the main application (click add button again)
Expected Results:
DataGrid and Comp3 get immediately garbage collected as Comp3 is removed from the parent.
