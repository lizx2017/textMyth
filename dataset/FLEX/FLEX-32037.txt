Summary:
DMV is not building resource bundle SWC's as framework SDK does
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Install Flex builder 193974
2. Give valid professional license in help->manage flex licenses(DMV source will be extracted)
3. go to <flex builder install dir>\sdks\3.0.0\fbpro
4. compile datavisualization source by giving ant -f dmv_automation_build.xml
5. Note that resource bundle swcs are not generated under <flex builder install dir>\sdks\3.0.0\frameworks\locale\en_US
compiling framework sdk source also rebuilds the resource bundle swc's
Actual Results:
resource bundle swcs are not generated under <flex builder install dir>\sdks\3.0.0\frameworks\locale\en_US
Expected Results:
resource bundle swcs should get generated under <flex builder install dir>\sdks\3.0.0\frameworks\locale\en_US
