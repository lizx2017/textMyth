Summary:
Sort column number displays as single digit instead of double digit. Example: sort number 11 is displayed as '1'.
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. If you have more than 10 columns in your ADG
2. Click on each sort column number so the sort number is shown as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc.
3. Horizontal Scroll enough so that you see enough columns after 9th column. Click on to sort 9th column, 10th column, 11th column, 12th column etc.
Actual Results: 10th sort numbered column is displayed as '1' sort number, 11th sort numbered column is displayed as '1' sort number etc. Double digit sort numbers are not accomodated in the available sort column number space
Expected Results: double digit sort column numbers should be accomodated in the space.
Workaround (if any): Use the horizontal scrolling to get the double digit sort number adjusted in the space.
