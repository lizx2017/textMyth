Summary:
Spark components objects are identified as FlexObject in Flex 4
Description:
We are trying to automate a Flex 4 application using QTP 10. During this process we are facing the below issues regarding object identification.
1. Spark component Issue: Our application is having MX components and Spark components. Although we have Flex 4 add-in installed for QTP 10 we are only able to identify the MX component objects properly. All the Spark component objects are getting identified as higher level - "FlexObject" (Irrespective of the type like Label, combobox e.t.c.) and not to the granular level (Not as FlexLabel or respective object type). Due to this we are not able to fetch the values of those Spark component objects.
2. Advanced Data Grid: In Flex Advanced Data Grid inside the application the filtration objects, Column headers and also the buttons like "Export to excel" are not identified by QTP at all. Due to this we can not perform any operation on the objects.
