Summary:
RemoteObject times out after 30 seconds every time (not fixed)
Description:
If I call a PHP script using RemoteObject and ZendAMF that takes longer than 30 seconds to complete, the request fails, even though max_execution_time on the server is more than 30 seconds.
(I believe that the max timeout on PC is 60 seconds. But on Android it is for sure only 30 seconds)
This happens with both AIR and ADL 2.6. (and 2.7)
When the request fails, Network Monitor says:
{Fault code=Channel.Call.Failed, Fault string=error, Fault detail=NetConnection.Call.Failed: HTTP: Failed, Destination=zend}
This also happens when the backend is Coldfusion Flash remoting gateway.
Seems to be connected to some sort of a max request timeout outside of the SDK.
If you follow the direction in the following link http://support.microsoft.com/kb/181050 the issue is actually resolved (only on the machine you make the change on), but it may shed some light on the core cause of this problem.
