Summary:
Issue is with the mx.charts.DateTimeAxis class
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Please add DateTimeAxis in any chart component and add min and max range to the month like min is nov,2010 and max is jan 2011 and set the direction as normal
2. Check the labels. It will reverted in the descending order but the behavior should be like it should show in ascending order.
3. The code which has issue is as follows inside the buildLabelCache() method of the class. For non inverted option as well in the else part is also treated as inverted one.
if(direction == "inverted")
labelCache.push(new AxisLabel(
1 - (dTime - computedMinimum) / r, new Date(dTime),
lfunc(labelDate, previousValue, this)));
else
labelCache.push(new AxisLabel(
1 - (dTime - computedMinimum) / r, new Date(dTime),
lfunc(labelDate, previousValue, this)));
So the correction should be in the else part the code should be like the following.
labelCache.push(new AxisLabel(
(dTime - computedMinimum) / r, new Date(dTime),
lfunc(labelDate, previousValue, this)));
Actual Results: Labels are displayed in the descending order
Expected Results: Labels should come as ascending for the dates.
Workaround (if any): If we can fix the code and rebuild the flex which right now i am not knowing how to do it but i will figure out soon as i am seeing ant build scripts and i have a experience with the same.
