Summary:
Copy From Word Document And Pasting Into TextRegion Not Working Properly
Description:
When I try to paste text which is copied from word document (two line text) into textRegion which has text already .
TextRegion has red color text , black color text and again red color text already. Now i try to paste my copied text in between red color text . First line formatted properly with same color but second line pasted in balck color.
Below is the xml.
original
--------------
<p paraStyle="Normal" textAlign="left"> <span color="#e41e26" fontSize="20">This is a JIRA Case </span></p>
After paste
----------------------
<p paraStyle="Normal" textAlign="left"> <span color="#e41e26" fontSize="20">This is a JIRAThis is first </span>
</p>
<p paraStyle="Normal" textAlign="left"> <span >This is second</span> </p>
<p paraStyle="Normal" textAlign="left"> <span color="#e41e26" fontSize="20">Case</span> </p>
Here my pasted text into text region is This is first
This is second
This happens , when copied text has CR LF (carriage return / enter character in windows), its behave like this. Otherwise its wokring fine.
Please take this case on priority and provide any kind of solution, Its blocking to my application users . Let me know if you require any more information.
Thanks
