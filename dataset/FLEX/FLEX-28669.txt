Summary:
Focusing on a TextInput in pop up does not remove the blinking text cursor in a TextInput in the main app
Description:
I think this is a regression, but I'm not sure when it last worked. This is only broken in trunk right now; it's not broken in 4.y.
Steps to reproduce:
Run this AIR desktop application:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<s:WindowedApplication xmlns:fx="http://ns.adobe.com/mxml/2009"
xmlns:s="library://ns.adobe.com/flex/spark"
xmlns:mx="library://ns.adobe.com/flex/mx">
<fx:Declarations>
<fx:Component className="MyPopUp">
<s:BorderContainer borderColor="0x00FF00" width="200" height="200">
<s:TextInput />
</s:BorderContainer>
</fx:Component>
</fx:Declarations>
<fx:Script>
<![CDATA[
import mx.managers.PopUpManager;
private var _popUp:MyPopUp;
private function rollOverHandler(event:MouseEvent):void
{ _popUp = new MyPopUp(); PopUpManager.addPopUp(_popUp, button); }
private function rollOutHandler(event:MouseEvent):void
{ PopUpManager.removePopUp(_popUp); }
]]
>
</fx:Script>
<s:Group bottom="0" >
<s:layout>
<s:VerticalLayout/>
</s:layout>
<s:TextInput id="textInput"/>
<s:Button id="button" label="Roll over for pop up!"
rollOver="rollOverHandler(event)"
rollOut="rollOutHandler(event)"/>
</s:Group>
</s:WindowedApplication>
1. Click in the TextInput, so it has a blinking cursor.
2. Roll over the Button with the mouse. This will open a pop up.
3. Press TAB to focus on the pop up's TextInput.
Actual Results:
4. The blinking text cursor will remain in the app's TextInput and there will be another blinking text cursor in the pop up's TextInput.
Expected Results:
4. Only the pop up's TextInput should have a blinking text cursor.
Workaround (if any):
None.
Other notes:
This might be related to a resolved bug SDK-30411. Not sure though.
This affects Spark ToolTips since they are based on pop ups now.
