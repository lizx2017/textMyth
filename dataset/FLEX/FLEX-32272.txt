Summary:
styleFunction not applied correctly during first expanding animation
Description:
Attached sample showing the problem.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Expand the first row, watch the animation.
2. Collapse the first row again, and expand the second row; watch the colors of the text
Actual Results:
1. During the animation, the styleFunction is not applied: text is aligned to the left. When the animation finishes, style is suddenly applied correctly: the text jumps to the center.
2. While expanding the second row, the style of hidden items (children of the first row) is applied (because it reuses the item renderers I guess). For example, the text "red" is shown in blue during the animation. Again, when the animation finishes, styles are applied correctly.
Expected Results:
Style applied correctly during animation (text aligned to the center immediately in the sample, text having correct colors).
