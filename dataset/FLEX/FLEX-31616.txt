Summary:
The set selectedCells in AdvancedDataGrid doesn't work
Description:
The code is like following:
adg is an AdvancedDataGrid
var cells:Array = this.adg.selectedCells;
for( var i:int =
beginRowIndex;i<=endRowIndex;i++ ) {
for( var j:int =
beginColumnIndex;j<=endColumnIndex;j++ )
{ var obj:Object = new Object(); obj.rowIndex = i; obj.columnIndex = j; cells.push( obj ); }
}
this.adg.selectedCells = cells;
The cells are supposed to be selected,
But in fact they aren't.
also in the debug window I saw that the selectedcells is an empty array.
Of course the screen doesn't refresh with any chang
