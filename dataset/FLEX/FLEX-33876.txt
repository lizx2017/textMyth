Summary:
Font Styles not taking effect on mx:PieCharts, mx:ColumnCharts, mx:Legends, s:Form and s:Alert
Description:
When I try to apply a css style that lives in the main application onto a sub application loaded into the main application via a SWFLoader some styles are not set. Instances like s:Label have the style applied however mx:PieChart, mx:ColumnChart and mx:Legend the style is not applied. I am only trying to apply a font to the text of these components. Things like the callouts and the text on the legends do not get the style applied to them. The same goes for s:Form the font style isn't applied to the component. The same font style is also not being applied to the title string of the s:Alert component but the body or message string the font is being applied correctly.
