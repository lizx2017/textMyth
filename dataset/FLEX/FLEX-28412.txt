Summary:
RTE and eventual app crashes when the owner of the callout is set to the first view navigator or its children
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Download the attached app.
2. Run it.
3. Click "Open Callout" button.
4. In ADL, you get the RTE. Dismiss it.
5. Click "Open Callout" button again.
Actual Results: App crashes.
First I ran this in device and didn't see the RTE so wasn't sure what happened.
Expected Results: Setting the 1st view navigator to the owner of the callout is illegal so we need to make sure this is well documented.
