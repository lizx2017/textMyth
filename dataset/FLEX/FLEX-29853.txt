Summary:
QTP 9.5 is unable to identify flash objects in IE7 when Adobe Flex 3.0 Add is used
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Install Adobe Flex 3.0 Add in for QTP
2. Record a test which has flash objects in the interface
3. Stop recording
Actual Results:
QTP doesn't identify objects and doesn't record the steps
Expected Results:
QTP should identify objects and record the steps
Workaround (if any):
Additional Info :
I was trying to automate test cases which involve the functionality with a flash interface. The interface uses the Power Upload Component provided by Element IT.
I'm using QTP 9.5 with Adobe Flex Addin 3.0 and based browser is IE7. I found that QTP is not recognizing and recording the flash objects.
Further investigating to the issue I found that QTP 9.5 with Flex Add In 3.0 are not supporting IE7.
URL for the issue: http://bugs.adobe.com/jira/browse/FLEXENT-797
Since I have to automate this functionality as soon as possible, I would like to know whether there is a patch or solution available, other than downgrading the browser to IE6.
