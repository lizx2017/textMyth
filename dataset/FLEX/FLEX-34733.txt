Summary:
Missing file in SDK (Prevents Compilation)
Description:
After Installing Flex 4.14.0 w/Air 16 a file is missing that is in Flex 4.13.0
The file is /sdk/lib/aot/lib/local/local_nostrip.arm-air.txt
Without this file, some of our projects (perhaps ones that use 64bit ANEs - untested to know for sure) - do not compile and throw the following error:
Failed to package AIR application [name].ipa
ld: can't open -non_global_symbols_no_strip_list file: [path-to-sdk]/lib/aot/lib/local_nostrip.arm-air.txt Compilation failed while executing : ld64
