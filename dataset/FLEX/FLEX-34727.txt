Summary:
ArrayList dispatches a CollectionEvent with an invalid "items" array after removeAll()
Description:
Invoking removeAll() on an ArrayList dispatches a CollectionEvent with kind = CollectionEvent.RESET. According to the documentation of the items property of CollectionEvent,
When the kind is CollectionEventKind.REFRESH or CollectionEventKind.RESET, this array has zero length.
The event dispatched from the ArrayList contains a single null item instead, which contradicts the documentation.
The issue can easily be fixed by updating ArrayList#internalDispatchEvent() to treat RESET and REFRESH events specially so the items array of the event is never updated in these cases.
