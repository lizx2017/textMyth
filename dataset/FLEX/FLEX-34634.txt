Summary:
DataGroup fires RendererExistenceEvent with a null renderer when an offscreen item is removed/replaced in the dataProvider
Description:
To me this looks like a bug in DataGroup.
It looks like a fairly easy fix. I think a null check is needed around the dispatchEvent call at: https://github.com/apache/flex-sdk/blame/930b545e0cfad5c7ae8f08cd29e21a144d08227b/frameworks/projects/spark/src/spark/components/DataGroup.as#L1766
I will attach a test case.
