Summary:
[Mosaic] Citibank: Setting loadForCompatibility True causes DataTips to render incorrectly when using Charts
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a subapplication that uses charting, turning data tips on ( attached as: ChartSubapplication.fxp )
2. Create an application to load this subapplication and position it on the screen anywhere that isn't at 0,0 ( attached as ChartFxContainer.fxp )
3. Copy the bin-debug of step 1 into the bin-debug of step 2.
4. Run the "container" created in step 2 and hover over one of the places to get a data tip.
Actual Results:
The tip will render in the wrong location. This can even render off screen entirely making the chart unusable.
Expected Results:
It should work exactly how it does when you use the chart in mxml.
Workaround (if any):
None that will always work.
