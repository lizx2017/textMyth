Summary:
Scripts generated with runtime loading are too long
Description:
Reproduction:
1. Use run time loading and record flexstore
2. Notice that the scripts are long because of the extra html wrapper
Actual Results:
Browser("Runtime Loading Sample").FlexApplication("automationExample").FlexApplication("flexstore.swf")
Expected Results:
We should provide a smaller app name for Browser and the wrapper so that the script is at least short.
Browser("flexapp").FlexApplication("app").FlexApplication("flexstore.swf")
