Summary:
Updating GroupingCollection mxml tag to GroupingCollection2 breaks app
Description:
I am about to update the Menu Maker application I built in i15.
It is giving me a warning that GroupingCollection is deprecated, use GroupingCollection2. But when I change this code to the newer version, the collection does not refresh correctly.
1. To see it work correctly, please see the app on line, http://www.finecooking.com/create-your-own-menu/thanksgiving.aspx
2. Add a couple of items
3. click menu planner, stuff is listed
4. click shopping list, stuff is listed
5. click on planner again. stuff is listed. Fine.
6. Open the attached project in i16. I set my bin-debug to /localhost/cyom/thanksgiving_09/
I gives a warning:
3608: 'GroupingCollection' has been deprecated since 4.0. Please use 'GroupingCollection2'. mm1.mxml /mm1/src line 918 Flex Problem
7. Change this tag to GroupingCollection2.
8. build & run
Repeat steps 1-5 above. The planner screen is empty. Change it back to groupingcollection. It's fine.
