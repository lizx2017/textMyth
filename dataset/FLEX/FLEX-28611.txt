Summary:
In Flex mobile project running on ADL (only), blinking text input cursor is sometimes is shorter than it should be
Description:
This seems like a runtime bug affecting Callout and/or StageText- Filing it under Callout for now.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a default Flex mobile project in builder (the one with the ViewNavigator).
2. Paste the following code into the home view:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<s:View xmlns:fx="http://ns.adobe.com/mxml/2009"
xmlns:s="library://ns.adobe.com/flex/spark"
title="HomeView">
<s:CalloutButton>
<s:TextInput left="20" right="20" top="20" bottom="20"/>
</s:CalloutButton>
</s:View>
3. Run it in any ADL simulator (I reproduced the bug on the Nexus One simulator as well as the iPhone 4 simulator).
4. Tap the Button in the view.
5. Tap the TextInput in the Callout. The blinking text input cursor should be normal height.
6. Tap the anywhere outside of the Callout on the view.
7. Tap the Button in the view.
8. Tap the TextInput in the Callout.
Actual Results:
9. The blinking text input cursor is now approximately half as tall as it should be (as it was before).
Expected Results:
9. The blinking text input cursor is the normal height, as before.
Workaround (if any):
Run it on a device. The bug only occurs in ADL. I ran ADL on Mac OS X 10.6.8.
I verified that this sequence of steps produces the expected results on a Nexus One running Android 2.3.4 and a Motorola XOOM running Android 3.2.
