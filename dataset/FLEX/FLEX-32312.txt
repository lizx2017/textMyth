Summary:
Rapid data entry in Advanced Data Grid loses keystrokes.
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create an advanced data grid with a large number of columns, all of which specify an item renderer.
2. Double click in a cell, for example cell 1, 1 to begin editing.
3. Using the numpad, enter the following text as fast as as possible: 1 1 Enter 2 2 Enter 3 3 Enter 4 4 Enter 5 5 Enter and so on.
4. The attached project demonstrates this behavior.
Actual Results:
Some key strokes are "lost", the data does not show up in the grid. For example, if you entered 11, 22, 33 and so on in the cells for a row, you might end up with the following: "11", "22", "44", "55", "88".
Expected Results:
Each cell will have the appropriate text, "11", "22", "33", "44", etc...
