Problem Description:
mx:Label htmlText sometimes disappear when FTE is enabled.
Refer to https://bugs.adobe.com/jira/browse/FP-5598, the regression bug is NOT fully fixed in FP 10.1/10.2/10.3.
In FP 10.0 + Flex 4.0, it works fine.
In FP 10.1/10.2 + Flex 4.0, all the FTE htmlText usages (including regular MX Component's FTE) will randomly disappear.
In FP 10.3 + Flex 4.5.1, lb1.htmlText = "<font color='#ff00ff'>xy</font>"; still disappears, but <mx:Label id="lb1" x="10" y="200" text="" /> works fine.
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Compile attached Test.mxml with FTE enable for MX Components.
2. Open the Test.swf in Browser.
3. Continuously refresh the swf.
Actual Result:
The mx label (lb1) with htmlText disappears.
Expected Result:
The mx label (lb1) with htmlText should be visible.
Any Workarounds:
Use UIFTETextField instead.
