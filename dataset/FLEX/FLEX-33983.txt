Summary:
mxmlc -version shows the wrong version
Description:
mxmlc -version shows "Version 4.10.0 build 0" but it should show "Version 4.11.0 build 20131017" instead. It looks like this is a redundancy problem. For stability reasons it would make more sense if the version number would be read from only one place.
