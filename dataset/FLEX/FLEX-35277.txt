Summary:
Apps created using Flex crashes on iOS
Description:
When I updated from AIR 22 to a higher version my app no longer loads on iOS. It crashes after it has loaded the locally packaged swf files required to run the app and then it attempts to use them.

Please help us push Adobe to fix this issue. Please give a vote and add comment at the Tracker. I'll really appreciate it.
PS: As you remember I've created topic Re: Multidex support for Adobe AIR and we together forced Adobe add this feature. Now look at http://fpdownload.macromedia.com/pub/labs/flashruntimes/shared/air25_flashplayer25_release notes.pdf they've finally added Multidex support for Android. We're power! Thank you so much!
Please help us one more time!

PPS: I've checked this issue with last AIR SDK Release (25.0.0.126) and Flex 4.16.0. It doesn't work.
