Summary:
Installer Failed with "could not delete Temporary Folder"
Description:
After installing the Apache Flex 4.9.1 SDK and then the AIR 3.4 SDK, the installation process aborted. In the log it said it couldn't delete temporary folders. Successive attempts always fail.
NB - when I checked the temp folder in the SDK folder was still there - the AF SDK zip was there but not the AIR one... I downloaded the AIR sdk manually and after putting airglobal.swc in the right place managed to compile a windows desktop AIR app. Install Log is below. I marked this as minor as a colleague was able to install on a Windows 7 machine this morning without any issues. One thing I should also point out - just before the abort occurs I get a Windows Virtual Memory minimum is too low message. I have a gig of ram allocated to virtual box, and apart from Win Rar - the installer (and AIR) are the only applications running.
Version 2.5.4 (windows)
Fetched the SDK download mirror URL from the CGI.
