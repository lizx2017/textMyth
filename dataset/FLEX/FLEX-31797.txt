Summary:
ColumnChart hangs when DateTimeAxis.maximum is not null, AxisRenderer.canDropLabels is false, and ColumnChart.series is null or empty array
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
Compile and run the following application:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<mx:Application xmlns:mx="http://www.adobe.com/2006/mxml" creationComplete="onCreation()">
<mx:Script>
<![CDATA[
[Bindable] private var chartSeries:Array = null;
[Bindable] private var dp:Array = null;
private function onCreation():void
{ // Setup dp and chartSeries in response to web services / SQL calls / etc. }
]]
>
</mx:Script>
<mx:ColumnChart dataProvider="
{dp}
" series="
{chartSeries}
">
<mx:horizontalAxis>
<mx:DateTimeAxis id="dateAxis" labelUnits="days" maximum="
{new Date()}
"/>
</mx:horizontalAxis>
<mx:horizontalAxisRenderers>
<mx:AxisRenderer axis="
{dateAxis}
" canDropLabels="false"/>
</mx:horizontalAxisRenderers>
</mx:ColumnChart>
</mx:Application>
Actual Results:
Application hangs immediately on startup.
Expected Results:
Application should display an empty chart.
Workaround (if any):
Change just about anything, then when series is set, change back programmatically, then make sure that exact combination does not occurr again (or else it will still hang).
Specifally, the combination is this:
DateTimeAxis with labelUnits set, and a maximum set.
AxisRenderer with canDropLabels set to false.
ColumnChart.series is an empty array or null.
Vary any of the above and it works as expected. I'm guessing that the issue is related to the DateTimeAxis / AxisRenderer controls getting into an infinite loop while trying the determine the date labels to display.
I have not tested this with other chart types - it may not be specific to ColumnCharts.
