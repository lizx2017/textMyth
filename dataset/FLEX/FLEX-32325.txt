Summary:
HierarchicalCollectionView doesn't handle changed children collection
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Add a new child node to the children collection of a node in hierarchicalData.
2. Remove the node you just added and also set the children collection to null since there are no children.
3. Assign a new ArrayCollection to the children of the same node and add a new node.
Actual Results:
The new node from step 3 got added to the old children collection instead of the new one.
Expected Results:
The new children collection should have been used and the new node should be visible.
Workaround (if any):
In step 3 assign the old ArrayCollection which got removed in step 2 in order to see the newly added node from step 3.
See attached demo for an example. Steps for the demo:
1. Add a new node as child of "3".
2. Remove the node "3.1" you just added from "3".
3. Add a new node as child of "3" one more time. In the left ADG it won't show up. In the right one it will be visible because of the workaround.
Why I need this to work? Nodes that don't have children shouldn't not display the icon for expand/collapse. The only way I could manage to do this is by adding nodes where "children" is null. Therefore I need to set the children collection to null when the last child got removed. My current workaround is no real solution since I have to store all original children collections.
