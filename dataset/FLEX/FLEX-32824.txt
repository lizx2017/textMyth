Summary:
RTE - getFieldSortInfo -- AdvancedDataGridSortItemRenderer & AdvancedDataGridHeaderRenderer
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Disable sortExpertMode on the grid.
2. Create two sets of data for two different dataProviders
3. Create two Array's of AdvancedDataGridColumns with a different number of columns, all columns set to different data fields. Set one might have 25 columns, the second 6.
4. Change the columns and dataProvider from one set to the next.
In the application we encountered this, there are 20-30 columns per set, on average there are 5-8 visible the rest you have to scroll to.
Actual Results:
Runtime error occurs when going from the larger set of columns. This is due to no null check in the renderers or in AdvancedDataGrid to see if the column exists in the columns array prior to attempting to read data off the column. Typically due to a header renderer for a column that was visible, but that column is not available in the columns array.
Expected Results:
See line 6839 - 6841 in AdvancedDataGrid.as
Workaround (if any):
public function getFieldSortInfo(column:AdvancedDataGridColumn):SortInfo
{
if(!column)
{ return null; }
... current logic below.
}
