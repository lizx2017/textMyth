Summary:
AdvancedDataGrid: Focus navigation in cells not consistent to column navigation behavior
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. open the attached mxml file.
2. move the focus into the advanced data grid (lower table) by using tab keys.
3. move the focus among the list items using the vertical arrow keys.
4. move the focus into the column header area.
5. move the focus using the left and right arrow keys
6. recognize how the focus moves among the columns.
7. use the arrow key down to move the focus back into the list items content.
8. use the left and right arrow keys now. This does not change the selection nor does it show a focus visual.
Actual Results:
The focus within the column area acts different to the list items area.
Expected Results:
The focus should act consistently. A good use case is the Microsoft Windows list control, as provided within the Windows Vista or Windows 7 Explorer and it's files list on the right side of the window. Use left and right there, the focus changes between the columns while the selection keeps on the same list item. A screen reader can now announce the focused column-based cell instead of announcing the full list item.
