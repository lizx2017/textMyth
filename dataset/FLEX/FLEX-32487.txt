Summary:
Switching the axis direction to inverted \ Normal at runtime gives incorrect results(-ve values)
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a new Flex project using following combination: sdk: 4.0.0.6195 dmv:231116
2. copy the mxml code from the attached file (invertedAxis_bug.mxml)
3. Run the application
4. Click on the radio button "Direction=inverted"
Actual Results: We can observe that in the linear axis, the values have changed from +ve to -ve
Expected Results: only the direction should change. Minimum value should go on the top and maximum value should come to the bottom of the veritcalAxis
Workaround (if any): include the same data provider again on the click of the radio button. Things will work fine
Workaround also has been attached (invertedAxis_workaround.mxml)
