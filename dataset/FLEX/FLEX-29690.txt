Summary:
Flex Data Grid Selection using indexes for Flex Applications
Description:
I donno whether or not this post belongs to this group ... pls correct me if I am wrong and also suggest where to post questions on how 2s..
QTP - After lot of research I found out that there is no such method defined to select a data grid using indexes for Flex data grids in Flex applications as in the case of VB applications and .Net applications. Is there any fix vailable for this issue as we have dynamic values in data grid and those records need to be selected based on indexs. To select the record I need to know the complete row values as shown in the attachment which is very annnoying.
