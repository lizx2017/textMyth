Description:
Customer reported performance problem (via Heidi and http://forums.adobe.com/thread/918527).
From Email Exchange with Evtim:

Workaround (if any):
Set mouseEnabledWhereTransparent=false on the Group and add an invisible hit-testing Rect:
<s:Group mouseEnabledWhereTransparent="false">
<s:Rect width="100%" height="100%">
<s:fill>
<s:SolidColor color="white" alpha="0" />
</s:fill>
</s:Rect>
...
</s:Group>
