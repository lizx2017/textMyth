Summary:
When changing PieSeries "field" property to a dataprovider with zeros, old labels are not being hidden correctly
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Compile and run attached bug file (make sure the datavisualization.swc is in your build path)
2. Change the ComboBox in the upper-left corner from "SB" (Stolen bases) to "CS" (Caught stealing).
3. in the lower right portion of the screen there is an old label for "R Klesko" which still shows "R Klesko SB: 5"
Actual Results:
After changing the combo box the old label is still visible.
I believe this is because the previous pie chart was showing 5 items and the new pie chart is only showing 4 items. If i change the XML in the data provider and change a 0 to 1 in the @cs attribute, the chart renders as expected (although now with incorrect data)
Expected Results:
The old label should be removed.
