Summary:
Huge performances problems on sqlite view selection in AIR 3.0
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. create a sqlite database with several tables and make some views (using "DISTINCT" statement) to see recordings
2. make a selection on this view using "SQLStatement" in AIR 2.7
3. make a selection on this view using "SQLStatement" in AIR 3.0 and compare performances.
Actual Results:
Air 2.0 is more than 100 times faster then AIR 3.0 to execute the selection
Expected Results:
Air 3.0 should be as fast as Air 2.0
