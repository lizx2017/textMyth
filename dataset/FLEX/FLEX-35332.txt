Summary:
Source maps in MXML broken because directive uses incorrect .mxml.map extension
Description:
Looks like this:
//# sourceMappingURL=./SourceMapsFlexJS.mxml.map
Should be this:
//# sourceMappingURL=./SourceMapsFlexJS.js.map
Interestingly, VSCode still works with the wrong extension, so it must figure out that the MXML maps to JS in a different way.
