Summary:
Data binding doesn't work for visible property if the property is changed when the component is not initialized yet.
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Launch attached application TEST.mxml
Actual Results:
Button is invisible. Label says Button.visible=true
Expected Results:
Button is invisible. Label says Button.visible=false
Comment:
This issue can happen quite often when we have popup with states which applied before popup is initialized.
Root cause of the bug: First initial value for data binding is applied. It is 'true' at the moment. Then state "buttonInvisible" is applied and button.visible property is set to false. But the button is not initialized yet, so, check in setVisible function (line 3264 in UIComponent.as) is failed and event dispatching doesn't happen. So, label remains with initial binding value.
I see two possible solutions:
1. Dispatch SHOW/HIDE event irrelevant of initialized property
2. add "creationComplete" as the 3rd event for binding visible property.
