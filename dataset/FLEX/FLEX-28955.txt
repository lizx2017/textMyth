Summary:
Impossible to restrict input using TextInput and TextInputSkin on the iPad
Description:
Flex 4.6.0
On a recent job we required a TextInput field where the user could enter an amount of money. Although using TextInput.restrict i could restrict the charecters entered (0-9.) I also needed to limit the number of "." characters to a single character and the number of decimal places after this character to 2.
I added a listener for TextOperationEvent.CHANGING so that I could stop text being entered and this worked fine when testing on desktop, but once running on the iPad this event never gets dispatched.
I then added a listener for TextOperationEvent.CHANGE (not ideal), to alter the text once it had been entered and re-assign it back to the text property. Again this worked fine when testing on desktop, but although the event gets dispatched on the iPad, re-assigning the text has no effect when TextInputSkin is used.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run the attached project.
Actual Results:
1. TextOperationEvent.CHANGING is never dispatched when running on the iPad.
2. Re-assigning a String to the "text" property after it has just been changed via user input does not work on the iPad.
Expected Results:
1. TextOperationEvent.CHANGING should be dispatched.
2. Re-assigning a String to the "text" property after it has just been changed via user input should work as it does on desktop.
Workaround (if any): None found and we were not able to implement this feature meaning users could enter all sorts of nonsense in this field that was supposed to be restricted to a currency amount. the only thing we could do was change the text once focus was lost.
The other workaround is to use the default StageTextInputSkin. Although this still never dispatches the TextOperationEvent.CHANGING event, it does allow the re-assignment of a String to the text property. StageTextInputSkin doesn't honour embedded fonts though (https://bugs.adobe.com/jira/browse/SDK-32023).
