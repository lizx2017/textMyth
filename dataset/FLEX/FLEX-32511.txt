Summary:
when the headerHeight property of Advanced Data Grid is made 0 And the visible property is toggled from true to false. The column separator of the data grid behaves weirdly .
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a Flex Project. Under src create a folder as data then add tasks.xml (attached) to the data folder. Copy HeaderHeight.mxml in the src folder (attached). Now run it.
2. Resize the window to a smaller size than full screen (say a width of 800 pixels or less). Toggle the check box in the application, some columns are hidden/unhidden.
3. See the attached screen-shot (attached)
Actual Results: The values go over the column separators to the next column.
Expected Results: The values should not go over the column separator
