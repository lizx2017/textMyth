Summary:
Embedded font not used by AxisRenderer
Description:
Steps to reproduce (see Test.mxml):
1. In FlashBuilder 4.5:
2. Create a simple bar chart with a vertical axis title and categories
3. Embed a font and use CSS to assign this to the mx|AxisRenderer
Actual Results (see actual.png):
The axis title uses the embedded font, but the axis labels do not (they revert to a serif font)
Expected Results:
The embedded font should be used for both axis title and label
Workaround (if any):
None that I can find; best is not to specify any font, and it will use a default sans-serif (Arial I suspect). Strangly enough it works perfectly in FlashBuilder 4
