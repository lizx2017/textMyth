Alternatively:
1. Place AdvancedDataGrid in blank project
2. Build a class that holds one date
3. In main application build an ArrayCollection that is made up of one or more class objects created in step 2
4. make the ArrayCollection bindable and bind it to the dataprovider of the AdvancedDataGrid.
5. on the "creationComplete" method populate the class with a date and add that class object to the ArrayCollection created in step 4
6. Ensure you have a column defined that is mapped to the dataelement within the class. Add a dateformatter to the column.
7. Run the application

The formatted data column has the wrong date, it shows a year of "700" instead of "2007"
Expected Results:
The formatted date column properly displays the year
Background Information:
I'm working on a system with GMT -7 set. This is part of the date object, and my be different for others who test this out. In the attached program, i've also formatted the date for display in some labels. In that instance everything works great. I've also attached my system information as generated by Flex 3 Builder Beta 2 under Help\Product Details, then i clicked on "Configuration Details"
