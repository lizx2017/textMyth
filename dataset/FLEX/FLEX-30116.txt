Summary:
Overriding FlexTextArea's Input method does not works in QTP
Description:
I am trying to select the existing text(if there is any) and input new text in the FlexTextArea using the Input method by RegisterUserFunction. It throws an error stating 'Object doesn't support this property or method: 'obj.Input'"MySet=obj.Input "'. I believe this is a valid method for the FlexTextArea class object. The SelectText method works fine but there is some problem with the Input method. Please help to resolve this.
Note: The Input method works fine if i do not Register it with any of my fuctions.
'***************************************************
Function MySet (obj, x)

y = obj.GetROProperty("text")
MySet = obj.SelectText (0, Len)
Reporter.ReportEvent micDone, "previous value", y
MySet=obj.Input
End Function

RegisterUserFunc "FlexTextArea", "Input", "MySet"
Browser("Browser").FlexApplication("someName").FlexCanvas("someName").FlexPanel("someName").FlexForm("someName").FlexTextArea("someName").Input "TestInput"
