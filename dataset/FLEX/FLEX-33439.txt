Summary:
copylocale utility not working for locales other than english
Description:
This is broken in the 4.9.1 release as well. When I use the copylocale utility to try and copy a locale like zh_TW to z1_TW, I get these errors:
Error: Directory "./../frameworks/projects/airspark/bundles/zh_TW" does not exist
Error: Directory "./../frameworks/projects/automation_air/bundles/zh_TW" does not exist
Error: Directory "./../frameworks/projects/automation_dmv/bundles/zh_TW" does not exist
Error: Directory "./../frameworks/projects/automation_flashflexkit/bundles/zh_TW" does not exist
Error: Directory "./../frameworks/projects/automation_spark/bundles/zh_TW" does not exist
Error: Directory "./../frameworks/projects/mobilecomponents/bundles/zh_TW" does not exist
If I use the en_US locale as the one to copy, it works fine, but this is not the expected result. I should be able to copy any locale. This is currently preventing me from deploying to a certain locale. I'm not aware of any workaround.
