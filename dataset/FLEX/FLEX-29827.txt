Summary:
Delay in enabling object property for Script user
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1.From the QTP script launch an application and wait for a FlexTitleWindow to be visible ie., WaitProperty "visible", True
2. Set a breakpoint at the above script statement
3. Run the script
4. Script launches the application and breakpoint is hit
5. Single step thru the breakpoint
Actual Results:
WaitProperty "visible", True returns about 5-6 seconds BEFORE the FlexTitleWindow appears
Expected Results:
WaitProperty should return only when the FlexTitleWindow is physically visible to the user
Workaround (if any):
Wait a random amount of time for the FlexTitleWindow to be visible (not a feasible solution)
