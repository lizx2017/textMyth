Summary:
Datagrid goes blank when assigning new dataProvider.source and calling refresh
Description:
Given a spark DataGrid with an ArrayCollection dataProvider, the DataGrid can erroneously go blank in the following situation:
the DataGrid has been scrolled down so it is not at the very top.
the .source property is changed on the dataProvider to be a new Array where the new values in the Array are also different objects to the objects in the previous .source Array.
.refresh() is called on the DataGrid
This is possibly the same bug as FLEX-33066.
I will attach a minimal test case.
