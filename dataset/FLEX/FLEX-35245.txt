Summary:
toString method is already in place for a new object
Description:
If you create a class and try to attach a method toString with some vars, compiler said:
Incorrect number of arguments. Expected no more than 0
var str:String = ObjectUtil.toString(value);
This is because FlexJS think the new class has already a toString() method, but that's not true since the class does not extend anything
