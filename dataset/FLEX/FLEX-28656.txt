Workaround (if any):
1)We had previous issue of Combobox mirroring(reversed).We fixed it by
<mx:WindowedApplication xmlns:fx="http://ns.adobe.com/mxml/2009"
creationComplete="init();"
layoutDirection="ltr" direction="ltr">
<mx:Style>
global
{ direction: ltr; layoutDirection: ltr; }

</mx:Style>
2)After these changes we are facing this new issue.
