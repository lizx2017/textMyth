Summary:
Huge lag on only the first state change of a basic application.
Description:
Steps to reproduce in the uploaded application:
1.Click the "show list state" button
2.Click the "back" button"
3.Click the "show list state" button
4.Observe the trace output
Actual Results:
time to show list state:84
time to go back:2
time to show list state:5
Expected Results:
time to show list state:5
time to go back:2
time to show list state:5
Notes--
*The item creation policy is set to immediate, so the lag is not from instantiation. Even if it was, it should not take 80 ms to instantiate a List component with only 2 data items and no custom rendering/skins.
*This lag is also re-producable if you replace the <s:List/> with a <mx:BarChart/>, and as before, the lag only occurs the first time you change the state.
