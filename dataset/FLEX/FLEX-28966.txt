Summary:
Adobe hosted RSLs always fail due to crossdomain policy
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Clear FP cached RSL via http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager03.html
2. Run a debug SWF that uses Adobe hosted RSLs
Actual Results:
Every time I get the following error: Error: Ignoring policy file at http://fpdownload.adobe.com/pub/swz/crossdomain.xml due to meta-policy 'by-content-type'.
The Adobe hosted RSLs are not used and so the failover RSLs are always used.
Expected Results:
I would expect the Adobe hosted RSLs to be used. At least most of the time.
Workaround (if any):
Having proper failovers does what it's supposed to.
Also I noticed that the master crossdomain file at http://fpdownload.adobe.com/crossdomain.xml
...contains:
<site-control permitted-cross-domain-policies="by-content-type"/>
And the crossdomain for the RSLs at http://fpdownload.adobe.com/pub/swz/crossdomain.xml
... is served with content type "text/xml". According to the docs it should be served with "text/x-cross-domain-policy".
