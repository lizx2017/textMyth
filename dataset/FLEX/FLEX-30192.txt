Summary:
Container uses label instead of automationName
Description:
ContainerAutomationImpl prefers using the label as automationName instead of an explicitly set automationName. This means that setting an automationName on a container simply doesn't work if it also has a label.
For example with <mx:HBox label="some function" automationName="foobarBox" />, the "foobarBox" is never used.
When a container has both a label and an automationName set, the expected behaviour is clearly that it would use the automationName (you wouldn't set an automationName if you wanted it to figure out a name automatically).
The solution is to change ContainerAutomationImpl.automationValue getter to first check if container.automationName is non-empty, and if it is return that (just like super.automationValue would):
override public function get automationValue():Array
{
if (container.automationName && container.automationName.length != 0)
return [container.automationName];
if (container.label ...
}
With that change it uses the automationName if it was explicitly set, and still uses the label (or a combination of its children automation values,...) if there is no automationName.
(Note that the ContainerAutomationImpl.automationName getter should not be changed, it should still prefer container.label over super.automationName.)
