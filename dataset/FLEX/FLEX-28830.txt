Summary:
Rendering anomalies appear when running in 16-bit mode with attached project
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Open the attached FXP and run on a XOOM
2. Scroll the list
Actual Results:
There is drit appearing about 10 pixels to the left of the scrollbar. The attached file shows a simple version of this quality issue, but the screenshot of our full application shows it much more clearly (And severely)
Expected Results:
Clean rendering
Workaround (if any):
This does not occur if rendered in 32-bit mode (16-bit is the default for Flex mobile projects due to the incredible performance hit from running w/ 32-bit rendering)
