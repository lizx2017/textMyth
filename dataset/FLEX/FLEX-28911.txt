Summary:
EncryptedLocalStore not supported in iOS simulator or on device via "Fast Packaging"
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Build an app that accesses the EncryptedLocalStore
2. Debug app in simulator or on hardware with "Fast Packaging"
3. Run app and trigger ELS access functionality.
Actual Results:
EncryptedLocalStore.isSupported == false in the iOS simulator
EncryptedLocalStore.isSupported == false on iOS with "Fast Packaging"
EncryptedLocalStore.isSupported == true on iOS when exported as release build.
Expected Results:
EncryptedLocalStore.isSupported == true in the iOS simulator
EncryptedLocalStore.isSupported == true on iOS with "Fast Packaging"
EncryptedLocalStore.isSupported == true on iOS when exported as release build.
Workaround (if any):
This is a serious bullet to the head for debugging an app that uses ELS. You have no choice but to mock all your ELS access if you want to debug your app.
