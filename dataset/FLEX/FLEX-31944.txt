Summary:
AdvancedDataGrid remains scrolled up after resizing, and enough space is available to display the whole contents
Description:
The table on the left is an AdvancedDataGrid, on the right a DataGrid.
It is not only a usability issue, because the value of maxVerticalScrollPosition is also incorrect during the operation (and this is what I am primarily interested in).
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run the attached sample
2. Resize the window so the vertical scrollbar becomes visible
3. Scroll both tables up to the top
4. Resize the window to their initial size
Actual Results:
a. The AdvancedDataGrid remains scrolled up, and its vertical scrollbar remains visible. The scroll bar will remain until component the whole content of the data grid is visible and the component is resized.
Expected Results:
The AdvancedDataGrid should expose its scrolled content like the data grid does when it is resized. The vertical scroll bar should be removed.
