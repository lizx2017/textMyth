Summary:
QTPAdapter traces Nullpointer without any hint ([trace] QTPAdapter:QTPAdapter() - null, QTPAdapter:useErrorHandler() - null) and automation stops working.
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a custom Spark component (I think it is realted to skinnableComponent)
2. Try to automate it
Actual Results:
Custom Spark components sometimes are not able to automate.
When debugging Nullpointer exceptions ([trace] QTPAdapter:QTPAdapter() - null; [trace] QTPAdapter:useErrorHandler() - null) are logged but there is no hint on what type of object is related. This makes it really hard/impossible to find out what to do.
Expected Results:
There should be at least an information on which object/method caused the Nullpointer so that it could be fixed.
