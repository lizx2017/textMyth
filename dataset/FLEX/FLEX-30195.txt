Summary:
Automation projects have unncessary resource properties files
Description:
The SVN automation projects (automation, automation_air, automation_dmv, automation_flashflexkit, and automation_spark) all have copies of some of the resource bundle properties files found in the framework project. These versions are overriding the ones found in the framework project.
These duplicate resource bundle properties files should be removed from the repository. This needs to be done for all locales, not just en_US.
