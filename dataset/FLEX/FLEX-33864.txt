Summary:
spark DataGrid drag and drop on empty grid causes RangeError
Description:
I found a problem while dragging an item from one grid to another grid which has no items.
As far as I understand the code the calculated dropIndex in LayoutBase should be 0 and it is 1. The method looks like this:
protected function calculateDropIndex(x:Number, y:Number):int
{ // Always add to the end by default. return target.numElements; }
If there is already an item in the target DataGrid the problem does not occur.
Also headers are not shown in the empty grid
