Summary:
HierarchicalCollectionView only accepts sort fields of type mx.collections.SortField instead of any ISortField implementation
Description:
I have written an extension of HierarchicalCollectionView which implements the IList interface such that I can make use of hierarchical data in the various Spark data controls (primarily to allow implementation of a spark tree data grid).
HierarchicalCollectionView accepts a sort property of type ISort and is supplied an instance of spark.collections.sort by my data grid. This is all fine, except that it's sortCanBeApplied function explicitly expects sort fields of type mx.collections.SortField where in this case I actually have instances of spark.collections.SortField.
The fix for this is trivial in that sortCanBeApplied should in fact be expecting sort fields of type ISortField.
ie. var sf:SortField = sort.fields[i]; should read var sf:ISortField = sort.fields[i];
I've kludged around this by converting all the sort fields to mx.collections.SortField in my class, but it's a long way from pleasant and I'd appreciate it being fixed properly!
