Description:
Steps to reproduce:

2. Record a QTP test to automate testing of DateField including opening of the DateField to select a date
3. Attempt to execute the test in QTP as a sub-function.
Actual Results:
Run-time exception
Error: Unable to find automation method 'open' for class 'name: FlexDateField
