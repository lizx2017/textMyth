Summary:
Right black screen on galaxy note 10.1 when rotating
Description:
Create a simple Mobile FLEX project, and just add a spark textInput.
Launch your project on Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1, set the focus on the textInput, the keyboard appears.
Rotate to the landscape mode, the right part of the screen is black.
We tried it with a Samsung Galaxy tab 2, there is no bug.
We tried too with Apache FLEX 4.9.0 and AIR 3.5 => no bug.
