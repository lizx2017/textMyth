Summary:
Keyboard selection doesn't work in closed combobox
Description:
Selecting (custom) text using the keyboard in a closed combobox doesn't work.
Steps to reproduce:
Compile and run the following application
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<s:WindowedApplication xmlns:fx="http://ns.adobe.com/mxml/2009"
xmlns:s="library://ns.adobe.com/flex/spark"
xmlns:mx="library://ns.adobe.com/flex/mx">
<s:Group>
<s:layout><s:HorizontalLayout /></s:layout>
<s:ComboBox id="myCombo" width="200" >
<s:dataProvider>
<mx:ArrayList>
<fx:String>test1</fx:String>
<fx:String>test2</fx:String>
<fx:String>test3</fx:String>
</mx:ArrayList>
</s:dataProvider>
</s:ComboBox>
<s:TextInput id="myText" width="200" />
</s:Group>
</s:WindowedApplication>
Click in the combo box and type "abc" (w/out quotes) and then press enter.
Press shift + end
Actual: The text input contains the value "test3" and the cursor remains at the start of the text. No selection has been made.
Expected: The text input should contain the value "abc" and that text should be selected (cursor located after the letter "c").
The reason lies in DropDownListBase::keyDownHandler between lines 784 and 855, which allows vertical keyboard navigation in the (closed) combo/dropdown control. However, it ignores the status of the "shift" key (and incidentally also of the "alt", "ctrl", and "command" keys), which indicate different behaviour.
In the case of a pressed shift key no navigation should occur, instead, at least for HOME and END keys the text should be selected accordingly.
