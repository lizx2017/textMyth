Summary:
AdvancedDataGridBaseEx method focusInHandler causes error in editable grids
Description:
We encountered this in the Brainstorm project (BrainstormDev@adobe.com). I tried to write a very simple Flex app with an ADG in it to reproduce, but it didn't reproduce it.
What is necessary on the AdvancedDataGrid:
editable=true
displayItemsExpanded=false
probably something else, since my test app didn't reproduce it. Not sure what this would be, though.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Expand the first item in the grid
2. Close the first item in the grid
Actual:
TypeError: Error #1010: A term is undefined and has no properties.

Expected: no error.
As I debugged this, I found that the focusInHandler was setting _editedItemPosition in a loop, looking for the right one. If it finds what it's after, it calls setEditedItemPosition(_editedItemPosition), which seems redundant, since that just sets _editedItemPosition again. However, in this case it's not finding what it's after since we're not editing anything at the moment, so _editedItemPosition is left set to the loop values, which has a column index of 1 greater than the last column index. This invalid value of _editedItemPosition is what causes the action script error above.
It only happens on the first item in the grid because of a check in collectionChangeHandler, on line 5349:
else if (ceEvent.location <= editedItemPosition.rowIndex) <-- this passes for the first item in the grid, but not others, which causes the call that hits the above error.
I created a workaround that sets editedItemPosition to null when we lose focus, and it seems to work. What would be better is if focusInHandler either didn't use _editedItemPosition as its temporary loop pointer, or if it didn't find what it was after, set it to null or something.
If you need help reproducing this, let me know.
