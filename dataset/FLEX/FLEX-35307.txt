Summary:
Maven distribution does not include framework source files in frameworks/projects
Description:
The original ActionScript source files and related resources (like the manifest.xml files) for each project in the framework should be included in a distribution of FlexJS created with Maven.
For example, the files in this directory are missing from the distribution:
frameworks/projects/Basic/src/main
(it's the same for other projects too, like Express or Collections, and the directory above is just one example)
Additionally, this change will be helpful for consolidating the manifest.xml files used in the builds. The Maven distribution currently duplicates the manifest.xml files from each project in frameworks/projects to distribution/src/main/resources/manifests. This causes files like flex-config.xml to need special modifications for the Maven distribution to use different paths. If the Maven distribution includes the manifest.xml files in their original location (which correctly follows the Maven directory structure, like Basic/src/main/resources/basic-manifest.xml), then it can use the same flex-config.xml as the Ant distribution.
Ideally, both would bundle the same flex-config.xml file from the same location in the repository (like the manifest.xml files, the -config.xml files are duplicated in distribution/src/main/resources for Maven). However, even if the files come from different locations in the repo for Ant and Maven, if their contents can be exactly the same, that would still be an improvement. As it is, the manifest files need to be duplicated, then the -config.xml files, and then the -config.xml files need to be modified.
