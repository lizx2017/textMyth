Summary:
TextInput on iOS doesn't show the selection bar when focus in and soft keyboard is disabled
Description:
I want to use my own numeric keyboard for textInput. so on a textInput, I add the listener softKeyboardActivating and make a preventDefault to not show the keyboard.
I use for TextInput the "spark.skins.mobile.TextInputSkin".
I will attach a project to test the case, you will see the selection bar on Android and PC, but not on iOS.
Is it possible to modify the skin in order to show the selection bar without show the keyboard ?
