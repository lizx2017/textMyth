Summary:
TileLayout scrolling is worst (v slow) on many android devices including Nexus 7 and Nexus 10
Description:
Hi,
my app which shows 100 160x160 images on a tile layout works great on iOS,
but on many devices even Nexus 7 or Nexus 10 scrolling is very very slow. We cant launch the product with this. However vertical layout is much much better on same devices.
It looks like TileList require a rewrite for mobile devices. I even specified fixed values to columns, and tile sizes which are all 160x160 (no variable heights/widths). but still its pretty slow.
I'd appreciate if you guys incorporate a mobile friendly Tilelayout for Flex 4.10, which provide fixed sizes of tiles and scroll as fast as vertical layout.
Thanks
