Summary:
AccImpl creates a named accessibility object with the role 'graphic' for each spark.components.supportClasses.GroupBase descendant child of a Form or FormItem
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create an MXML application like the example attached, that contains either a spark or mx Form, one or more nested FormItems, and, within a FormItem, one or more HGroup or VGroup containers.
For example:
<s:Form id="form1" horizontalCenter="0" verticalCenter="0">
<s:FormItem label="Circle of Hell">
<s:layout>
<s:HorizontalLayout/>
</s:layout>
<s:VGroup width="50%">
<s:RadioButton label="1: Limbo"/>
<s:RadioButton label="3: Gluttony"/>
<s:RadioButton label="5: Anger"/>
<s:RadioButton label="7: Violence"/>
<s:RadioButton label="9: Treachery"/>
</s:VGroup>
<s:VGroup width="50%">
<s:RadioButton label="2: Lust"/>
<s:RadioButton label="4: Greed"/>
<s:RadioButton label="6: Heresy"/>
<s:RadioButton label="8: Fraud"/>
</s:VGroup>
</s:FormItem>
</s:Form>
2. Publish the application and open it in InternetExplorer on Windows with either a screen reader or an MSAA testing tool running.
3. Examine the swf with the MSAA testing tool or read through the contents of the swf with the screen reader.
Actual Results:
An additional accessibility object with the role 'graphic' will appear in the accessibility tree for each spark.components.supportClasses.GroupBase descendant child of a FormItem. It will be labeled with the FormItem label. I've attached an image demonstrating the behavior.
Expected Results:
The GroupBase components should probably be treated like SkinnableContainer or mx|Container components and not be added to the accessible content.
Workaround (if any):
The fix is to modify mx.accessibility.AccImpl by adding spark.components.supportClasses.GroupBase and spark.components.Scroller to the "Container" typeMap item used to determine components that should not add the FormItem name when building the component instances accessibilityName.
