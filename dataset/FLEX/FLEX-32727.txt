Summary:
Advanced Data Grid Column Coloring issue on scrolling
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create an advanced data grid with 5 or 6 columns and size it in such a way that you can see a horizontal scrollbar
2. Set a default background color for a column
3. scroll horizontally
Actual Results:
The background color on the column where it has been set by default vanishes
Expected Results:
The background color stays on scrolling
Workaround (if any):
Overiding function drawColumnBackGround and commenting out the the following lines of code makes the behavior correct.
/*
if(columnIndex >= lockedColumnCount &&
columnIndex < lockedColumnCount + horizontalScrollPosition)
return;
*/
I have attached a sample mxml to replicate the issue.
