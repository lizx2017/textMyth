Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Compile and run attached source code.
Actual Results:
labels on the vertical axis (player names) slant from top-left to bottom-right.
labels on the horizontal axis (stats) slant from the bottom-left to top-right.
(see screenshot)
Expected Results:
Setting the same rotation on the horizontal and vertical axis should rotate the text the same way.
Workaround (if any):
if you want the text to "lean" the same way, set one rotation to a positive value and the other to a negative value
