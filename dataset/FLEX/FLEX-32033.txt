Summary:
CLONE -Null Object Error "at mx.controls.listClasses::AdvancedListBase/mouseMoveHandler()"
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1.Produce a ADG with a significant amount of data (I'm using selectionMode="multipleCells" ).
2.Create a filter that filters the ArrayCollection data bound to the dataProvider based on the value of a selected cell.
3.As the data is filtering, move the mouse around the data grid, where no data will be.
4.If you do this right the Error is thrown in the mouse event as the event tries to access a cell that no longer contains data.
I am able to reproduce this everytime, but it took me a while to get to where I can. I can post an example if needed.
I am unsure of my version. I am using the latest beta of Flex Builder 3 (3.0.190133) which I downloaded a few days ago.
Actual Results:
TypeError: Error #1009: Cannot access a property or method of a null object reference.
at mx.controls.listClasses::AdvancedListBase/mouseMoveHandler()[C:\Work\flex\dmv_automation\projects\datavisualisation\src\mx\controls\listClasses\AdvancedListBase.as:8068]
Expected Results:
No error.
Workaround (if any):
None yet. (Will probably rewrite the event handler)
