Summary:
WebService no longer explicitly returns 'getContactsReturn' which is the response name for getContactsResponse.
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run http://localhost:8400/qa-regress/testsuites/mxunit/tests/proxyService/202863/src/bug202863DocLit.mxml
2. Update source code changing each instance of 'getContactsReturn.length' to just '.length'
3. Run updated test.
Actual Results: getContactsReturn is never available in the result.
Expected Results: Test is unchanged in years so previously getContactsReturn must have been there. Test started failing just prior to 4/12/2011. The class mx.rpc.soap.WebService has not been updated recently.
Perhaps this is a regression of the original bug, 202863.
