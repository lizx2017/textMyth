Summary:
Flex QTP Automation doesnt record user actions on custom grid.
Description:
Notes with Issue:
It is basically a HTML application and the custom flex component is embedded wherever required.
Hierarchy of SuperGrid component:
SuperGrid extends UIComponent and has the following components in it
SuperGrid -> Text
SuperGrid -> Grid(DataGrid)
SuperGrid -> Grid -> ItemRenderer(Label, CheckBox)
SuperGrid -> Grid -> ItemEditor(TextInput, ComboBox)
All the events are dispatched to the html application in SuperGrid class.
All the components that are present in the SuperGrid(including itemRenderers) are been identified through Object Spy of QTP. This is been done by writing the delegate classes. But the record and play is not working for some of the components.
Problems facing to automate this component:
1. Record and Play of SuperGrid component. Not able to frame the class definition XML for all the components(including Text, Datagrid & itemRenderers) with a single event in SuperGrid class.
2. Selecting a row in DataGrid, change of item in ComboBox are not recorded in QTP.
3. Index / unique property is needed to identify the supergrid. The SuperGrid automationIndex increases according to the number of times it is created.
I attached all the files required for this. And I used version as Flex3 as Flex 2 is not available in combobox list. Actually we are facing problem with Flex 2. I really dont know whether this is a bug in Flex or issue that we are facing..
