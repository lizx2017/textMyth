Summary:
defaults.css from custom theme is no longer automatically sourced
Description:
When applying a theme to an application (through the `-theme` compiler option), one previously did not have to explicitly source the `defaults.css` file from the theme. The style sheet would be applied automatically.
This is no longer the case since v4.9.0; it still works as expected with v4.8.0 and earlier.
Workaround
explicitly source the css file in the main application:
<fx:Style source="defaults.css"/>
