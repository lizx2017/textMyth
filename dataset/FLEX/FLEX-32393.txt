Summary:
Inconsistent bhavior summarizng first column in AdvancedDataGrid
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Use AdvancedDataGrid with GroupingCollection
2. Group on 3 fields
3. Add summary 'SUM' or anything, for all 3 grouping level and specify a summary renderer for the FIRST column in the table (index 0)
4. Run the code
5. You can rerun to see the difference by adding an additional summary in the SECOND column
Actual Results:
Expand the tree one node at a time.
Notice that the summary is displayed only for the inner most grouping.
If you rerun - as step 5 indicates above, notice now that the summary is displayed for the 2nd column, but still not for the first.
Expected Results:
The summary should be displayed for all grouping levels.
Workaround (if any):
NONE - As I do not have the luxury of moving the column to a different positon.
