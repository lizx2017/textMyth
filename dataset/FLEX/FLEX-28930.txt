Summary:
FTETextField Crashes when using HTMLText
Description:
FTETextCrash1.mxml
Steps to reproduce:
1. Launch the application.
2. Click the button
Actual Results:
I get a "One of the parameters is invalid" error. This happens when I create an FTETextField with one line of htmlText, then I create some extra text fields. Then when I update the initial text field to multiline htmlText(this happens when you click the button), the crash occurs.
Expected Results:
No crash.
Workaround (if any):
Don't use htmlText?
FTETextCrash2.mxml
Steps to reproduce:
1. Launch the application.
2. Resize the application. You will see the htmlText "flash" and after enough resizing the application will crash due to an infinite loop.
Actual Results:
"Flashing text" and eventually a crash will occur.
Expected Results:
No crash and no flashing text.
Workaround (if any):
Don't use htmlText?
These are some additional findings after my initial bug report: https://bugs.adobe.com/jira/browse/SDK-31793
It would be great to have a response from Adobe about these issues. It seems that we are having a myriad of issues with htmlText since we updated to 4.5.1 from 4.0
