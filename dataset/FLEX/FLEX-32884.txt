Summary:
Legends for Charts do not show properly when using FTE for MX components
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a simple pie chart in a new application
2. Add a legend for the pie chart
3. Go into the compiler settings for the project and enable, "Use Flash Text Engine in MX components"
Actual Results:
The legend text values will sporadically show values. If you reload the attached application different legend label values will be shown/hidden each time you load it. Also if you mouse over the pie chart some legend text values will disappear.
Expected Results:
The legend text values should always show
Workaround (if any):
With FTE still enabled in the compiler settings, in your CSS you can set the following for the LegendItem:
textFieldClass: ClassReference("mx.core.UITextField");
This will make the legenditem utilize the old TextRenderer and not have the issues described above, though you have to embed your font twice (because of CFF) and international characters do not show at all.
