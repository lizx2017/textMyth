Summary:
DataGrid with locked columns throws exception if dataProvider filter function shrinks values
Description:
A Spark DataGrid with locked column will throw an "Index out of bounds" exception if the ArrayCollection dataProvider's filter function reduces the number of elements displayed.
The DataGrid correctly handles the change of source data if there are no locked columns, or if the dataProvider itself is changed to the new collection.
