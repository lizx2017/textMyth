Summary:
Can configure to have multiple series on single axis on one side of a chart (left axis). Configure it to the right side of the same chart, it renderes as multiple axis
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
See screenshots for each step
1. Create a chart that renderes multiple series with common data type on LEFT axis (single axis) - this gets rendered correctly
2. Create a chart that renderes multiple series with common data tyoe on RIGHT axis (single axis) - this gets rendered correctly
3. Create a chart configuring both Left and Right axis as given above on the same chart - On this the right axis gets rendered as multiple axis. Left axis renderes correctly
Actual Results:
Left x-axis renders differently to the right x-axis
Expected Results:
emulate the same behaviour (to have multiple series on single axis) on any axis on any side.
Workaround (if any):
none in order to get it to work as given above
