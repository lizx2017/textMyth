Summary:
Tree Error in updateDropData
Description:
When dragging and dropping, a
"Type Error #1010 A term is undefined and has no properties" 
occurs sometimes when dragging over multiple rows.
It may only happen with the NativeDragManager or may not. I haven't pinned it down. I've attached screen shots.
It happens on Line 2782 in mx.controls.Tree:
var topItem:Object = (rowNum > _verticalScrollPosition && rowNum <= numItems) ? 
              listItems[rowNum - _verticalScrollPosition - 1][0].data : null;
The item at this index contains no items (see screenshot):
listItems[rowNum - _verticalScrollPosition - 1]
The solution may be to check if the array has a length:
if ((rowNum > _verticalScrollPosition && rowNum <= numItems) && 
        listItems[rowNum - _verticalScrollPosition - 1].length ) {
    var topItem:Object = listItems[rowNum - _verticalScrollPosition - 1][0].data;
}
but that may only prevent the error and not be the root of the problem.
Note: It looks like the next line doesn't test if the array has data either:
var bottomItem:Object = (rowNum - verticalScrollPosition < rowInfo.length && rowNum < numItems) ? 
              listItems[rowNum - _verticalScrollPosition][0].data  : null;
