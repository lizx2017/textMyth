Summary:
Spark List's selectedIndices Vector.<int> reorders itself
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a Spark List with three items and multiple selection enabled
2. Select the first item, then the second, then the third
3. Trace out the selected indices
Actual Results:
Indices come out reordered, in my current test I get 2, 0, 1.
Expected Results:
Expecting 0, 1, 2 (or possibly 2, 1, 0). If the order in which the items are selected is important, it is no longer possible to use the selectedIndices vector to keep track of this. Previously when selectedIndices was an Array, the order of selection was maintained.
Workaround (if any):
Need to maintain a second list of selected items
