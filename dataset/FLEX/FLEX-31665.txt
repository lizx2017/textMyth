Summary:
MouseEvent.target for click events is not consistent between AdvancedDataGridGroupItemRender and AdvancedDataGridItemRenderer
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Simply added a click or doubeClick handler to an AdvancedDataGrid with at least one AdvancedDataGridGroupItemRenderer. For example, I added the following attribute to the AdvancedDataGrid in the "dpcontrols/adg/SimpleHierarchicalADGXML.mxml" example:
click="Alert.show(event.target.toString())"
(I've attached the modified example).
Actual Results:
For click events on the non-Group items, the event.target is of type "AdvancedDataGridItemRenderer" as expected. However, the same click events for the Group items, get the event.target as the "UITextField" within the AdvancedDataGridGroupItemRenderer.
Expected Results:
I would expect that event.target should always be one of AdvancedDataGridItemRenderer or AdvancedDataGridGroupItemRenderer - never UITextField (assuming no custom item renderer is being used of course).
Workaround (if any):
In the event handler, you can do something like this:
var eventTarget:Object = event.target;
if (eventTarget.parent && eventTarget.parent is AdvancedDataGridGroupItemRenderer)
eventTarget = eventTarget.parent;
This inconsistency is present in both M2 (Beta 1) and M3 build 181724.
