Summary:
Throws an RTE when lockedColumnCount=x is set on ADG having dataprovider, data returned by a HTTPService which takes a bit of time. Works fine for lockedRowCount though. Does not throw RTE for DataGrid.
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Use <mx:ADG with dataprovider=
{A result from HTTP Service}
having lockedColumnCount=2 (say).
or
1. Use the file ArunApplication_DG.mxml to see that <mx:DataGrid> works fine without any RTE
2. Use the file ArunApplication.mxml to see that it throws RTE
Actual Results: throws an RTE
Expected Results: should not throw an RTE. It works fine for DataGrid.. DataGrid actually waits for the entire data to be filled into it and then applies lockedColumnCount on it. This works when lockedRowCount=2(say) is set on the ADG.
