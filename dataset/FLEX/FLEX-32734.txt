Summary:
styleFunction gets NaN for valid (but formatted) values
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Add itemRendererProviders to the OLAP Data Grid, and have them use either a CurrencyFormatter, or use dot as thousandsSeparator.
2. Add a styleFunction that depends on the value (for example: negative as red, or higher than 1000 as green, as in Developer's Guide)
Actual Results:
Your style function will receive a NaN for many cells that have valid values.
This happens because on OLAPDataGrid::applyUserStylesForItemRenderer, the formatted value is converted to number:
"var label:String = listData.label;
var cellValue:Number = Number(label);"
Number(label) will return NaN for labels with multiple dots (and it's perfectly fine) or currency symbols.
Expected Results:
The style function should receive the original value, prior to formatters work. At least, it should receive the formatted String, instead of a NaN.
Workaround (if any):
Couldn't find any (just removed this feature for now). As the method receives both axis, I might be able to look up the original value, but I'm afraid it will turn a feature that should be cheap in a very expensive one.
