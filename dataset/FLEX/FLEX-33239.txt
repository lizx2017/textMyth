Summary:
Repeatedly forced to reset my password for SVN and id.apache.org
Description:
I am finding that I consistently have to reset my password when weeks have elapsed since my last commit. At first I thought I was just having trouble remembering the password, but I've confirmed that is not the issue. When the commit fails I get:
svn: E170001: Commit failed (details follow):
svn: E170001: POST of '/repos/asf/!svn/me': authorization failed: Could not authenticate to server: rejected Basic challenge (https://svn.apache.org)
I then go to id.apache.org, do a "forgot your password", follow the link sent to my email, reset my password to what I thought it was originally, then successfully commit. When I subsequently return to do a commit (sometimes days or weeks later) I must repeat the process.
When this problem occurs I can still SSH to people.apache.org successfully.
