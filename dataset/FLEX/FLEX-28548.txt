Summary:
When SplitViewNavigator has no size and set to HorizontalLayout, callout content is longer than callout
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Add SplitViewNavigator and three ViewNavigators. Do not set width/height on them.
2. Add Views with contents in different sizes.
3. Run the app. Open the callout with the first view navigator.
Actual Results: Callout content is longer than the callout.
With the same test file, the issue only occurs when SplitViewNavigator has HorizontalLayout.
Expected Results: Callout is sized to fit its content. This is an edge case but I'd like to see a fix since this is part of my mustella test.
