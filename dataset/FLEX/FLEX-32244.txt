Summary:
I am having AD with more than 50 columns created at runtime. I am adding records at runtime to the ADG... As my records increases, horizontal scrolling in ADG becomes slower and slower. This creates a performance issue in the ADG..
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Adding more than 40 columns to the Advanceddatagrid at runtime using action script.
2. Adding more than 15 records in the advanceddatagrid and continue adding more n more records
Actual Results:
Scrolling to the advanceddatagrid will be very much slower. taking more than 3 seconds for one scroll
Expected Results:
It should scroll within 0.5 seconds
Workaround (if any):
-> We can add scrollbar to the container of advanceddatagrid (i.e. HBox, VBox or Canvas) but it will not give steady look to the grid header, grid footer and lockedcolumns.
