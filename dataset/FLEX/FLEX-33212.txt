Summary:
fcsh with include-inheritance-dependencies-only creates empty swc (when compc works as expected)
Description:
Following config fails to compile with fcsh (symptoms are similar to FLEX-23990 - swc has no classes exept library.swf document class) but compiles perfectly with compc using the same configuration http://pastie.org/4892492
I just downloaded apache-flex-sdk-4.8.0-incubating-bin.tar.gz to make sure it happens with apache version (it does; I had to use flexconfig.xml from adobe sdk because I was getting "unable to open '
{playerglobalHome}
/10.1/playerglobal.swc'" but the binaries were from 4.8.0 build 1359417)
