Summary:
QTP Plugin for Flex does not work with Prototype.js and Jason.js files
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Install QTP 9.5 and Flex plugin
2. Open QTP with Flex plugin enabled and the web application with Flex application embedded in it.
3. Record the steps operated on the Flex application.
Actual Results: QTP does not generate any script
Expected Results: QTP should generate script for each step operated on the Flex application
Workaround (if any): Remove the Jason.js and prototype.js files from the wrapper file. But this is not an option for us since we are using the prototype.js and json.js in our web application.
The js files are availble at the following links:
Json.js - http://www.json.org/
Prototype.js - http://www.prototypejs.org/
