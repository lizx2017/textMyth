Summary:
CLONE -Grid Contents shift to right when scrolling in AdvancedDataGrid
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Load an AdvancedDataGrid (ADG) with a HierarchicalData DataProvider from an XML document.
2. Expand All nodes in the ADG using the expandAll() method.
3. Scroll the ADG by grabbing the ADG scroll bar and pulling it down quickly.
Actual Results:
1. Grid contents in all of the columns - other than the navigation column - are shifted to the right.
2. All Column Headers shift slightly to the right, apparently filling the space to the right of the last Header (the space above the scrollbar).
See attached screen shots:

For example of column header shifting:

after: adg_grid_shift_04.gif (notice the location of the sort arrow)
Expected Results:
Smooth scrolling, no shifting of grid contents.
