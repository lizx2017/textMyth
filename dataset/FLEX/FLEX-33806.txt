Summary:
spark AlertSkin contentGroup paddingTop missing
Description:
Show an Alert with a multiline message (with a \n for example).
The text control will be without top padding under the titleGroup.
(with a single line message this is not visible because the textField is vertically centered and the Alert has a minHeight - so the padding "seems" to be there)
Workaround: Create a new Alert skin based on the original and add paddingTop=5 to the container layout which holds the RichText control
