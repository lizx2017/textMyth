Summary:
Unable to access jarfile error because /js/bin/mxmlc.bat refers to incorrect \js\lib\mxmlc.jar
Description:
Context:
When starting the project using FalconJX external tool on Windows, the mxmlc.jar cannot be found.
Expected result:
When running the project using FalconJX external tool, the project is compiled properly into a FlexJS output.
Actual result::
The FalconJX external tool outputs the following error message:
Error: Unable to access jarfile C:\Apps\FlexJS-0.5.0\js\lib\mxmlc.jar
Test-case:
1. create a Flex project application proposed in https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLEX/Using+FlexJS+with+Adobe+Flash+Builder
2. select the project application MXML file
3. Select Run menu > External tools > FalconJX => errors occurs.
Diagnostic:
The /js/bin/mxmlc.bat used on Windows contains the following java command-line option:
{{ -jar "%FALCON_HOME%\js\lib\mxmlc.jar" }}
Note that FALCON_HOME has been defined as "C:\Apps\FlexJS-0.5.0" (it contains the installer.xml).
However, the mxmlc.jar file is in the "C:\Apps\FlexJS-0.5.0\lib" directory.
Is the jar file in the correct directory or is the path in the command file incorrect? (note that I did not check the linux command file).
