Summary:
framework/build_framework.xml has not been kept up-to-date with new swcs and bundles
Description:
build_framework.xml is renamed to build.xml in the binary kit
Traditionally this file has been there to allow the swcs to be built for debugging
Either this file should go away and be removed from the kit or it should be kept up-to-date.
If kept, I see that apache.swc and the bundles for apache and experimental are missing. The file should be reviewed in total to see if anything else is missing and the build commands are still correct.
