Summary:
Chart Labels do not stay within the boundaries of the parent container
Description:
Please find attached the screenshot.
I have a HDivided box. In the left section of the HDivided, I have a Canvas in which I have added a chart. The labels of the chart not only spill outside the boundaries of the parent container (which is the canvas) but they also spill outside the HDivided box.
Please refer to the screenshot.
