Summary:
FlashPlayer Freeze using Scroller in Skin
Description:
Doing this simple Test results in strange Flash/Flex behavior. No exception rises, ends up with a script timeout :
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<s:Application xmlns:fx="http://ns.adobe.com/mxml/2009"
xmlns:s="library://ns.adobe.com/flex/spark"
xmlns:mx="library://ns.adobe.com/flex/mx">
<s:SkinnableContainer width="100%" height="200" skinClass="scrollableskin">
<s:Button label="test" right="-1" id="btn"/>
<s:HGroup width="100%" height="100%">
<s:Label text="blubber"/>
</s:HGroup>
</s:SkinnableContainer>
</s:Application>
In the real application the Button has its own skin and is put to "right -1" because of design (vertical line flow with surrounding border)
The skin class for the SkinnableContainer is only extended with a Scroller - the rest is generated FB Code:
....
<s:Scroller width="100%" height="100%">
<s:Group id="contentGroup" left="0" right="0" top="0" bottom="0" minWidth="0" minHeight="0">
<s:layout>
<s:BasicLayout/>
</s:layout>
</s:Group>
</s:Scroller>
...
After putting the "Right" Value of the Button to 0 everything works fine.
