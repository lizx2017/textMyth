Summary:
const class member variables get initialized incorrectly
Description:
const class members should be initialized the same way that var members get initialized. As it is now, const member variables are initialized as if they were static.
Example code:
public class TestClass
{
 public function TestClass(value:String)
 {
  myConst.prop = value;
  myVar.prop = value;
 }
 public const myConst:Object = {};
 public var myVar:Object = {};
}
Incorrectly cross-compiled:
TestClass = function(value) {
  
  this.myVar = {};
  this.myConst.prop = value;
  this.myVar.prop = value;
};
TestClass.prototype.myConst = {};
TestClass.prototype.myVar;
Expected correct result:
TestClass = function(value) {
  this.myConst = {};
  this.myVar = {};
  this.myConst.prop = value;
  this.myVar.prop = value;
};
TestClass.prototype.myConst;
TestClass.prototype.myVar;
