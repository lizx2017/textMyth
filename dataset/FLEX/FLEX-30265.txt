Summary:
QTP versions 9.5 and 10 does not work with Flex 3.0.2 applications (QTP 9.2 works fine)
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
Environment 1 - QTP 9.5 + IE7 + FlexBuilder 3.0.2 + many windows platforms
Environment 2 - QTP 10 + IE 8 + FlexBuilder 3.0.2 + Windows7
1. Compile Flex application with Adobe provided libraries automation.swc, automation_agent.swc, qtp.swc, automation_dmv.swc
2. Install the Adobe FlexBuilder 3.0.2 provided QTP plugin as per instructions
3. After restart open QTP and select Flex 3.00 option on QTP
4. Start recording.
Actual Results:
On both environments, running the same Flex application,
Nothing gets recorded. Object spy cannot identify Flex objects. Whole Flex page gets added as a single MacromediaFlashPlayerActiveX of class WinObject.
However the same application works fine with QTP 9.2 + IE7/IE8 on almost all of the Windows platforms
Expected Results:
QTP 9.5 and QTP 10 should identify Flex as it has advertised.
Workaround (if any):
None. Been trying since 2008.
Would not have bought QTP if not for version 9.2 which works for Flex.
