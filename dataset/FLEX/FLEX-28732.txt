Summary:
Stage focus isn't restored after an android device is reactivated after being suspended
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run the attached fxp on device
2. Press the "New View" button
3. Lock the device by pressing the power button (using an Atrix)
4. Unlock the device
5. Press the back key
Actual Results:
The view animates back to the previous view. The current view is attempting to cancel the back key by catching the keyDown event and preventing default on it. Since the focus isn't restored to the navigator, the event isn't caught and the application navigates back.
Expected Results:
When the back key is pressed, the view should remain visible
Workaround (if any):
Listen for the activate event on the NativeApplication an manually set the focus
