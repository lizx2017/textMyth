Summary:
trace() statements called in child Flex apps not executed
Description:
When I try to call a trace() statement in a Flex app that is loaded into a parent Flex app, the trace() statement is not executed.
However, when the child SWF is created in Flash, the trace() statement executes as expected.
This is a major disruption to my debugging process.
