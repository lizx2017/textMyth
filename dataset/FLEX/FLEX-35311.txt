Summary:
Apache Flex Installer Fails to Launch on OS X 10.12 Sierra
Description:
Launching of the Apache Flex Installer fails when clicking on the icon in Finder. The application attempts to launch then silently fails. However you can launch the application from the command prompt, at which point the launcher patches itself to the 64bit version and then runs correctly there after:

The issue appears to be with a 32bit OS X flex launcher being included. Again, once the launcher is updated, see above -> copying new 64bit launcher from /Library/Frameworks/Adobe.... , everything works correctly from then on.
Recommend updating the AIr version used to build the application to a more modern version with a 64bit launcher.
