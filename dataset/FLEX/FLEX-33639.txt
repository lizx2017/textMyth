Summary:
Falcon compiles cleanly, but resulting SWF displays no output.
Description:
If I have correctly followed the nightly Jenkins output for tests of the Falcon Compiler what is primarily being tested and reported is the successful unit test suite. I had begun testing against some of my own, trivial test programs, but then discovered that you already have a better set of files available. That solves all the problems of my having to send my code, my test environment, etc. I'm testing using your source files.
So, after confirming that basicTests\spark]views\HelloWorld.mxml compiles and seems to produce the correct on stage output when run through the stand-alone debugger, I next grabbed your nice low-level test for a DataGrid at basicTests\spark\views\DataGridTests.mxml.
I don't know if your new compiler has taken some of the features of the fcsh wrapper from the old compiler or not, but at least superficially, it seems like a second compilation is much faster than a first one. HelloWorld waddled around for 14 seconds, but DataGrid reported back, thusly in about 5 seconds:
==========
D:\FlexSDK\ABlackboard\falconTB>D:\FlexSDK\ABlackboard\falconsdk\bin\mxmlc DataGridTests.mxml
Using Falcon codebase: D:\\FlexSDK\\ABlackboard
falconsdk
Using Flex SDK: D:\\FlexSDK\\ABlackboard
falconsdk
Loading configuration: D:\FlexSDK\ABlackboard\falconsdk\frameworks\flex-config.xml
518865 bytes written to D:\FlexSDK\ABlackboard\falconTB\DataGridTests.swf in 6.177 seconds
D:\FlexSDK\ABlackboard\falconTB>
==========
So, while that's the good news, the bad news is if I run that half-megabye swf file, the screen comes up completely empty.
BTW I am sorry to have clicked the Component Drop Down for the old compiler, but I could not find anything that seemed correct for keeping track of Falcon for Flex or Falcon for AIR. Whomever owns JIRA ought to be able to fix that.
