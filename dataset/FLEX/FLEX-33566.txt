Summary:
Application takes more time in loading while it is launched first time
Description:
My application takes lots of time downloading Apache flex sdk 4.9 swf files while it is loaded first time.
Earlier I was using Flex sdk 4.0 but due to changes in flash player 11 I was forced to shift to sdk 4.9.
In SDK 4.0 there were .swz files which were taking less time in loading my application.
But in SDK 4.9 there is no .swf files. So it is taking more time in downloading .swf files.
So please help me in finding some solution for this so that my application loaded as fast as it was happening earlier.
Thanks
