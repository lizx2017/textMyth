Summary:
PieChart with labelPosition set to inside and only one record for the ArrayCollection causes label not to display.
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1) Run test case.
Actual Results:
Label is not displayed inside the pie chart.
Expected Results:
Label should be displayed.
Workaround (if any):
Within PieSeries.as find the measureInternalLabels(bCallout:Boolean,renderCache:Array):Object function.
Find the following code and add the line where I have my comment below.
if (rscale * Number(labelFormat.size) < insideLabelSizeLimit)
{ visibleLabels.push(ld); // kmossman - Add the visibleLabels here, this is the bug fix. Once added you'll then see the label correctly. ld.prev.next = ld.next; ld.next.prev = ld.prev; removedLabels.push(ld); sortedLabels.splice(i,1); continue; }
else
{ visibleLabels.push(ld); labelScale = Math.min(labelScale,rscale); }
This resolves the problem, this also exists in Flex 2.0.1 HotFix 3 please back fix if possible.
