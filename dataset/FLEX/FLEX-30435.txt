Summary:
mx.control.Menu is not exposed to Flex Automation hierarchy when opened from a secondary AIR window
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
Attached project contains 2 identical AIR appications. The only difference is that "DataGridNoWin" application is a single-windowed app and "WindowedDataGrid" app shows its content in a secondary AIR window.
The application content consist of an AdvancedDataGrid and a Menu that is shown on rightClick event.
When this content is in the primary AIR window (see DataGridNoWin app) everything works as expected. The menu is exposed to Flex automation hierarchy. See trace() messages in the showMenu() function. They correctly show that before menu openening the window has just 1 child and after menu showing there are 2 children. Debugging confirms that the second child is the menu (as expected).
However when exact same content and code is run in the secondary AIR window (see WindowedDataGrid app) it does not work as expected. The menu is shown however it is not exposed to Flex automation hierarchy. This is evidenced by trace() messages showing that both before and after menu opening the child count of the window is exactly 1.
Actual Results:
Menu shown in secondary AIR window is not exposed to Flex Automation hierarchy.
Expected Results:
Menu shown in secondary AIR window is exposed to Flex Automation hierarchy.
