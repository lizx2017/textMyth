Summary:
Deleting an item in the source collection does not cause removal in the GroupingCollection
Description:
Reproduction:
1. Launch bug file
2. select an item and then press the delete button
Actual Results:
DG does not update (collection isn't updated either)
Expected Results:
DG refreshes and item is missing
Workaround:
hit refresh button and you'll see it updates
the bug is probably in GroupingCollection.removeSummaries. Line 943 has a check to see if there is a summary map for the parent, but my GC doesn't have summaries so I don't think this passes. The if statement probably needs to be just for IList and then the summaryMap check needs to be later on within this if statement.
