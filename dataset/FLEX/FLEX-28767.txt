Summary:
The label in the tool tip doesn't inherit the locale of the target component
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Copy the attached zip or fxp file.
2. Run the app Testing.mxml.
3. Mouse over the TextArea, TextInput and then the Button and look at the text in the tooltip.
Actual Results:
For TextArea(default), it shows the default locale for both the target component(TextArea) and the tooltip, i.e. en.
For TextInput(setting locale via type selector), it shows the locale for the target component(TextInput) is ja-JP and the locale for the tooltip is en.
For Button(setting locale via class selector), it shows the locale for the target component(Button) is ja-JP and the locale for the tooltip is en.
Expected Results: According to Max's command in the testplan, "the label in the tool tip inherits the locale of the target component". So in this case, I think it should show ja-JP for both the target component and tooltip for TextInput and Button.
