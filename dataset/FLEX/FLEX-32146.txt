Summary:
Series invalidateMapping function
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
If you extend the series classes and wish to produce you're own mapping, you should be able to call invalidateMapping(false) to set the mapping cache to valid. However, this does work with invalidateData(false), and other similar chart caches.
The problem is a bug in the code for invalidateMapping in the seriesObject.
protected function invalidateMapping(invalid:Boolean = true):void
{
if (invalid)
{ _bDataDirty = true; // for transitions to work, we need a new cache _bMappingDirty = true; _bFilterDirty = true; _bTransformDirty = true; invalidateTransitions(); invalidateDisplayList(); }
else
{ _bMappingDirty = true; // **BUG** SHOULD BE _bMappingDirty = false; }
}
If the variables were marked as protected, rather than private, this wouldn't be an issue. But, because everything is marked as private, there is no other way to get access to the variables, thus it makes extending the series somewhat difficult.
ADOBE: PLEASE do a search/replace for private to protected on ALL classes. It really cripples FLEX to not be able to extend the components easily.
