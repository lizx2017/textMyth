Summary:
Compile-time approach is not working for flex application (where multiple mxml files are embedded in single mxml) for automation using QTP
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1.Performed appliation mxml compilation with automation libraries using ant target.
2.Installed QTP plugin on the client machine and accesed the appliation URL from the client machine.
3.Observed that FLEX objects are not getting identified by using QTP.
Actual Results:
FLEX objects are not getting identified by using QTP
Expected Results:
Flex Objects should identify by using QTP plugin.
Note : Noticed that, QTP is able to identify the compiled application , where single mxml file is used. For example, app1.mxml and app2.mxml, which are not embedded into one. Compiled app1.mxml and app2.mxml files using ant-target, which is worked for QTP.
