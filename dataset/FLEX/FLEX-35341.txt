Summary:
Compiler errors for invalid css
Description:
The is room for improvement in the errors that the compiler reports when trying to compile invalid CSS.
For example:
.foo{
 8px 24px 0px;
}
This correctly causes a compiler error, but the error message is somewhat cryptic:
/Users/harbs/Documents/ApacheFlex/flex-falcon/compiler/src/main/antlr3/org/apache/flex/compiler/internal/css/CSSTree.g: node from after line 13:3 mismatched tree node: <mismatched token: [@111,219:221='8px',<52>,14:3], resync={
   8px 24px 0px;
  }> expecting I_DECL

It shows the correct offending content, but the message is not very clear. Additionally, the line number where the error occurs is wrong.
