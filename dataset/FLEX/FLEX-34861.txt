Summary:
Date dst not considered with seconds/milliseconds
Description:
Settings seconds and milliseconds on date during the dst change wrongly the timezone.
For instance by executing the following code snippet across dst (Europe/Rome timezone):
var date:Date = new Date();
trace(date);    
date.seconds = 0;
trace(date); 
it prints out:
Sun Oct 25 02:17:22 GMT+0200 2015
Sun Oct 25 02:17:00 GMT+0100 2015
The same happens for milliseconds.
