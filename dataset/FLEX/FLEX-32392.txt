Summary:
Wrong japanese translation for word high, low, open, close used by DataTip of CandlestickChart
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
Mouseover to any candlestick in CandlestickChart.
wrong translation of the "high", "low", "open" "close" text will be displayed in DataTip .

open=「開く」
close=「閉じる」
high=「高」
low=「低」
