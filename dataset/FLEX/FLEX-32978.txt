Summary:
Gaps between the bar segments in stacked bar charts
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
There must be some sort of numerical round-off bug that is causing there to be small gaps between some of the bar segments in the stacked bar charts.
The gaps between the bar charts are pronounced when the border thickness is increased and the browser window is re-sized.Problem occurring in Firefox 4.0.1 and Internet Explorer 8.0 . We can reduce it by making the border thinner.
Included is a sample application:
Three different configurations used in the Sample Application
Border thickness 1
Border thickness 0.1
No border
