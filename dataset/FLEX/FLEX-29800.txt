Summary:
FlexEvent.Button_Down event is not listened to in ButtonAutomationImpl delegate - needed to support Buttons with AutoRepeat
Description:
FlexEvent.ButtonDown is the event that is fired when the KeyDown message is received for the Space Key or when the LButtonDown message is received for the mouse. Additionally, the ButtonDown event is fired for an AutoRepeat button on each configured interval following the configured initial delay. It appears to be the only way to reliable record and playback an AutoRepeat button.
The FlexEvent.ButtonDown event is not listened for in the ButtonAutomationImpl delegate. For most cases this is fine as it would be a redundant message. When the button is an AutoRepeat button, however, there seems to be no other way to determine how many repeats have occured as only FlexEvent.Button_Down events are posted. Only the Click or Type event is recorded.
Workaround (if any):
Derive a new delegate from ButtonAutomationImpl that adds the event listener for FlexEvent.BUTTON_DOWN. This is not really a safe workaround due to the fact that anyone else can do the same thing to me.
