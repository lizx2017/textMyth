Summary:
AdvancedDataGrid does not redraw when filterFunction is applied
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Setup an AdvancedDataGrid with a datasource.
2. Apply filterFunction to the datasource.
(See attached file for example)
Actual Results:
The results of the filter should appear in the ADG.
Expected Results:
The grid does not reflect the filter until you force a redraw by, for example, clicking on the grid's column header.
Workaround (if any):
Add an event listener to the datasource and when that datasource changes, force a refresh().
(See attached file for example)
PS - I'm using the final version of Flex Builder 3 Pro; I couldn't find this entry in "Found in Version" field.
