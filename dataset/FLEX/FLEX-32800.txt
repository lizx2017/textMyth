Summary:
DataTip padding too high when direction is LTR
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
When you change the alignment of the datatips to RTL, the default padding appears to be increased. See attached image and run attached application after removing the negative setting for paddingRight. The distance between the edge of the data tip and the start of the words is much greater than when the direction is LTR.
Actual Results:
Expected Results:
Datatip text should have the same "padding" whether RTL or LTR.
Workaround (if any):
You can adjust it to a more normal appearance by setting paddingRight to a negative number.
