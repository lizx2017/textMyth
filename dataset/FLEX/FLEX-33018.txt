Summary:
Flex AdvancedDataGrid, one additional unwanted row(with no data) is coming at the end. We tried with data provider items count, number of rows giving exact height to the table, still not able to remove row. This occurs when vertical scrollbar is there.
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Add columns dynamically to grouped column and then grouped columns to be added to ADG.
2. Give data to the ADG data provider, ADG height also dynamically such that you get vertical scrollbar.
3. Scroll down you will be able to see the single extra row without data as last row of the ADG.
Actual Results: blank/empty row at the last for dymanic ADG
Expected Results: Without blank/empty row at the last for dymanic ADG
Workaround (if any): Fine when there is no vertical scrollbar, currently given last row height as 1 px, but only works at few places not all.
