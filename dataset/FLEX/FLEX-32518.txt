Summary:
Specifying horizontalAxis or verticalAxis on LineSeries with itemRenderer and SeriesInterpolate
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a LineChart with a LineSeries
2. Explicitely define the horizontalAxis and verticalAxis on the chart
3. Set the horizontalAxis and verticalAxis property on the LineSeries to point to those defined in Step 2
4. Create a SeriesInterpolate effect and set it as the showDataEffect on the LineSeries
5. Use mx.charts.renderers.CircleItemRenderer as the itemRenderer on the LineSeries
Actual Results:
When the dataProvider of the LineChart changes, the effect is triggered and the line moves. The dots (from the itemRenderer) do not move to their new locations.
Expected Results:
The dots (from the itemRenderer) should move to their new locations once the effect is complete.
Workaround (if any):
Do not specify the horizontalAxis or verticalAxis property on the LineSeries.
*Please view the attached sample application to see an example of a LineChart displaying this issue and one without it.
