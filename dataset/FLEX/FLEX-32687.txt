Summary:
SQLColumnSchema sets dataType = null when retrieving ViewSchema information
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Call connection.loadSchema(SQLViewSchema, viewName, "main", true)
2. Get results with SQLViewSchema(connection.getSchemaResult().views[0]).columns
Actual Results:
Although the view's columns are returned, for each one of them, the property dataType is null.
Expected Results:
dataType should contain the column's dataType (i.e. CHAR(5), NUMBER, etc.)
Workaround (if any):
No workaround found.
This information was needed for a dynamic AdvancedDataGrid that creates it's columns (which are all custom types inherited from AdvancedDataGridColumn) based on the column data type.
The dataType is OK when retrieving table information instead of view information.
This is an AIR issue!
