Summary:
Menu Button long press resizes the stage inconsistently
Description:
The runtime has two different behaviors on a long press of the menu button. When no StageText is in focus, and the menu button is long pressed, the stage will always resize to half the screen height. (It doesn't resize when the auto correction bar shows or hides). When there is a StageText in focus and the menu button is long pressed, the stage does not resize.
The Application.resizeForSoftKeyboard property controls whether the application resizes when the softKeyboard is active.
The combination of these two factors create four permutations on a menu long press:
A) resizeForSoftKeyboard = false, no StageText focus (Bug)
Steps:
1) Long Press on menu button
Result:
Application resizes
Expected:
Application doesn't resize
B) resizeForSoftKeyboard = false, StageText focus
No bug. Behaves as expected
C) resizeForSoftKeyboard = true, no StageText focus
Changes to SoftKeyboard height (due to auto correction bar) don't change the application height
D) resizeForSoftKeyboard = true, StageText focus (Bug)
Steps:
1) Press in bottom TextInput, opening SoftKeyboard
2) Press "Done" on SoftKeyboard, closing SoftKeyboard
3) Long press on menu button
Result:
Application doesn't resize
Expected:
Application resizes
Run on Nexus One S, AIR Build 479
