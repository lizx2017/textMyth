Summary:
QTP does not recognize Flex objects
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Install QTP v10 and run Flex 4 add-in batch file
2. Launch QTP with Web, Flex 4.0.0 and Active X plug-ins
3. Record script against Flex Store sample
Actual Results:
Flex application objects not recognized. Each mouse click records Browser("Flex Store").Page("Flex Store").WinObject(MacromediaActiveX
Expected Results:
QTP would record flex objects from the Flex Store sample rather than finding only the WinObject.
Workaround (if any):
None, I suspect it's a setup issue, but I haven't been able to find the right combination of things in all of the forums and problem tickets here. I have been working with this for over week with no luck. I have full admin rights so that's not the issue. I am also experiencing problems with QTP v11 with Flex 3. Nothing is recorded with this setup. I cannot get Flex 4 to load with the machine I have QTP v11 installed on, so I'm trying to get at least one of them to work.
