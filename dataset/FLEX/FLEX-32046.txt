Summary:
Few Aggregator (count, average) dont work propery when cube is built with only one attribute
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
var olapMeasure: OLAPMeasure = new OLAPMeasure('@'+olapDimension.name, olapDimension.displayName);
alapMeasure.aggregator = new CountAggregator(); or olapMeasure.aggregator = new AverageAggregator().
AverageAggregator.as
public function computeBegin(dataField:String):Object
{
//to start initialize the sum and count fields to zero.
var newObj:Object = {};
newObj[dataField] = 0;
newObj[dataField + "Count"] = 0;
return newObj;
}
CodeNodeBuilder.as
for (prop in value)
{
measure = measureMap[prop];
aggregator = measure.aggregator as IOLAPCustomAggregator;
if (temp.hasOwnProperty(prop))
{ aggregator.computeObjectLoop(temp[prop], value[prop]); }
else
{ temp[prop] = aggregator.computeObjectBegin(value[prop]); computeObjEndMap[measure].push(temp); }
}
TypeError: Error #1009: Cannot access a property or method of a null object reference.
Sample with datfield = 'YEAR', not find measure with name "@YEARCount"
attribute "object" is :
@YEAR
@YEARCount = 2

Add a dummy attribute as shown in updated bug file
