Summary:
OLAPAttribute never really refresh its members
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Download and run the attached text.mxml application;
2. Click on button 1, button 2 and button 3;
3. Examine the results.
Actual Results:
Button 1 and Button 2 do the same thing: create an arraycollection of 20 records and set it as the source data of the cube, then rebuild and query on it - but the time taken by the creation of the axis (that is, reading the members of the two attributes and performing a crossJoin/hierarchize on the result OLAPSet) is very different, 0,2 seconds vs 10 seconds.
The problem is caused by OLAPAttribute: it never reset its unique members list, even changing the cube's dataProvider and refreshing it, this way a cube "weight" will always grow. Moreover, the variables holding these values (uniqueMembers and uniqueChildrenMap) are declared private, so it isn't possible to change this behavior with a subclass.
Expected Results:
IMO, the refresh the cube should also clear the unique members list of its dimension's attributes and rebuild it, unless a reason does exist to remember all the previous values.
Workaround (if any):
Can't find one! Any idea?
