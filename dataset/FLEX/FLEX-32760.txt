Summary:
ColumnChart: column width not correct when toggling between 100% type and clustered type
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create Column chart with at least 2 data series.
2. Create button that toggles "type" between 100% and clustered
Actual Results:
When toggling from clustered to 100%, column width remains same width as single series column in clustered view.
Expected Results:
Column width in 100% view should display "full width" (i.e. as per columnWidthRatio)
BarCharts do not display this problem. See example link below.
This worked OK in SDK 3.1
See example: http://www.lacscentre.com/flex_examples/colchartbug/
Workaround (if any):
None that I can find.
