Summary:
Using Path inside SparkSkin results in component creation failure
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
Just run or debug attached project, there are only one spark button with it's skin class and application_creationCompleteHandler (should show alert when created)
Actual Results:
FlexEvent.CREATION_COMPLETE is never dispatched, so we don't see the Alert.
Expected Results:
Handler gets executed and Alert is shown.
Workaround (if any):
Don't use the following code inside s:SparkSkin with hostComponent s:Button:
<s:Path id="innerTL">
<s:data>
L 0
{innerTL.height-1}
</s:data>
<s:stroke>
<s:SolidColorStroke/>
</s:stroke>
</s:Path>
However, if you change path data argument from "L" to "M" or don't bind its coords to innerTL everything works fine.
