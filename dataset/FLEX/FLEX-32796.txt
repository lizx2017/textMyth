Legend does not display correctly when "Use Flash Text Engine in MX components" is checked
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Compile the attached MXML file with the "Use Flash Text Engine in MX components" checkbox CHECKED.
Actual Results:
The "Profit" label does not appear in the legend. It does appear in the data tips, though.
Expected Results:
Both legend items should appear.
Workaround (if any):
Workaround is to uncheck the "Use Flash Text Engine in MX components" checkbox (which would mean you can't use mirroring with charts), or the manually create the legend items.
