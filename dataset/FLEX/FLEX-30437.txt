Summary:
Invalid elements are retured from IAutomationManager.resolveIDPart in DropDownList
Description:
We call to
automationManager.resolveIDPart(parent, part)
where parent is a spark.components.DropDownList and part is a mx.automation.AutomationIDPart with automationName="Spark"
"Spark" is an element in the DropDownList that is in the list, but currently not visible (because I would have to scroll down a little to make it visible)
In that case, resolveIDPart returns an Array with the ScrollBar (spark.components.VScrollBar) as first Element and ItemRenderers (spark.skins.spark.DefaultItemRenderer) for all visible elements in the list.
This is wrong, because resolveIDPart should return the element with is specified in "part" or nothing if it can't be found.
This leads to a bug if i.e. a QTP script tries to select such an item that is currently not visible.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Use QTP to script a to open a DropDownList
2. script a select to an item that would become visible if you would scroll down a little bit in the DropDownList
Actual Results:
The DropDownList remains open and the item is not selected, but QTP does not report any error
Expected Results:
The item should be selected or QTP should state the item can't be found
Workaround (if any):
script a scroll down to get the item visible before the select
Attached a code snippet which shows such a DropDownList with an Element "Spark" that is initially invisible because you have to scroll down to see it.
