Summary:
QuickTest Professional (QTP) 11 with Flex Addin 4.5 no longer returns a value for width property when using GetROProperty. Worked correctly with QTP 9.5 & Flex Addin 3.0
Description:
QuickTest Professional(QTP) 11 with Flex Addin 4.5 is returning an empty value when using GetROProperty to retrieve the width value of a FlexTextArea object, and other Flex objects, such as FlexApplication.
QTP's Object Spy and Object Repository displays an actual value for the width property (see attachment FlexTextArea_WidthValue.jpg).
However, the line of code below returns no value
wd = Browser("FlexStore").FlexApplication("flexstore").FlexCanvas("Support").FlexForm("index:4").FlexTextArea("Address::address").GetROProperty("width")
(see attachment FlexTextArea_EmptyWidthValue.jpg)
I have tried modifying the TEAFlex.xml file where I add 'ForDescription="true"' for FlexTextArea's width property:
<Property Name="width" ForVerification="true" ForDescription="true">
<Type VariantType="VT_R8"/>
<Description>The width, in pixels, of this object.</Description>
</Property>
After making this change and restarting QTP and the FlexStore app, I continued to run into the same problem.
This works fine when using QTP 9.5 and Flex Addin 3.0
Steps to reproduce:
1. Go to Adobe's FlexStore:
http://examples.adobe.com/flex2/inproduct/lcds/flexstore/flexstore.html
2. Select the 'Support' tab
3. In QTP, generate a GetROProperty step to retrieve the width for the "Address" field in the FlexStore app.
4. When you replay the script, you will see that no value is returned.
