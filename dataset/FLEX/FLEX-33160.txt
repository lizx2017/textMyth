Summary:
automation not working with Apache SDK 4.8.0
Description:
In apache SDK, references to QTP were replaced with Tool. During that process, one genuine reference to QTP also got modified and hence the issue
Under tool.swcâ€™s ToolAdapter class,
ExternalInterface.call("eval",
"if (!window.mx_testing_plugin" + playerID +
".RegisterPluginWithQTP(self, " + "'" + playerID + "'))
{" + "document.getElementById('" + playerID + "').SetLastError('TEAPluginIE.TEAFlexAgentIE is not scriptable'); }");

is modified to

ExternalInterface.call("eval",
"if (!window.mx_testing_plugin" + playerID +
".RegisterPluginWithTool(self, " + "'" + playerID + "')) {" + "document.getElementById('" + playerID + "').SetLastError('TEAPluginIE.TEAFlexAgentIE is not scriptable'); }
");
which should be reverted. Otherwise, the actual call to register our plugin with QTP was not happening and so QTP automation is not working with Apache Flex SDK.
