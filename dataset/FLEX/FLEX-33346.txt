Summary:
Can only target Flash Player 11.1 in Flash Builder
Description:
I've installed Apache Flex 4.9 for use within Flash Builder 4.7 and cannot specify any target Flash player version below 11.1:
"The currently selected Flex SDK requires minimum Adobe Flash Player version 11.1.0."
I know that this is a new feature of this SDK (to target 10.2-11.5) but cannot seem to do it through this software. If there is something that needs to be modified, I do not see instructions in the release notes.
Requested by Frédéric THOMAS.
