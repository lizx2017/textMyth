Summary:
Setting Style to change background color for custom axisLabelRenderer works for titleRenderer but not For labelRenderer
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Attached is the exported flex project file which contains the custom axisLabelRenderer.
2. When you run the project you will see the title label background color is changed but the axis labels background color is not changed although both are using the same custom axisLabelRenderer.
Actual Results: The tilte labels background color is changed but the axis label background color is not changed
Expected Results: As both the titleRenderer and AxisLabelRenderer are using the same custom axisLabelRenderer but the style changes for one but not for other.
Workaround (if any): Suggested to define the style in custom axisLabelRenderer and that fixes the issue but is not acceptable in customer scenario.
