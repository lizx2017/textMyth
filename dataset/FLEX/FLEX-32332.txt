Summary:
OLAPAttribute.allMemberName is not working
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. run attached sample in debug mode
Actual Results:
hierarchy: (AllH)
attribute: (All)
Expected Results:
hierarchy: (AllH)
attribute: (AllA)
If one sets allMemberName it is ignore for OLAPMember but works for OLAPHierarchy. This is particularly annoying when trying to internationalized an application because in the end it affects display name of the members.
