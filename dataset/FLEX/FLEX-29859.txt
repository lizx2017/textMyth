Summary:
Slider.Change is not fired when using keyboard arrows keys
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run the attached MXML file in an application that links to the Automation framework.
2. Automate the following:
-Click in the TextInput control.
-Press Tab to change focus to the slider.
-Press the Right arrow key a few times to change the value of the slider.
3. The only events recorded are "SelectText" to click in the TextInput, and "ChangeFocus" to tab to the Slider. No events were generated when the user pressed the arrow key to change the value of the Slider.
The Slider.Change event does fire, since the number below the Slider in the test app uses that event to update the Label.
If the user clicks on the tracker of the slider instead of the TextInput, and then uses the arrow keys, the Change event is fired as expected.
