Summary:
mobile StageText skin for TextInput breaks TextInput functionality - no click event in ADL
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a mobile project with a TextInput control in it
2. add a click handler to the TextInput's click event
3. click on the text input while running the mobile project in Flash Builder.
Actual Results:
The click event of the TextInput control doesn't fire
Expected Results:
The click event should've been fired. I expect the TextInput component to have the same working features as in a desktop project. Click event should keep working regardless of the used skin, the skin shouldn't influence the available features of the component.
Workaround (if any):
The only way to listen to user click's on the TextInput control is by listening to the focusIn event on the TextInput control, but I don't get the localX and localY mouse values when using the focusIn event.
The click event was working in Flex 4.5, so it's probably StageText that is breaking this.
