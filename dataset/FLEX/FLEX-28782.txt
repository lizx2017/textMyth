Summary:
Scroller+child.mask+child.opaqueBackground causes no mouse interaction
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1.Create a scroller component.
2.Add a child that has a mask and opaqueBackground.
3.Move the scrollbar.
Actual Results:
No mouse interaction with the first scroll position pixels of the child. Probably that part gets cached or something like that.
Expected Results:
To have mouse interaction.
Workaround (if any):
Either remove the opaqueBackground or the mask.
This is happening on Flash Player 11. Works ok in previous versions.
