Summary:
Flex 4.5.1 mobile on iPad - keyboard popup on stagewebview moves titlebar up and doesn't reset.
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. create a mobile app for iPad on ios, include StageWebView for a browser
I used Adobe Air Launchpad to create the app.
2. launch app on iPad, rotate to landscape mode, open up StageWebView for a browser,
Tap on a textfield to popup the keyboard, if textfield is low enough on the page, the keyboard will push up the textfield to be visible and hide the tabNavigator title bar.
3. When keyboard is removed, the titlebar stays hidden and extra space is on the bottom.
Actual Results:
tabNavigator titlebar is hidden when keyboard pops up and doesn't reset when keyboard goes down.
Expected Results:
tabNavigator to re-appear.
