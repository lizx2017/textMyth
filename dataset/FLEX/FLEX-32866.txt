Summary:
BubbleChart does not pickup chart-series-styles style if styleName is changed at runtime
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a BubbleChart
2. Change its styleName after it is addToStage
Actual Results:
The series styles do not change
Expected Results:
Series styles should change
Workaround (if any):
Extend BubbleChart and override styleChanged function
override public function styleChanged(styleProp:String):void
{
if(styleProp == null || styleProp == "styleName")
{ invalidateSeries(); }
super.styleChanged(styleProp);
}
The reason of the bug is that BubbleChart is not calling super.styleChanged in override styleChanged function
