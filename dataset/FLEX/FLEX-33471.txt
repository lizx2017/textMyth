Summary:
Effect.end does not stop effect properly for repeated effects
Description:
I have 2 repeated effects with 1 sec repeatDelay inside a Parallel effect.
When Parallel.end() is called within the repeatDelay effect ends but inner timer does not get cleared and causes an error update after repeatDelay is passed.
Workaround:
listen for EFFECT_END event and substitute the instance's target with stub object or component
See attachment for the code and workaround.
