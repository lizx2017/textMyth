Summary:
adt.jar not found in class path
Description:
The installer creates and SDK folder for Apache Flex 4.16.0.
Note: SDK location: /Applications/Adobe Flash Builder 4.7/sdks/4.16.0
When I try to 'add' the SDK to Adobe Flash Builder 4.7 the operation fails with error:
"adt.jar not found in class path of /Applications/Adobe Flash Builder 4.7/sdks/4.16.0"
The same SDK folder works OK with Adobe Flash Builder 4.6. The add is successful.
I have tried re-downloading the entire SDK with the same results.
Apache Flex 4.15 SDK works OK with both Adobe Flash Builder 4.7 and 4.6.
