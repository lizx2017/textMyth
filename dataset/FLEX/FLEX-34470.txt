Summary:
RTE on s:List#restoreCaretScrollPosition
Description:
My client got an RTE at s:List#restoreCaretScrollPosition.
I could not reproduce this RTE. But I got stack trace.
TypeError: Error #1009

at mx.managers::LayoutManager/doPhasedInstantiationCallback()
I looked at the source and I guess the only reason which causes this error is dataGroup was null.
