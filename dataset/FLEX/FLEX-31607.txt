Summary:
DMV HierarchicalCollections, ItemPendingErrors and ICollectionView
Description:
From Alex:
I was investigating some tree bugs and realized that the DMV HCV would have similar issues. I took a peek at the DMV HCV code and it appears that it is not coded to handle ItemPendingErrors in certain scenarios, nor can it handle sub-collections that are ICollectionView but do not support IList. Matt and I were under the impression that DMV was going to take on this work. More sophisticated paged data from LCDS may exploit these shortcomings.
It would be a duplication of effort if I fixed these issues in the old Tree HCV. We are wondering if the work to handle IPEs and non-ILists is scheduled and when it might be done. We would then experiment to see if the DMV HCV could be plugged into a Tree for those who want to connect a Tree to these more sophisticated backends. Anything that couldn't be safely fixed for us would probably be deferred to Flex4.
I saw that calculateLength uses both [] syntax and does not have try-catch blocks for IPEs. All of the HCV/HVC code should be examined for use of []. moveFirst()/moveNext()/ etc should be used instead and those things have to be in try-catch blocks for IPEs and a recovery strategy needs to be implemented for when the IPEs are caught. This may require rewriting the HVC tree walker to save cursor bookmarks instead of child index
