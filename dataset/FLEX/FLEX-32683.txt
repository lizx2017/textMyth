Summary:
Consistent spelling and source extraction of datavisualization and datavisualisation
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1.Extracting datavisualization_sdk3.5.zip produces the following folder structure ...\frameworks\projects\datavisualisation\src with an S
2.RSLs are named datavisualization with a Z
3.In order to successful work with DMV and browse source from IDE one has to manually copy "SDK\frameworks\projects\datavisualisation" into a new folder "SDK\fbpro\projects\datavisualization". If only it was that easy, we also have to remember to rename datavisualiSation to datavisualiZation
Why does the working framework swf in Flash Builder still look for FBPRO folder when it should just look at "frameworks\projects\datavisualisation\src".
Not to mention Flash Builder looks for the wrong spelling of the word. This is quite hard to catch for people who don't notice this tiny detail.
This issue may have been fixed for Flex 4 but its still there in Flex 3.5. https://bugs.adobe.com/jira/browse/FLEXDMV-2281
