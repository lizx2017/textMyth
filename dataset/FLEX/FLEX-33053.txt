Summary:
Applying filterFunction, grouping, and removing filterFunction doesn't work correctly for initially ungrouped data with GroupingCollection2
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run the sample application, GroupingCollectionSortFilterIssue.mxml. Two items are in the collection.
2. Click the first button, "Add Filter", to add a filter on the HierarchicalCollectionView to filter out the first item
3. Click the second button, "Add Grouping", to group the items by prop1.
4. Click the third button, "Remove Filter", to remove the original filter set on the HierarchicalCollectionView.
Actual Results:
The first item is still filtered out
Expected Results:
The first item should be present in the datagrid
Workaround (if any):
Click the fourth button, "Add workaround", which manually clears out the filterFunction on the underlying grouping collection's source and calls refresh() on it and the grouping collection
