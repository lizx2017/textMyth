Summary:
Column Chart // itemClick Event // pushes an error #1034 [INSIST UPDATE to RELEASE]
Description:
Sudhir Manjunath: Please ACTUALLY read the issue BEFORE TAKING ACTION *****
// WHY WAS THIS REACTIVATED? //
The code snippet below (which handles the 1034 error) also prevents a HSlider event. This means my users can't use the HSLIDER to control the chart's number of viewable months because the error handler prevents the event.
I found this issue during debug mode, when I was trying to assess why the HSLIDER was not working. Again, it turns out the code snippett (chartErrorHandler1034) below actually prohibits other change events in the chart.
In other words, the resolution for this matter is not satisfactory since it causes more issues than it resolves.
// FROM PREVIOUS:
Found in Version: Flex Builder 3, Version 3, build 3.0.194161
**I found at least 2 other recorded iterations of this issue within this Bug database. It's unacceptable to me and my customers to rely on a critical flex component and find it's not working. Being able to click on chart columns are an intregal part of this component.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a Column Chart, connect it to a viable dataprovider
2. Add the an itemClick event with the chart tag <mx:ColumnChart id="myChart" itemClick="chartChange(event.hitData.item)"/>
3. Complie the chart
4. Click on the bar
Actual Results:
Error #1034 is displayed in a dialog box. See error.TXT attachment.
Expected Results:
This should cause an event trigger and execute a function or declare a variable.
Workaround (if any):
**The code below is the temporary workaround, but is unacceptable as it prevents other events as well. For instance, the change="" event trigger for the HSlider component doesn't work because of the work around below.
private function chartErrorHandler1034():void
{
vbChartCY.addEventListener(ChartItemEvent.CHANGE, chartItemEventChange, true, 0, true);
}
private function chartItemEventChange(event:Event):void
{
event.stopImmediatePropagation();
}
