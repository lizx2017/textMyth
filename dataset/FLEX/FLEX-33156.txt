Summary:
focusInHandler() in spark Scroller doesn't null check focusManager property before using
Description:
the focusHandler() method wrongfully assumes that the focusManager is always a valid instance. When checking the focusManager property in UIComponent it is clear that in certain cases this property can return a null value.
So in some cases this can lead to an RTE. I have encountered this once in my current project but find it very hard to reproduce. Basically a Scroller instance that was displayed in a popup window gave this RTE after the popup was removed.
Reproducable or not, I believe the null check should be added seeing the fact that the focusManager property explicitly returns null in some cases.
I have attached a patch file which adds the null check.
