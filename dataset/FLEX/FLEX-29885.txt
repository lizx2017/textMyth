Summary:
"Highlight in Application" does not identify the child applications distinctly when 2 subapplications with same name are loaded in 2 peer children application domains.
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Copy the mxml files and compile them using 4.0.0.4811
2. Run the application "MyMarshalling_AT_Test.mxml" (main app)
(This will load 'sub App 5' in child domain, on creation complete)
3. Start Recording using QTP 9.2.
4. Now, go to the browser and click on "Visa" Radio button in the main app.
5. Click on OK when alert pops up.
6. Click on "Accordion button for panel 2" in "Sub App 5" (in child app)
7. Click on "load App 6" button in subApp1 (on the right side)
8. Click on "load App 5" button in the main app. ( this will load 2nd sub-app in child domain)
9. Now click on "Accordion button for panel 2" in the second sub-app.
10. Click on "load App 6" button in the second sub-app
11. Go to QTP and stop recording.
12. Go to object repository in QTP
13. Click on "Loader5.swf"
14. Click on "Highlight in Application"
[Note: The order of the above mentioned steps are very important to reproduce this issue]
Actual Results: the selected component wont be highlighted in the application
Expected Results: Loader5.swf should be highlighted in the app.
Workaround (if any):
This is happening because, the id of the object changes dynamically.
Using 'Object Spy' find out the property of the object (Loader5.swf) which has changed( In this case, ID)
Change the ID (automationIndex is the distinguisher ) of "Loader5.swf" manually .
After doing this, "Locate in Repository" will work fine.
