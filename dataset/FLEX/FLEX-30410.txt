Summary:
Delegate object couldnot be created
Description:
Please see bug here that you have closed without us being able to respond. I am testing this in 4.1.0.16076.
https://bugs.adobe.com/jira/browse/FLEXENT-1422
Here's is another report of the issue https://bugs.adobe.com/jira/browse/FLEXENT-1421 where the response is that you can't re-produce it.
If you run the code I posted there in debug you will get the following output to the console.
AutomationManager:createDelegate() - Error #1009: Cannot access a property or method of a null object reference.
AutomationManager:createDelegate() - Delegate object couldnot be created
This is because the delegate tries to add a listener to a skin part which at the time is null.
You can still record test and play them back, but you can't record anything specific to that delegate (i.e. the text input on a ComboBox).
Please do not close this bug without any contact as before.
