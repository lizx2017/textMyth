Summary:
QTP.swc expects only one mandatory parameter on events - other usages of i.e. third party components break automation
Description:
Customer tried to automate the third party FlexLib library without success as FlexLib's MDIWindowEvent uses two mandatory events. Because there is nothing in ActionScript that forces developer to type Events only with one mandatory event parameter I would declare any assumptions within the Flex/Automation framework as a defect.
>>> We're using the MDI components of FlexLib in an application that we
>>> are attempting to automate with QTP. We are successfully recording
>>> MDIWindowEvent events which are dispatched when the
>>> close/minimize/etc buttons on an MDIWindow are pressed. We cannot
>>> however replay these events because the following RTE occurs. Error
>>> #1063: Argument count mismatch on
>>> flexlib.mdi.events::MDIWindowEvent(). Expected 2, got 1
>>>
>>> We suspect that replayEvent assumes that the type is the only
>>> mandatory argument required to construct an event. This is not the
>>> case with MDIWindowEvent, so when the event is replayed (by the
>>> AutomationManager?) it cannot be constructed.
>>>
>>> Is this a known limitation of automation and does it mean that
>>> FlexLib applications cannot be fully automated?
