Summary:
LegendItemAutomationImpl does not expose legend items
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a Flex app that has a Chart Legend with items.
2. Compile with automation libraries and use an automation tool to inspect the legend.
3. Legend is exposed to automation hierarchy however the items are missing.
Actual Results:
LegendItemAutomationImpl does not expose legend items
Expected Results:
LegendItemAutomationImpl must expose legend items
Workaround (if any):
Use Flex 4.1 or earlier
Additional:
This is a regression in Flex 4.5.
In Flex 4.1 and earlier LegendItemAutomationImpl extends from ContainerAutomationImpl which exposes its children and thus legend items are exposed to automation.
In Flex 4.5 LegendItemAutomationImpl extends from UIComponentAutomationImpl which does not expose its children.
Possible solutions:
a) Change LegendItemAutomationImpl to extend from ContainerAutomationImpl as it was in older versions.
b) Change LegendItemAutomationImpl to expose legend items via numAutomationChildren/getAutomationChildAt/getAutomationChildren set of functions.
