Summary:
Unable to use sdk 4.9.0 in flash builder
Description:
Followed download/install instructions on http://incubator.apache.org/flex/download.html I am not able to use 4.9.0 sdk:
1. downloaded "Download Apache FlexÂ® 4.9.0 (binaries)" for windows
2. cd <flex.dir>/frameworks
3. ant thirdparty-downloads
4. "y" multiple times within ant process
5. ant finished successfully (4 zip files in /in folder)
I would expect at this stage I am able to use sdk for my projects. But even trying to add sdk into flash builder 4.7 fails with "adt.jar not found in classpath of C:/.../4.9.0"
Investing more time into making sdk working. Copying all files from /in/flex_sdk_4.6.0.zip into main sdk folder (only files that do not exists = no overwrite). I am able now to add sdk into flash builder recognized as "Apache Flex 4.9.0 FP11.1 en_US". But compilation fails with "unable to open 'C:\...\4.9.0\frameworks{playerglobalHome}\11.1\playerglobal.swc' Definitions Unknown Flex Problem"
Also tried 4.8.0 installer (with all dependencies) but received BSOD somewhere at the end of installation.
Please fix install process or provide fully working sdk with all the dependencies just like what we (flex developers) were used to when adobe provided the sdk = download, unzip, use.
