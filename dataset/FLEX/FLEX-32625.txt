Summary:
AdvancedDataGrid not updating if source data is changed
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1.
Create and fill an AdvancedDataGrid using ItemEditors mode RendererIsEditor=true
(In my case I am using a MaskedTextRenderer)
2.
Change the ArrayCollection that is assigned to the dataprovider. (Reassigning the dataprovider or refreshing the ArrayCollection does not help)
Actual Results:
The cells don't reflect the changes I made in the datasource.
Expected Results:
Update of the cells / item editors after I change the data source
Workaround (if any):
Detect the line number when the user is entering a cell using editedItemPosition, and lookup all the children in the grid.
When the child is of the wanted type and the object referenced by the control's listData->Item property matches the object for the current row in the data source, update the control text.
Only editedItemPosition is not always available, especially not when you select a cell and select existing the text in a cell at the same time.
