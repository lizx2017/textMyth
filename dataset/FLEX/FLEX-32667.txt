Summary:
Remove spark.swc's dependency on datavisualization.swc
Description:
The recent addition of two new classes in spark.swc has introduced a dependency on datavisualization.swc
mx.controls.advancedDataGridClasses.FTEAdvancedDataGridItemRenderer
mx.controls.advancedDataGridClasses.MXAdvancedDataGridItemRenderer
We need to remove this dependency so that we can build applications without always needing to load and verify the DMV rsl at runtime.
