Summary:
Missing 2nd SoftKeyboardEvent.ACTIVATE, softKeyboardRect.height remains reported as zero
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run the attached application (keyboard events and height are recorded, most recent at the top)
2. Tap on the top-left StageText
3. Tap on the stage to dismiss the soft keyboard
4. In the top-left text StageText, tap in the top-right corner of that rect
Actual Results:
The following events are recorded (most recent at top)
softKeyboardActivate, softKeyboardRect.height = 0
softKeyboardActivating, softKeyboardRect.height = 0
softKeyboardDeactivate, softKeyboardRect.height = 0
softKeyboardActivate, softKeyboardRect.height = 341
softKeyboardActivate, softKeyboardRect.height = 0
softKeyboardActivating, softKeyboardRect.height = 0
If this does not reproduce at first, use a swipe gesture on the stage to reset. I've found that on the second input (step 4), if you tap directly on existing text, the 2nd activate event will be fired. If you tap in the whitespace of the StageText as directed (so that the cursor is placed at the end of the nearest line), it is not fired.
Expected Results:
Consistent event dispatching.
