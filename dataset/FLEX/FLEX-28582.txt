Summary:
transition inside callout: actionBar title overlaps during transition in SlideViewTransition cover, uncover mode, CrossFade, and Zoom
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run VTTestForSplitViewNavInApp.mxml inside the attached .fxp on iPAD ADL.
2. click on 'open callout'.
3. try 'slide cover right', then watch the actionBar title text.
Actual Results:
the title text briefly overlaps and looks mingled with the incoming view's title text. Please compare with the same SlideViewTransition without callout inside the first ViewNavigator.
Not exactly as apparent as SlideViewTransition, but the same issue is seen also with ZoomView and CrossFadeView Transitions.
Expected Results:
the incoming view's actionbar should slide in and 'cover' the whole area, so the texts should not look overlapped.
