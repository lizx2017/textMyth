Summary:
Sorting doesn't work when columns don't have data fields.
Description:
This bug needs to be fixed after fixing 202635.
Reproduction:
1. Create an ADG with few columns whose data field is not set. Use itemRenderer or label function to display the data. Provide sortCompareFunctions to all the columns.
2. Click on any column header. The column gets sorted.
3. Click on some other column(s).
Actual Results:
The first sorted column's sort order keeps changing.
Expected Results:
The newly clicked column should get sorted similar to DG.
