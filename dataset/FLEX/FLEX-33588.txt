Description:
We have a parent window and use the ExternalInterface.addCallback to control 2 flex app in 2 iframes.
First, the function works in single page and FF21, Chrome. But the function couldn't work in IE. The reproduce steps are listed below:
1.Open the main window, it uses the ExternalInterface.addCallback function to displays the 1st iframe's flex app and does some thing.
