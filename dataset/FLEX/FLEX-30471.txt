Summary:
Child Application Loading Problem
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Use attached "loader.rar" Flex 4.5 Builder project. Use it and change the automation libraries to yours and remove the link to the silktest swc files. (because it is used with silktest)
Whats going on is that in the "loader.mxml" the "ResRegistrationWizard.swf" gets loaded in a child appdomain (line 141).
After loading the swf file he calls on the content of the loader an "init" method (line 105). In this method a canvas is created.
Afterwards he fetches the created canvas over the ".component" method and adds it as a child of a control in the parent application domain (line 109).
When testing the application (click on the launch wizard button) and loading the automation the following error occurs and the automation does not work:
AutomationManager:createDelegate() - Factory module failure
AutomationManager:createDelegate() - Failed in getting the definition or the class or getting the delegate. Automation will not work for this component. com.sybase.scc.view.tasks::ResRegistrationWizardCtrl
AutomationManager:createDelegate() - Unable to find definition for class : com.sybase.scc.view.tasks::ResRegistrationWizardCtrl

When you do not create a new application domain the sample works. (just comment line 141 and uncomment line 144).
I know that normally the application domain support works (also in all our sample applications). I think the special case is that the canvas from the loaded swf file is used as child in the parent appdomain.
Can you please do me the favour to look into this and get back to me if you have any news (if this case is supported or not, or whats the problem is)?
Am I correct if I assume that Application Domain testing support is only available since Flex 4?
Thanks,
Stefan
