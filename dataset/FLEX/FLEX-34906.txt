Summary:
Toggle switch misalignment in Android skin
Description:
I am placing ToggleSwitch controls in an item renderer. Under the ios7 skin the controls are the same size and align correctly. Under the android4 skin the controls are the same size but align differently depending on the control state. The Toggle Switch appears to report a different measuredWidth depending on its value.
I have posted some screen grabs of the problem:
