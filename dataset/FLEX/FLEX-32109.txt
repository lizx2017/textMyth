Summary:
PieChart is blank for innerRadius >= 1
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a PieChart with the innerRadius style set to 30
Actual Results:
Chart is invisible.
Expected Results:
It's easy to make this mistake expecting an innerRadius of 30 pixels â€“ not realizing the value is actually a floating-point proportion instead.
PieChart could treat values >= 1 as something large (e.g. 0.95), but that could still be confusing ("I'm shrinking the number but the hole isn't getting any smaller!").
The best answer is probably to throw an exception indicating that the style's value is invalid and saying what the valid range is.
Workaround (if any):
Read the docs on innerRadius.
