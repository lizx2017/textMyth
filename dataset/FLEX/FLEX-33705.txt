Summary:
DataGridDragProxy created item renderer without a reference to the column
Description:
spark.components.gridClasses.DataGridDragProxy:createChildren()
This method instantiates IGridItemRenderer instances for visual feedback on dragging from a spark datagrid.
IGridItemRenderer has a property column:GridColumn which is not set and will be null for any item renderer created through this mechanism.
Since we have a reference to the column at instantiation time I don't see any problem with assigning it to the instantiated item renderer.
Attached is an example of the issue, and a patch which will assign the column to the item renderer instance
