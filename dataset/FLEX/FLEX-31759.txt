Summary:
ADG doesn't print all rows when output is multi-page, summary rows are used, variable row height w/ item renderers, larger data group not the first data group, all groups open
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Set up ADG w/ summary rows
2. Variable row height w/ item renderer
3. Output is multi-page
4. Order of the data seems to make a difference as well - larger data group not the first data group
5. Groups need to be open - I haven't tested this extensively - but, if all groups are open, the bug is always reproducible
Actual Results: All rows show up on screen but not all rows print
Expected Results: The same rows that appear on screen should also print
Workaround (if any): None
This is for Flex 3 - milestone 3 beta 2 - build 3.0.183654.
