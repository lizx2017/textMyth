Summary:
The area allocated the vertical labels is significantly less in Flex 3
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a new flex project in flex 3.
2. Run the attached mxml file.
Actual Results: The vertical axis label is very small and not easily readable.
Expected Results: The label should be easily readable.
Workaround (if any):
If you look at the source code of the class ChartesianChart.as at line 1732, you will notice the following:
_verticalAxisRenderers[i].heightLimit = verticalAxisRatio * unscaledHeight;
In order to perform a correct calculation, the value of unscaledWidth should be used instead. Once you make the change Flex 3 works correctly again.
