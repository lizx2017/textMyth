Summary:
AdvancedDataGrid keyboard behavior is inconsistent on column headers
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1.Use the Tab key to tab to the AdvancedDataGrid. The Delete button is disabled the first time when no
row is selected.
2.Use Down Arrow key to move the focus to row one and the Delete button is enabled because row one is
selected.
3.Use Up Arrow key to move the focus to the header of the first column.
Actual Results:
After step 3, the Delete button is still enabled.
Expected Results:
After step 3, the Delete button should be disabled because there is no row being selected. When I use
Right Arrow key to move the focus to the header of the second column, the Delete button is disabled. The
Delete button remains disabled when the focus is moved to the header of the third column. Even the focus
is moved back to the header of the first column, the Delete button remains disabled. Only when I use Up
Arrow key to move the focus from row one to the hesder of the first column, the Delete button is
enabled.
