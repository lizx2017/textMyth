Summary:
[Customer] A bubble chart with only one row of data doesn't display
Description:
Reproduction:
1. Create a bubble chart (such as the one in the bug file) with one row of data in the DataProvider
Actual Results:
The bubble doesn't display
uncomment the second row of data and run again and both bubbles display
Expected Results:
If there is just one line of data, that bubble should be displayed
Workaround:
BubbleChart by default has autoAdjust="false" for the radiusAxis. When you set this value to "true" we will calculate the maximum to display the bubble. If you don't do this we will not display the bubble at all. You can also choose to set the maximum and keep autoAdjust set to false if you wanted. Choices A or B will work.
A)
<mx:LinearAxis id="myAxis" autoAdjust="false" maximum="3000" />
B)
<mx:LinearAxis id="myAxis" autoAdjust="true" />
------------ example usage --------------
<mx:LinearAxis id="myAxis" autoAdjust="true" />
<mx:BubbleChart radiusAxis="
{myAxis}
" dataProvider="
{expenses}
" showDataTips="true">
<mx:series>
<mx:BubbleSeries xField="Profit" yField="Expenses" radiusField="Amount"/>
</mx:series>
</mx:BubbleChart>
