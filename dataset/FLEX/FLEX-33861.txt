Summary:
Flex Incorrectly Scaling Down Application on iPad
Description:
After switching my mobile application from 4.10 to 4.11, Flex now scales my application content down, so that everything looks smaller. The TabbedNavigationApplication's applicationDPI property is set to 160. The application was designed for a 1024x768 layout, and in the AIR application descriptor I have the requestedDisplayResolution element set to standard, so that the content looks right on Retina iPads. It seems that now if I remove the applicationDPI property, all Views except for one look close to correct. It seems Flex can no longer use this property correctly.
