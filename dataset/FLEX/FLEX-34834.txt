Summary:
security error when using image tag in html
Description:
SecurityError: Error #2122: Security sandbox violation: Loader.content:
http://mydomain.com/Client/myapplication.swf cannot access
http://differentdomain.com/image.png. A policy file is required, but the
checkPolicyFile flag was not set when this media was loaded.
at flash.display::Loader/get content()
at
flashx.textLayout.elements::InlineGraphicElement/loadCompleteHandler()[/Users/aharui/git/flex/master/flex-tlf/textLayout/src/flashx/textLayout/elements/InlineGraphicElement.as:703]
The image actually loads successfully in-spite of the error, but it doesn't
being measured correctly, so the image can exceed the component's
boundaries and overlap the text after it.
using .swf debug on desktop does not reproduce this. using on browser does regardless if it is debug release or build release.
