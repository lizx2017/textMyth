Summary:
Button's label value has an advantage over explicitly set automationName
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Describe the Button in MXML
<mx: Button id="btn" label="Submit"/>
2. Explicitly specify automationName for Button, e.g "submitForm"
<mx: Button id="btn" label="Submit" automationName="submitForm"/>
3. Start the automated testing rountine
Actual Results:
Button is being recognized by its label by Testing Agent, rather then explicitly set automationName
Workaround:
Modify line 91 in ButtonAutomationImpl.as class in getter for "automationName"
override public function get automationName():String
{ return super.automationName || btn.label || btn.toolTip; }
Now, explictly set property "automationName" has an advantage over button's label when deciding what final automationName for Button will be.
I would like this behaviour to be included by the default into Flex 3 "Halo" Button automation delegate.
