Summary:
CartesianDataCanvas with includeInRanges=false has problems keeping children
Description:
How to reproduce:
Created a CartesianDataCanvas for an AreaChart with a horizontal DateTimeAxis and attempted to add a child with a left value outside the current date range of the chart
1) using addDataChild()
2) using addChild() and then updateDataChild() as shown in the CartesianDataCanvas documentation
Actual Results:
1) Item did not appear.
2) TypeError (null deref)
Expected Results:
Items with coordinates outside the current axis ranges are at least stored so that they can later be displayed when the axis range changes to include their coordinates
Workaround (if any):
If you can do without the ability to remove individual children, subclass CartesianDataCanvas and override removeChild() so that positionChildren()'s removeChild call is ineffective.
