Summary:
Scroller PULL_TENSION_RATIO should not be private.
Description:
Scroller PULL_TENSION_RATIO is a private const. This property is important in customisation meaning, because, for example, modern scrollers don't use overscroll at all. Currently there is no way and no any workaround to change this behaviour (except monkey patching which is very bad).
Quick way to fix this: made this const mx_internal or protected.
