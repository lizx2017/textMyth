Summary:
ItemSnapping : Snapping modes on tile layout in portrait snaps at incorrect row edges
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Use the source file attached for a tile group implementation
2. Set "leading"/"center"/"trailing" snap mode from the radio button
3. Scroll items in the group row by row
Actual Results:
Items dont snap at the correct row edges as expected.
Expected Results:
Items should snap at proper row bounds based on the drag or scroll position set.
Note: This works fine in landscape mode. Seemed to be related to SDK-31017 but the fix does not resolve this.
