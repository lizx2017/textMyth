Summary:
Spark Window (AIR NativeWindow) is freezing on move.
Description:
Spark Window when using in AIR desktop application is freezing when user trying to move it on screen by the title. In debug application this is just unusable, in release - a little bit faster.
It seems that there is a handler on move somewhere that takes too mach. Scout shows nothing, but if I create NativeWindow manually (not through Spark Window) - everything is ok, smooth and nice. But I cant use such a window, because I can't load flex content there in a simple way.
Code examples:
This code opens spark glitchy window:
            var w:Window = new Window();
            w.title = "Example Window";
            w.open();
And this is smooth:
            var nvo:NativeWindowInitOptions = new NativeWindowInitOptions();
            nvo.systemChrome = NativeWindowSystemChrome.STANDARD;
            nvo.type = NativeWindowType.NORMAL;
            nvo.owner = FlexGlobals.topLevelApplication.stage.nativeWindow;

            var nv:NativeWindow = new NativeWindow(nvo);
            nv.activate();
