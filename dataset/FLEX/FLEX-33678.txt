Summary:
DataGrid VerticalScrollBar disappears in CallOut or on StateChange in 4.10.0
Description:
When the datagrid is created it has the vertical scrollbar. When you either change the state of the component where the datagrid is created the scrollbar disappears. Also in a new calloutbutton container the first open (so when the grid is created) it has the scrollbar and then on a reopen it is gone.
The container of the scrollbar is there, but the thumb is gone.
Tested the application on 4.9.1 and the problem was gone.
I will upload a sample project.
