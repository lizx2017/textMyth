Summary:
Using keyboard selection in combobox ignores custom text
Description:
When using keyboard navigation and selection the spark ComboBox control ignores custom text entered by the user.
Steps to reproduce:
Compile and run the following simple application:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<s:WindowedApplication xmlns:fx="http://ns.adobe.com/mxml/2009"
xmlns:s="library://ns.adobe.com/flex/spark"
xmlns:mx="library://ns.adobe.com/flex/mx">
<s:Group>
<s:layout><s:HorizontalLayout /></s:layout>
<s:ComboBox id="myCombo" width="200" >
<s:dataProvider>
<mx:ArrayList>
<fx:String>test1</fx:String>
<fx:String>test2</fx:String>
<fx:String>test3</fx:String>
</mx:ArrayList>
</s:dataProvider>
</s:ComboBox>
<s:TextInput id="myText" width="200" />
</s:Group>
</s:WindowedApplication>
Click in the combo box and type "abc"
Press shift + home
Actual: The selected text is "test1"
Expected: The selected text should be "abc"
I wrote a quick patch for this:
public class TestComboOverride extends ComboBox
{
public function TestComboOverride()
{ super(); }
override mx_internal function keyDownHandlerHelper(event:KeyboardEvent):void
{
if ((event.keyCode == Keyboard.LEFT) || (event.keyCode == Keyboard.RIGHT)
(event.keyCode == Keyboard.HOME) (event.keyCode == Keyboard.END)) { _proposedSelectedIndex = CUSTOM_SELECTED_ITEM; }
super.keyDownHandlerHelper(event);
}
}
The problem appears to be that the _proposedSelectedIndex property remains set to -2 [NO_PROPOSED_SELECTION] while entering the text, where it really should have been -3 [CUSTOM_SELECTED_ITEM] unless the user happened to type a label from the data provider in which case it should have the index of that item.
The DropDownListBase class maintains a "userProposedSelectedIndex" property which appears to overlap in purpose with the proposedSelectedIndex property, but does contain the correct value.
Unfortunately I have not yet been able to identify the exact place where the value of _proposedSelectedIndex affects the selected item in the given scenario.
