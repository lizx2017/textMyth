Summary:
Lost .launch files
Description:
I've just install apache-flex-sdk-installer-3.2.0-bin.exe
I want to use FLEXJS with FlashBuilder , so I'm reading this
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLEX/Using+FlexJS+with+Adobe+Flash+Builder
When says: "Browse to the FlexJS SDK directory and in the "/ide/flashbuilder" folder you will see new launch configurations. Select these and click the Finish button" nothing is imported in my FlexBuilder .. y've seen that there isnÂ´t any .launch in any folder or subfolder of D:\programas\ApacheFlex\flexSdk\ide\flashbuilder
