Summary:
QTP will not record actions on Flex app when certain js functions are within the wrapper file
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a wrapper file for a flex app that includes json.js and/or prototype.js and a runtimeloading swf (which includes the automation libraries).
2. Start recording a new test in QTP and launch the flex app using the wrapper.
3. Start performing actions in the Flex app, they will not be recorded.
Actual Results:
Actions in the Flex app are not recorded by QTP
Expected Results:
Actions in the Flex app should be recorded by QTP
Workaround (if any):
None short of removing the javascript files (which in our case are essential to the way the app processes).
