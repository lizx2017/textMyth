Summary:
Events not removing
Description:
Events added as part of mxml can not be removed. Even some of the events come default without creating them. Add a list component and create handler for "applicationComplete" event in application tag and check if the list component is having event listener for "change", (using hasEventListener(Event.CHANGE)) it will exist even though I haven't added one. Apart from this, If I add "changing" in List mxml like <s:List id="list" changing="changingHandler()" />, I cannot remove the listener for "changing" event, even if I try to remove and test to see the same by using "hasEventListener('changing')" with the list component, its returning "true" only and never "false". The generated actionscript gives a hint like its creating own listeners and if we use the same listener to remove in application we see the output for "hasEventListener('changing')" is false.
