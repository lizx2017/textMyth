Summary:
OLAPAttribute.allMemberName is not working
Description:
i have the same question like this : https://bugs.adobe.com/jira/browse/FLEXDMV-1940?page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:all-tabpanel
Actual Results:
hierarchy: (AllH)
attribute: (All)
Expected Results:
hierarchy: (AllH)
attribute: (AllA)
If one sets allMemberName it is ignore for OLAPMember but works for OLAPHierarchy. This is particularly annoying when trying to internationalized an application because in the end it affects display name of the members.
please tell me how to solve. thanks
