Workaround (if any):
none found
tried with 4.0 sdk from flash builder and several of the nightly 4.0 sdk;s
in all cases I am trying to used the datavisuliztion* from flashbuilder sdk4.0
I did find that the rls singmature
http://fpdownload.adobe.com/pub/swz/flex/4.0.0.7219/datavisualization_4.0.0.7219.swz
does respond if I substitute the nightly build number, and I can get then nightly build swz that way, but not the matching swc
Searched the bug database, IHMO this is not a duplicate
