Summary:
centerPopUp() doesn't work correctly with layoutDirection=='rtl'
Description:
Hello,
I am working on the 4.6 SDK on a rtl application and I see that the center pop up issue is constantly reproduced over there.
I saw that on https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLEX-24552 you have stated that the issue had been solved.
Can you please advise if there is an official version with this fix I can download in order to make it work?
Thanks in advance,
Tamar
