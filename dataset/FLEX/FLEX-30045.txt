Summary:
Playback is not happening on JavaDialog that popped up by clicking on Flex Button
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
Record the following steps using QTP, with the add-ins (Java,Web,Flex) selected:
1. Click on any flex button, that opens a Java Dialog (For example, Browse flex button opens a "Select files" java dialog.)
2. Select a file from java dialog
3. Close java dialog
Actual Results:
Clicking on flex button is done, but the execution control is not returned to the next statement until the Java dialog is closed manually.
Expected Results:
Clicking on flex button should be executed and recorded lines on Java dialog must also work properly.
Workaround (if any):
No workaround since the execution control is not release by click method of FlexButton.
