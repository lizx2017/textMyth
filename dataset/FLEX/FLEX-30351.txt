Summary:
QTP unable to capture "y" co-ordinate of a control
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1.Open QTP
2.Open a Flex Application which is QTP compatible
3.Spy on any control and verify the object properties and verify the value for "y" property of the control
I have a framework which tracks controls by using runtime co-ordinates and now I am not able to use it because of "y" displaying blank
Actual Results:
Blank("") is displayed instead of runtime "y" co-ordinates
Expected Results:
Expect value for "y" co-ordinate instead of blank
