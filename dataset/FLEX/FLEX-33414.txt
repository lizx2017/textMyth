Summary:
Null textInput in ComboBox
Description:
commitProperties does a check that textInput in not bull, but at the end of the function assumes it's not null:
// Clear the TextInput because we were programmatically set to NO_SELECTION
// We call this after super.commitProperties because commitSelection might have
// changed the value to NO_SELECTION
if (selectedIndexChanged && selectedIndex == NO_SELECTION)
textInput.text = "";
I have a situation where textInput was null and caused an error there.
I propose moving the code up into the scope of the check for textInput like this:
override protected function commitProperties():void
{
// Keep track of whether selectedIndex was programmatically changed
var selectedIndexChanged:Boolean = _proposedSelectedIndex != NO_PROPOSED_SELECTION;
// If selectedIndex was set to CUSTOM_SELECTED_ITEM, and no selectedItem was specified,
// then don't change the selectedIndex
if (_proposedSelectedIndex == CUSTOM_SELECTED_ITEM &&
_pendingSelectedItem == undefined)
{ _proposedSelectedIndex = NO_PROPOSED_SELECTION; }
super.commitProperties();
if (textInput)
{
if (maxCharsChanged)
{ textInput.maxChars = _maxChars; maxCharsChanged = false; }
if (promptChanged)
{ textInput.prompt = _prompt; promptChanged = false; }
if (restrictChanged)
{ textInput.restrict = _restrict; restrictChanged = false; }
if (typicalItemChanged)
{
if (typicalItem != null)
{ var itemString:String = LabelUtil.itemToLabel(typicalItem, labelField, labelFunction); textInput.widthInChars = itemString.length; }
else
{ // Just set it back to the default value textInput.widthInChars = 10; }
typicalItemChanged = false;
}
// Clear the TextInput because we were programmatically set to NO_SELECTION
// We call this after super.commitProperties because commitSelection might have
// changed the value to NO_SELECTION
if (selectedIndexChanged && selectedIndex == NO_SELECTION)
textInput.text = "";
}
}
