Summary:
Flex2 automation testing of custom components with QTP
Description:
Hi,
Can anybody help me to resolve the following issues when we test custom components with QTP: I am implementing Automation testing of flex components with qtp ver9.1 and adobe flex2
1. when we instrument the cuatom components and create a custom event, QTP records the flex application but does not replay the same.
2. When we add custom events for our standard components facing the same issue that it does not replay the event.
3. I dont know what object paramater to pass through replay click method of the helper class.
Steps to reproduce:
1.create custom class
2. add custom events
3.create delagate classes required to enable qtp integration with flex 2.
4. QTP records the application
5. QTP does not replay the events.
Actual Results:
QTP does not replay the custom events even for standard components and custom components.
Expected Results:
It should replay the custom events.
Workaround (if any):
I am referring to the pdf file attached... below.. for the same.The custom events and components work well for the example arleady quoted in the pdf but cause a problem when i try for my own custom components or events.
