Summary:
Panel's title value has an advantage over explicitly set 'automationName'
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Describe the Button in MXML
<mx: Button id="btn" label="Submit"/>
2. Explicitly specify automationName for Button, e.g "submitForm"
<mx: Button id="btn" label="Submit" automationName="submitForm"/>
3. Start the automated testing routine
Actual Results:
Panel is being recognized by its title by Testing Agent, rather then explicitly set automationName
Workaround:
Modify line 92 in PanelAutomationImpl.as class in getter for "automationName"
override public function get automationName():String
{ return super.automationName || panel.title; }
Now, explicitly set property "automationName" has an advantage over panel's title when deciding what final automationName for Panel will be.
I would like this behaviour to be included by the default into Flex 3 "Halo" Button automation delegate.
