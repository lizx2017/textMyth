Summary:
ADG Scrolling (very) rough, jerky with only medium sized data set
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
I've attached two files as a sample: StockTradeTest.mxml and a data xml file (Stocks_Demo_all.xml, needs to be in data subdirectory). The ADG has only 41 records and 25 columns.
Actual Results:
An ADG with only 41 rows and 25 columns already shows signs of rough, jerky scrolling especially during horizontal scrolling when you drag the thumb at a reasonable speed. Now if you add labelFunctions, styleFunctions and itemRenderers to the mix the scrolling becomes painfully jagged with the mouse cursor far ahead of the thumb that is being dragged. The horizontal drag/scroll seems to be much more affected than the vertical drag/scroll.
Expected Results:
Smooth scrolling
