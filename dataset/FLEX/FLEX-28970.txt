Summary:
Giving focus on a flex Application hides Windows 7 SP1 language bar when in Chrome
Description:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<s:Application xmlns:fx="http://ns.adobe.com/mxml/2009"
xmlns:s="library://ns.adobe.com/flex/spark"
xmlns:mx="library://ns.adobe.com/flex/mx"
width="300" height="300">
<s:Rect width="300" height="300">
<s:fill>
<s:SolidColor color="0x000000" />
</s:fill>
</s:Rect>
<s:TextInput width="100" verticalCenter="0" horizontalCenter="0" />
</s:Application>
Steps to reproduce:
1. just click somewhere on the example flex app and the language bar should disappear. Use the TextInput to test this - a friend of mine along with this can't change the language with a key combination, I can though and when I type the language is correct, but to him it's not.
2. not sure if it should be here, but another difference I see is that IE9 64 bit sets the focus to null when the app loses focus (clicked outside) and when clicked back nothing has focus while firefox and chrome give the focus back to what last had it - TextInput in this case. Not sure which is the correct behavior. I guess if there was an event when a flex app loses focus and gets focus, I could work around this, but as far as I know there isn't. Correct me if I'm wrong.
Actual Results:
1. Giving focus on a flex Application hides Windows 7 SP1 language bar when in Chrome and maybe sometimes you can't change the language even with a key combination - testable in TextInput.
2. IE9 64bit loses focus on the component when clicking out of a flex app and then back in, unlike firefox and chrome.
Expected Results:
1. Windows 7 SP1 language bar to be visible at all times so the user can change the language from there when he want to enter text in a TextInput in a different language.
2. Either component focus is lost when a flex app loses focus or it doesn't - behavior should be the same for browsers.
