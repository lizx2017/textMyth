Summary:
RTL Tooltip is not presented well in RTL languages
Description:
The Tooltip component is not presented well in RTL languages like Hebrew and Arabic.
It seems that the adobe team didn't take care of this issue, hence when it used in spark labels for example the text is idented to the left (as the default ltr layout does)
