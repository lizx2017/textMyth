Summary:
When fontFamily is defined in non ASCII, Flex 4.5 SDK doesn't recognize the setting (Flex 4.1 SDK does)
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run the attached Main.mxml on a machine which has MS PMincho font with Flex 4.5.1 SDK
2. Using IME, type some Japanese into both two TextInputs
Actual Results:
The first TextInput does not recognize the fontFamily setting.
Expected Results:
This is a regression issue. If you compile on Flex 4.1 SDK, the first TextInput does recognize the fontFamily as the second TextInput does.
