No workaround
I have tried copying locale de_DE files from sdk4.0.0 to sdk/3.5.0/framework/locale but the application didnt compiles with it, althought there was no error, but application was not loading when I opened it.
Please let me know from where I can get the locale specific automation bundles for sdk 3.5.0 in locale de_DE.
