Summary:
Reflection API expose methods without classes that can't be used
Description:
Reflection API has some classes like getClassByAlias or getDefinitionByName that are methods in files that has no Class declaration. Each file has a package and directly a method is declared.
While other classes in the SWC like HTTPService are accesible, the before mentioned one are not.
I'm trying to get compile with maven without luck, and can't do it with some fix for this. I'm trying to get RemoteObject AMF working on FlexJS side and need the reflection API support.
Thanks
