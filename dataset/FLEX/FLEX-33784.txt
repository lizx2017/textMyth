Summary:
"mxmlc -dump-config some_file.xml" expects an output file for compiling
Description:
On dumping a file without compiling anything the compiler will complain that an output file is needed and return with 1. I think the option -dump-config should work like -version and be enough (but maybe still provide the ability to optionally begin a compiling process).
