Summary:
Unable to create a second series(in bubble chart) whose bubble sizes are not relative to the first series.
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. One could use a secondSeries in a bubblechart to create a second series whose bubble sizes were not relative to the first series. For example a series whose radius values are 1,2,3, and another bubble series whose radius values are 10,20,30. When the chart is rendered using secondSeries, both series' bubbles are the same size.
Doing that now does not have that effect. Now, the radius 30 in the second series is 10 times larger than the radius 3 bubble in the first series.
Actual Results: Radius of second series in the bubble chart is relative to the first series
Expected Results: to create a second series whose bubbles are not relative to the first series
