Summary:
Dynamically setting spark Label's text property on runtime causes application to crash on mobile device.
Description:
I've replicated this with AIR 2.7.1 installed on an Android 2.2 mobile device(HTC Desire). The issue seems to be also related to the version of AIR as when I change the AIR version to 2.6, the app worked fine. I built the app initially with 4.5.0 and later updated to 4.5.1 in an attempt to solve the issue.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a mobile application with a label binding to a text input. See below
Example 1:
<s:TextInput id="inptTxt"/>
<s:Label text="
{inptTxt}
"/>
or
Example 2:
protected function changeHandler(event:Event):void
{
lblTxt.text = event.toString();
}
<s:TextInput change="changeHandler(event)"/>
<s:Label id="lblTxt"/>
2. Run the application on Mobile.
3. Start typing with soft keyboard on the text input component.
Actual Results:
Application crashes or just stops.
Expected Results:
Label displays text that was input in the text input component.
Workaround (if any):
Change AIR version to 2.6 from AIR 2.7.1
