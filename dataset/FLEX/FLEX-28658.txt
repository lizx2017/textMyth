Summary:
softKeyboardActivate is dispatched with incorrect stage.softKeyboardRect if the suggestion bar was up, but disappeared
Description:
Problem:
Some devices have soft keyboards installed which grow vertically to display a suggestion bar (as opposed to soft keyboards that are always the same size regardless of whether suggestions are displayed). On such devices, if a StageText is given focus while the suggestion bar is up, the softKeyboardActivate gets dispatched while stage.softKeyboardRect has the dimensions of the keyboard with the suggestion bar even though the suggestion bar has been removed.
Method:
1) Run the attached app on a device whose soft keyboard grows to display the suggestion bar (e.g. an older Samsung Galaxy Tab running Android 2.2).
2) Tap one of the StageTexts and note the dumped dimensions of the softKeyboardRect.
3) Type something to cause the suggestion bar to show up.
4) While the suggestion bar is up, tap the other StageText and note the dumped dimensions of the softKeyboardRect.
Result:
The dimensions of softKeyboardRect for the second tap reflect the size of the soft keyboard including the suggestion bar despite the fact that the suggestion bar has been removed.
Expected:
Correct soft keyboard dimensions.
