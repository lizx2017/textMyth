Summary:
Automated tests have 30 action limit even with professional version installed
Description:
We are trying to use the QTP plugin for automated testing. However, builds that are produced by our build machine always have the 30 script step limit, even though we have a Professional version of Flash Builder installed on that machine. There was a time when we did not have a professional version installed, but we thought that installing the professional version should correct this.
When we build on one of our developer's machines, using professional, we are not restricted by the 30 step limit. We have tried installing and re-installing and are at a loss as to why we cannot get past this. Is there anything we can look for, in registry, file system or output SWF files that would help us to identify the problem?
