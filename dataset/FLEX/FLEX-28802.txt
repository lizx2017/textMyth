Summary:
SystemManager.screen resizes to invalid intermediate heights when soft keyboard is active on Android
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run the attached application on Android in portrait (no scaling, no resizing for soft keyboard)
2. Observe the list which logs the SystemManager screen.width x screen.height
3. Focus on the TextInput
4. Rotate to landscape
5. Focus on the TextInput again
6. Rotate to portrait
Actual Results:
Results on an HTC EVO 3D with qHD resolution at 540x960
4. When going from portrait to landscape, the dimensions change to 960x142 and 960x502
6. When going from landscape to portrait, the dimensions change from 540x520 to 520x562 then 540x922
Expected Results:
The only valid screen size values (not in full screen) should have been 960x502 and 540x922.
It appears the the stageWidth and stageHeight are incorrect when the keyboard is up before an orientation change. UTR on iPad. The intermediate size causes extraneous and incorrect sizing of Callout which listens for SystemManager resize events.
