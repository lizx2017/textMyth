Summary:
Issues with grid when horizontal scroll policy is auto
Description:
Description:
ADG's 'left' and 'right' properties are set to 200. Grid contains 3 columns each has minWidth equal to 1000.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run the attached .swf file.
2.
3.
Actual Results:
ADG's size does not care of its 'right' property and goes out of the Applicaiton window ( with an application scroll bar )
Expected Results:
ADG's should be set such that its left and right end should be 200 pixels from left and right edges (respectively) of the application window. And its own horizontal scroll bar should handle the minWidth of columns.
