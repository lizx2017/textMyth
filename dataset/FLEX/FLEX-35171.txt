Summary:
CSS color RGB not set in component
Description:
I want to set a color:#fff
If I put in a css class external selector, this is not applied (but rest of rules works ok).
If I put in inline style, this is working ok.
If you want to see the code is in MDLExample, App.mxml line 117:
<mdl:CardTitle className="cardTitle" style="color: #fff;">. <-- I need to set the color here to get text inside this component white, if not it gets black
The css style is mdl-styles.css
.cardTitle
{
color: #fff; <--- this rule is not working
height: 176px;
}
