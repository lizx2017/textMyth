Summary:
FalconJX should be aware of Date properties
Description:
ActionScript Date has both properties (date.time) and setter/getters (date.getTime()). Javascript has only setter/getter functions.
Code in ActionScript that will be cross-compiled should be able to use date.time and have it cross-compiled to date.getTime().
Workaround: use date.getTime() in ActionScript.
