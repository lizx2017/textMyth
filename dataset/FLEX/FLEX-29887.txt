Summary:
There's no way to verify a menu item is disabled
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create an app that has some menu items, some of which are disabled
2. Try to create a checkpoint on verifying that a menu item is disabled
Actual Results:
There's no property on menu item to indicate if it's enabled or disabled. The actual enabled property is always true. The menu item renderer class when showing a disabled menu item, disables the child label, but not the menu item itself. Further there's no exposed style that you can test to see if the menu item is disabled.
Expected Results:
That there is some way to determine/verify if a menu item is disabled.
