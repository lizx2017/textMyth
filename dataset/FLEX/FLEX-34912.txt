Summary:
Object class in JS.swc is not dynamic, resulting in error when setting properties
Description:
Try the following code:
var test:Object = {};
test.whatever = "some value";
The compiler will give the following error:
Access of possibly undefined property whatever.
The reason is because the Object class in JS.swc isn't marked as dynamic.
There is a workaround. A property can be set with square brackets:
test["whatever"] = "some value";
