Summary:
StylableTextField silent fail on setting percentWidth or percentHeight
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a StyleableTextField.
2. Set the percentWidth or percentHeight property on it.
3. Trace the percentWidth or percentHeight property.
Actual Results: outputs NaN, whatever the value set is.
Expected Results: Should output the value set (see below, should throw an Error).
Workaround (if any): StyleableTextField does not support percentWidth or percentHeight, therefore a silent fail wastes developers time. If the property is not supported, it should throw an error so we know about it and can move on.
