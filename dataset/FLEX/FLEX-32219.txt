Summary:
Advanced Data Grid Data Binding in GroupingCollection inside Repeater Not Allowed Because not Visual Child
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create an Advanced Data Grid within a Repeater (within a Repeater?) and assign a dataProvider to a GroupingCollection.
Actual Results:
The following error prevents building: "Unable to generate initialization code within Repeater, due to id or data binding on a component that is not a visual child."
Expected Results:
If the dataProvider source is simply assigned within the AdvancedDataGrid tag it works fine. But as soon as it is moved into the GroupingCollection tag it chokes.
Workaround (if any):
None known.
Disclaimer:
I am very new to Flex and first tried getting an answer to this problem elsewhere (see http://blog.flexexamples.com/2007/08/27/charting-in-flex-builder-3-public-beta-1-edition/#comment-14206) where it was recommended I put this here. My apologies if I have made an elementary error and this is actually just a bug in my brain!
Also, I'm not sure how the version system works so I left the Build blank and I think I put the correct Version (hopefully?). Feel free to update that!
