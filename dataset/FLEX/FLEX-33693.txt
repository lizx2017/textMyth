Summary:
TLF Lists which have ParagraphElements with hanging indents do not render correctly
Description:
A hanging indent is defined by setting the paragraphStartIndent to a positive number and the textIndent to an inverse negative number. This work correctly as long as you specify a tab stop at the position of the paragraphStartIndent. (I don't know if this desired behavior or not.)
If the paragraph is in a ListItemElement, the text is not tabbed to the position of the paragraphStartIndent. It seems the textIndent value is subtracted for the calculated tab location of the entire line. The text is instead tabbed to the next tab position.
Possible workaround:
Specifying a tab position at double the paragraphStartIndent causes the text to look correct, but only because the text is shifted to the left the amount of the textIndent.
Below, I will attach a sample application which illustrates these points.
