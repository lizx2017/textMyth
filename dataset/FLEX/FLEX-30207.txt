Summary:
TEAPluginQTP.dll causes an unhandler win32 exception
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Start QTP 10.0
2. Record interaction with flex UI
3. Replay script
Actual Results:
QTP 0 (version 10.0.4864.0 - 0907/2009 3.38 pm) 'crashes' when replaying a recorded script resulting in an 'unhandled win32 exception' pop up.
After poking around in the debugger it appears that it is not really a crash but either an ASSERT or DebugBreak that has been triggered. I say this because the exception is a result of executing an 'int 3' instruction. The call occurs at offset 0x4984 in the text section of TEAPluginQTP.dll (version 2.0.154.159 - 23/09/2009 5.03pm)and is the result of a failed test of some kind, so it looks like some kind of unrecoverable error has been checked for and detected. Since the dll is stripped I can't be more specific, but hopefully you can track this back to the check in the source code to figure out what is wrong.
Expected Results:
No crash
Workaround (if any):
No work around found yet. The registry seems set up correctly and the appropriate dlls seem to be loaded (i.e. TEAPluginQTP.dll and TEAPluginIE.dll, amongst others, in QTP and actxprxy.dll in the browser). I haven't found mention of a similar crash in various forums either.
