Summary:
Incorrect Totals (upgrade from v3.0.0 to v.3.3 produces incorrect summary)
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create an OLAP Cube
2. Create a query and selectively add members (not using 'members' or 'children' - using findMember) to OLAP sets for both X & Y axes.
3. Add "(All)" (or default member) member to both the sets (using findMember)
4. Execute query and attach results to the ODG
Actual Results:
"(All)" column/row shows the total (aggregate) of all members rather than the selected members in the query. Means, calculating subtotal is not possible using OLAP grid anymore. - in sdk 3.3.
Expected Results:
Total (aggregate) of selected members should be displayed. - sdk 3.0 behaved like this, and we have an entire application based on this functionality.
Workaround (if any):
Stay in sdk 3.0 without upgrading to sdk 3.3.
Notes:
We have an entire reporting application that shows sub-totals and totals of user selected members using a visual filter. As soon as we upgraded to sdk 3.3, the entire business reporting was stopped and had to do a rollback to 3.0.
I realize that this change has been implemented as part of fixing FLEXDMV-1811. Recalculation of the aggregate measures on OLAP query based on the selected members is the standard functionality of any OLAP or BI reporting tool.
