Summary:
LabelRotation not working inside <mx:Module>
Description:
Hi,
I have developed a chart inwhich I want labelRotation for my X-Axis.
I am able to see that this works fine when I use chart inside mx:Application.
but the same thing is not working if I am using chart inside a module.
I would like to know if this is a known issue in Flex 3 or is there a way to solve this issue.
