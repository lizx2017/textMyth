Summary:
Cannot change only the height of StageText with certain initial geometry
Description:
Problem: If StageText is given a viewPort where x == y and width == height (there may be other possibilities, but that is the easiest one to reproduce), changing only the height of the StageText does nothing.
Method:
1) Build and run the attached app.
2) Tap the red sprite.
Result:
Nothing happens.
Expected:
The StageText's height should change.
