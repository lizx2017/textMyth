Summary:
Custom TreeItemRenderer causes RFT automation to fail
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a custom TreeItemRenderer with no functionality. Extend TreeItemRenderer.
2. Create a screen with a tree that uses the custom TreeItemRenderer. Compile with automation framework libs.
2. Create an RFT (or FlexMonkey) test that attempts to open the branches of the tree and click the nodes.
Actual Results:
RFT gives null pointer exception when the tree branch is clicked. FlexMonkey throws an exception that the automation delegate for the TreeItem cannot be found.
Expected Results:
Tree branches would be operational using custom TreeItemRenderers, even without custom delegates as there is no new behavior and the AutomationManager should seek the superclass of the TreeItemRenderer and use the delegate associated to that class.
