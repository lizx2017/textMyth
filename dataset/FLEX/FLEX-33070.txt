Summary:
Mustella build file issues
Description:
Two issues in this report:
the Mustella build file currently references compc.exe and mxmlc.exe. This should be changed so that the *.bat files are referenced instead. See the "setup_windows" task.
the env.properties file is not included in the build script.
