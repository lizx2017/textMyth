Summary:
Multiple y-axis charts don't compute axis bounds correctly
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. run the attached MXML application
2. notice there only one orange column (instead of seven)
Actual Results: The left vertical axis' bounds are computed based only on the green series' values. Since the orange series' values are larger than the green series, the bars would go off the top of the chart, and are therefore omitted from the chart.
Expected Results: The vertical axis should compute it's bounds based on all series rendered against it (green and orange).
Workaround (if any): Specifying explicit bounds for the axis overrides the incorrect computation, but puts the onus of selecting appropriate bounds on the developer, which is quite undesirable.
I see this behaviour with the SDKs bundled with both Beta 2 and Beta 3 of FlexBuilder. The latter is build 190133, which wasn't in any of the build dropdowns, so I opted for "none".
