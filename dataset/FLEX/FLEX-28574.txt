Summary:
Japanese characters don't provoke any validation
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1.Launch the application(WindowedApplication with a spark Textinput (the same happens with a mx component) which has a StringValidator.
2.Change your keyboard input to japanese (Hiragana)
3.Type "wo" in the textinput, a japanese character is displayed (the textinput stays valid)
4.Remove the japanese character by pressing backspace (the textinput becomes invalid)
5. Type again the combination "wo" in order to display a japanese character.
Actual Results:
The textinput stays INVALID
Expected Results:
The textinput should become VALID
Workaround (if any):
If you press enter or focus another window and come back, the validator works agin and validate the textinput. It's as if the change event was not launched (the doValidation function is not called) when a japanese character is typed.
