Summary:
some Flex projects not loading in Chrome
Description:
Some Flex projects are not loading in Chrome (Pepper Flash Player).
It's irrelevant which Flex SDK is used. Some projects with Adobe Flex SDK 4.6.0 and some with Apache Flex SDK 4.9.0 are not working. But other projects are working with this SDKs.
My system:
Mac OS X 10.8.3
System Language German
Chrome Version 27.0.1423.0 dev with 11.6.602.171 Pepper Flash Player
Some days ago the
Chrome Version 25.0.1364.172 with 11.6.602.180 Pepper Flash Player
also didn't load the projects. But now this Chrome loads the project. And I didn't changed anything. Very very strange.
All the projects, which are not working in Chrome are loading in Firefox, Safari or IE without any problems.
I should also mention that this issue is not easy reproducible! When the swf didn't worked in Chrome 25 on my Mac, I have tested on another Mac with Chrome 25 and the swf worked.
[I know, it seems that Chrome is causing this issue, but I am not sure. Anyway, I created the bug here because I want to be sure that this is not a Flex issue and also for documentation.]
