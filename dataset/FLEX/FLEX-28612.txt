Summary:
Callout bounds do not resize during orientation change, but the Callout's content area resizes, causing clipping of content.
Description:
During orientation changes, the Callout bounds (including the Callout and its arrow) do not change size, but the content inside the Callout does change size. This causes content inside the Callout to be clipped after an orientation change.
Note that this behavior is different on each form factor. The Callout will resize differently based on screen size/DPI, but the general problem is the same. I ran the following test case on a Motorola XOOM (Android 3.2).
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a default Flex mobile project in Flash Builder (The default is based on a ViewNavigatorApplication).
2. Copy the following code into the home View:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<s:View xmlns:fx="http://ns.adobe.com/mxml/2009"
xmlns:s="library://ns.adobe.com/flex/spark"
title="HomeView">
<s:CalloutButton>
<s:Group width="300" height="300">
<s:TextInput left="20" right="20" top="20" bottom="20"/>
</s:Group>
</s:CalloutButton>
</s:View>
3. Run it on a Motorola XOOM (Android 3.2). Make sure the device is in landscape orientation when you start the app.
4. Tap the button.
5. Tap the TextInput in the Callout that comes up.
6. Rotate the device into portrait orientation.
Actual Results:
7. The Group with the TextInput will be clipped at the bottom.
Expected Results:
8. The Callout content area should not have changed in size.
Other Information:
This seems like a layout issue, perhaps in Callout's updateDisplayList.
Workaround (if any):
None identified yet.
