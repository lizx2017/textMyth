Summary:
AdvancedDataGrid doesn't use 'calculateDropIndex' in the dragDropHandler
Description:
Create a subclass of AdvancedDataGrid, overriding the `calculateDropIndex` function:
class MyDataGrid extends AdvancedDataGrid {
function MyDataGrid()
{ super(); }
override public function caculateDropIndex(event:DragEvent=null):int
{ return 0; }
}
The drop feedback will show the correct drop location, but when the item is dropped it will fall into the default location.
This is the version of ADG which comes with Flex 3 SDK 3.2.0.
