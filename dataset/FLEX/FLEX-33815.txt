Summary:
TextArea focus near bottom of screen on iOS causes screen bounce
Description:
A TextArea near the bottom of a screen on an iOS device causes the screen to bounce up and down. After receiving focus, the softkeyboard activates, then deactivates, then activates again, resulting in an unpleasant bouncing effect. It only happens on TextAreas on the lower part of the screen, below where the softkeyboard is raised. I could only reproduce this when the skin class is set to spark.skins.mobile.TextAreaSkin. StageText skins, and the TextInput component do not have this issue.
