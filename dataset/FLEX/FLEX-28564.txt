Summary:
Files written to an android device using applicationStorageDirectory DO NOT GET PERSISTED.
Description:
One of our existing apps has ceased to function properly since the last AIR update for Android.
We've traced this to some behaviour associated with applicationStorageDirectory/resolvePath. The given file is simply never created, although it can be re-opened and read so long as the application is not closed (probably the reason why your tests passed)?
Permissions to write to external media are ENABLED in the manifest before you ask.
Below is a simple test case which demonstrates the problem.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Paste this into a Flex Mobile Project
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<s:Application xmlns:fx="http://ns.adobe.com/mxml/2009"
xmlns:s="library://ns.adobe.com/flex/spark" creationComplete="testWrite()">
<fx:Declarations>
<!-- Place non-visual elements (e.g., services, value objects) here -->
</fx:Declarations>
<fx:Script>
<![CDATA[
function testWrite() : void{
var prefsFile:File = File.applicationStorageDirectory; //DOES NOT WORK
prefsFile = prefsFile.resolvePath("preferences.xml"); //DOES NOT WORK
prefsFile.createDirectory();
//var prefsFile : File = new File('/mnt/sdcard/zzzzzz.out'); //WORKS
if (!prefsFile.exists) {
var stream : FileStream = new FileStream();
try
{ stream.open(prefsFile, FileMode.WRITE); stream.writeUTFBytes("A test string"); stream.close(); successful.text = "OK WRITTEN : " + prefsFile.nativePath; }
catch (e : Error)
{ successful.text = "FAIL during write : "+prefsFile.nativePath; }
} else {
successful.text = "FILE already existed : "prefsFile.nativePath " DIR LISTING : ";
var contents = prefsFile.getDirectoryListing();
var i : int = 0;
for (i = 0; i < contents.length; i++)
{ successful.text += contents[i].name+" : "; }
}
}
]]
>
</fx:Script>
<s:Label id="successful"/>
</s:Application>
Actual Results:
The file is not written out.
Expected Results:
Workaround (if any):
Comment in the hard coded path to the sdcard to see it working.
