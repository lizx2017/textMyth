Summary:
Spark List selection on mobile doesn't work properly
Description:
The touch selection of list items on the actual device does not work properly.
Sometimes, even though the touch has definitely been recognized by the device, the list selection change isn't committed, instead the previously selected item remains selected.
To reproduce the issue, please set up a new Flex mobile project and add the most basic list with inline renderer to a view:
<s:List id="myList" width="100%" height="100%">
<s:dataProvider>
<s:ArrayCollection>
<fx:Object label="Item1" />
.....
<fx:Object label="Item30" />
</s:ArrayCollection>
</s:dataProvider>
</s:List>
Deploy the app to an actual device (this bug does NOT appear in the emulator!) and randomly try to select items, scroll the list, select again and so on. You'll notice that the down color is sometimes set, but the selection isn't changed.
