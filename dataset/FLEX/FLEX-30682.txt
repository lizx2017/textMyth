Summary:
Cells with custom ItemRenderers does not display properly after grouping
Description:
Reproduction:
1. Download the attached Flex application
2. Unzip and compile "ADGSample.mxml"
3. Execute "ADGSample.swf" and verify that proper data is being displayed.
4. Click on "Group" button
5. All the grouped rows should not display any red background becuase of the logic inside the code.
6. But, you can see that even grouped rows display red background with some junk data.
7. Scroll down few rows and scroll back to top row. And this intermittently displays the proper values ( i.e no color for grouped rows).
8. In some scenarios, even the data in Non-Grouped rows is lost and the same data from grouped rows is displayed in Non-grouped rows too.
Actual Results:
Cells does not render properly according to ItemRenderer behavior.
Expected Results:
All Cells, grouped & Non-Grouped rows should render properly.
Workaround:
Scrolling up and down the ADG will intermittently fix the issue.
