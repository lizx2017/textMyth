Summary:
Setting percentHeight to 100 at runtime doesn't update Button's new height value
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Put a Button into a Group which has 50 pixel of height.
2. Set Button's percentHeight to 100.
3. Get Button's updated height value.
Actual Results: Button's height not updated after percentHeight has been set to 100.
