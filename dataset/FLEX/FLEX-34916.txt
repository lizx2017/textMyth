Summary:
DataGrid doesn't refresh sorting when formatter applied to sorted column
Description:
Steps to reproduce: run the attached project (the steps are on the stage).
Summary: when the user sorts by a column in a DataGrid and then a formatter is applied to that column, the sorting is not refreshed to reflect the impact of the formatter.
Note: this cannot be seen for simple dataFields (e.g. "name") due to FLEX-34917, but it can be reproduced for complex dataFields (e.g. "address.street").
