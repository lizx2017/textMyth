Summary:
Chart labels not showing when using embedded FlashType fonts with Charts in PopupManager, RSL.
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Use FlashType fonts (embedded fonts) in the application.
2. Display a chart inside a popup manager (e.g. titlewindow)
3. Compile the application using RSL (framework.swc, datavisualization.swc and rpc.swc)
Actual Results:
Chart labels not showing.
Expected Results:
When using embedded fonts, labels should show regardless if the chart is in a popup container or not. If the chart's container is not in a popup manager, chart labels are displayed.
If the application is not compiled using RSL the chart labels (embedded fonts) in the popup container are displaying correctly.
