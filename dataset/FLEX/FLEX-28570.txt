Summary:
RichEditableText restrict property doesn't restrict text copied in if a non-restricted character is not present.
Description:
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Compile and run the selected application.
2. Copy and paste '%%%%%' into the RichEditableText.
3. Copy and paste '%%%%%4' into the RichEditableText.
Actual Results
The first copy and paste succeeds, entering text that shouldn't be allowed in the field.
The second copy and paste does not, correctly displaying only the '4', an allowed character.
Expected Results
The first copy and paste fails: No text should be entered because none is valid.
Notes:
This has been tried with variations of text using spark:TextInput and spark:TextArea. Both exhibit the behavior.
