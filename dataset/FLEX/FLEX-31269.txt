Summary:
[Customer] columnWidthRatio and offset on ColumnSet MXML tag are not recognized
Description:
Reproduction:
1. See bugfile or simply create a ColumnSet and add columnWidthRatio and offset to the MXML tag.
Actual Results:
Column sets are not positioned according to the parameters on the MXML tags.
Expected Results:
Column sets positioned properly
Workaround:
Use ActionScript to change the columnWidthRatio and offset properties of the ColumnSets. The problem with this however, is that the Chart appears and then the columns shift to the new positions, resulting in a visible jump of the columns.
