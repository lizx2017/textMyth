Summary:
TextInput component ignores autoCapitalize, autoCorrect, and softKeyboardType properties when using TextInputSkin skin
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. add a textinput in a flex mobile project then do one or more of the following:
2. set the autoCapitalize property to "none"
3. set the autoCorrect property to "false"
4. set the softKeyboard property to "number"
5. create a custom skin and set the skin either in a css file or by setting the skin property of the component. (note: I have tried just making a skin as simple as extending the TextInputSkin with nothing else but calling the super() method, and I have tried coping the actual TextInputSkin myself and setting the skin to that file and the functionality will not work)
Actual Results: Text input will still use autocorrect, auto capitalize and only show the regular keyboard. Removing the skin results in the functionality working properly.
Expected Results: Text input with custom skin should not allow auto correcting or auto capitalization of text being typed, correct type of keyboard should appear as well.
