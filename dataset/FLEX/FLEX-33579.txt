Summary:
Setting OpenDuration =1 does not work in ADJ getting http://bugs.adobe.com/jira/browse/SDK-26550
Description:
I am using TreeGrid component whichi is extension of advancedDatagarid, I can see openduration=1 in my code of expandItem, But still I am facing the issue mentiond
http://bugs.adobe.com/jira/browse/SDK-26550.
Basically if you select a node in a tree at a given list index, then you expand or collapse branches, you then can't select the node that's now at that list index. The component incorrectly thinks you're trying to select the same node so it doesn't let you select it, but it's not the same node anymore because of the expand or collapse.
