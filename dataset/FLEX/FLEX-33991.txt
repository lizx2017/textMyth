Summary:
PopUpAnchor caches initial popup size with no way to reset
Description:
addOrRemovePopUp contains this code:
if (popUp is UIComponent && !popUpSizeCaptured)
{ popUpWidth = UIComponent(popUp).explicitWidth; popUpHeight = UIComponent(popUp).explicitHeight; UIComponent(popUp).validateNow(); popUpSizeCaptured = true; }
popUpSizeCaptured is never set to false even if popUp is changed.
All methods and properties are private so can't be easily fixed.
