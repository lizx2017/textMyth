Summary:
Flex automation replay is not working on ViewStack navigator component
Description:
We have a flex automation testing methodology, which works using the Flex AutoQuick concept. There is a problem in playing back the recorded user interactions on the Flex application which uses "ViewStack navigator container".
Recording on the attached flestore application happens correctly. But when playing back the recorded steps which includes tab change events, some times the playback hangs from the point where the tab click occurs.
Find the attached flexstore sample application,
Steps to reproduce:
1. unzip and deploy the code in webserver.
2. open http://<web-server>/flexstore/index.html
3. You can see the Automation popup window appeared on top of the flexstore application.
4. Click on record button, and perform user events on the flexstore application which includes tab clicks on Home, Products and Support. Clicking on stop button, shows the recorded steps in the textarea.
5. Restart your Flex application by either refreshing the browser or closing and reopening the browser.
6. Copy the recorded script from your text editor and paste it into the Automation pop-up window's text area.
7. Clicking on the play button, performs the playback of the recorded steps.
8. Repeat the same, by recording the tab (includes ViewStack mechanism) change events in flexstore application. It stops playback after the tab change event.
Thanks in advance.
