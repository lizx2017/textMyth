Summary:
Flex view state caching
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1.Source Code download is here(http://bit.ly/flex_state_video1) if you want to build the app and run
2.There are 4 states. Everytime I go from State1->State2->State3 or State1->State2->State4, the memory in internet explorer increases, but is not released.
I checked the documentation for "Controlling caching of objects created in a view state" and set the itemDestructionPolicy="auto". It still is caching the objects and memory is not being released as seen in the Task Manager.
