Summary:
Incorrect date in datefield popup for fr_FR locale
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a new project
2. Set the compiler arguments to "-locale fr_FR"
3. Add the following line to the main application:
<mx:DateField selectedDate="{new Date(2016, 6, 4, 13)}"/>
4. Run the application and click on the calendar icon
Expected result:
The selected date should be the 4th of JULY, which it is if you set the locale to "en_US"
Actual result:
The selected date is the 4th of JUNE
Possible reason:
Because the abbreviation of june and july is the same in French ("Jui"), the popup probably finds the first month who's abbreviated name matches the selected abbreviated name and thus incorrectly sets the month to June
