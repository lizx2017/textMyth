Summary:
CalloutButton drop shadow rendering problems - floating lines and overlapping sections of the shadow
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. add a calloutbutton with a specific size â€“ code is attached, this produced a callout box 87px x 77px
<s:CalloutButton id="cbtn" label="try me" open="cbtn_openHandler(event)">
<s:Group id="cbtn_contents" addedToStage="cbtn_contents_addedToStageHandler(event)">
<s:layout>
<s:VerticalLayout paddingTop="10" paddingRight="10" paddingBottom="10" paddingLeft="10" />
</s:layout>
<s:Label id="cbtn_label" text="inside?" />
</s:Group>
</s:CalloutButton>
Actual Results:
See annotated screen capture. Floating lines outside of two shadow edges. Irregular drop shadow, looks like overlapping shadow areas.
Expected Results:
Smooth shadows, no extra lines.
Workaround (if any):
Adjusting the size of the callout will alter the rendering. The screenshot is a worst case example. There is at least one in between state, and sometimes it looks fine.
NOTE:
I marked this bug as reproducible "every time" because when adjusted to a particular size it will always appear.
Output using android device simulator, using DroidX configuration.
