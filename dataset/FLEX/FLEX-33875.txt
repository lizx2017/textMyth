Summary:
Runtime error #1069 in MobileSkin class on focus out
Description:
Hiting tab to move focus away from component which has pure AS skin without hostComponent property defined results in runtime error.
Error happens in the endHighlightBitmapCapture of MobileSkin:
public function endHighlightBitmapCapture():Boolean
{
var exclusions:Array = focusSkinExclusions;
if (!exclusions)
{ if (this["hostComponent"] is SkinnableComponent) exclusions = SkinnableComponent(this["hostComponent"]).suggestedFocusSkinExclusions; }
Note that property accessed as dynamic property but there is no check for property existence. It should be there just like in case of beginHighlightBitmapCapture:
public function beginHighlightBitmapCapture():Boolean
{
var exclusions:Array = focusSkinExclusions;
if (!exclusions)
{ if (("hostComponent" in this) && this["hostComponent"] is SkinnableComponent) exclusions = SkinnableComponent(this["hostComponent"]).suggestedFocusSkinExclusions; }
