Summary:
SpinnerList hide bottom elements instead of cropping them
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Add a SpinnerList within a SpinnerListContainer
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<s:View xmlns:fx="http://ns.adobe.com/mxml/2009"
xmlns:s="library://ns.adobe.com/flex/spark" title="SpinnerListView">
<fx:Script>
<![CDATA[
import mx.collections.ArrayCollection;
[Bindable]
private var _dp:ArrayCollection = new ArrayCollection(["blah", "hey", "yo", "File", "+Save", "+Load", "Edit", "+Copy", "one", "two", "three" ]);
]]
>
</fx:Script>
<s:SpinnerListContainer>
<s:SpinnerList dataProvider="{_dp}" width="400" height="150" />
</s:SpinnerListContainer>
</s:View>
2. Scroll slowly in that list. The list labels are nicely cropped at the top but they are hidden when they are at the bottom, hard to explain
3.
Actual Results:
Bottom element is hidden
Expected Results:
Bottom element should be cropped
