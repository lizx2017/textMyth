Summary:
App closing on back key in Android
Description:
App is closing on android when keyboard is active and user press back button twice.
It's very important for app with multiple views, but it's also actual for every type of mobile app except pure mobile as3.
Way to reproduce:
1) Activate keyboard at the second view in textInput.
2) Press back. (Keyboard will disappear.)
3) Press back. App will exit, but it' will not return to the previous view, as it should be.
There is no such issue in emulator.
Sample project: http://francisaltomare.com/_etc/TestBackKey.fxp
I can attach pure as3 project and standard mobile application project with such issue if it is needed.
I've briefly reviewed flex source and I can't say if it is a flex problem or the problem in air and flex interaction, but in pure AS project there is no such issue.
