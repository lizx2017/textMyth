Summary:
DateTimeAxis ignores interval for large datasets
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a chart using DateTimeAxis for the x-axis
2. Set the axis' interval to "1", dataUnits to "hours"
3. Create a sample set of data that spans a large number of hours (greater than 20 or so)
Actual Results:
Labels are generated every 2 hours
Expected Results:
Labels generated every hour - possibly shown on two rows if space is tight.
Reproducibility depends on the width of the graph and size of your dataset. It seems that the Axis adjusts the interval to create a reasonable number of labels despite what you specified for interval, minorTickInterval, etc. On the contrary, if you specify a larger interval - for example 3, it will use that.
See attached project to reproduce.
