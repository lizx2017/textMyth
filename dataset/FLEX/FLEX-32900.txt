Summary:
JAWS 10 does not announce the name of the leaf node if Hierarchical AdvancedDataGrid has change event handler
Description:
When a Hierarchical AdvancedDataGrid control implements a change event handler, JAWS 10 reads the leaf node incorrectly while it reads a Hierarchical AdvancedDataGrid control without an event handler correctly.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Turn on JAWS 10 and press Insert+Z to turn Virtual PC Cursor mode off (I have to do this to get AdvancedDataGrid
navigation working).
2. Load application and tab to the AdvancedDataGrid control in the "Without change listener" panel use Arrow keys to navigate the
leaf nodes and JAWS 10 pronounces every leaf node in focus correctly.
3. Tab to the "With change listener" panel and use Arrow keys to navigate the leaf nodes.
Actual Results:
JAWS 10 announces the folder nodes but never announce the leaf nodes.
Expected Results:
JAWS 10 should announce every leaf node in focus correctly.
Workaround (if any):
None.
