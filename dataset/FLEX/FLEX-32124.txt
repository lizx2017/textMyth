Summary:
baseAtZero gets overridden when addtional axis is added to the chart.
Description:
I have baseAtZero set to false at the axis (both original and the one added later).
But when I add an additional axis to the chart and then add a new series (which uses the new axis) the original axis changes scale (see image).
