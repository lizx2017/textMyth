Summary:
[compile generate code issue]the "ID" property setter was not called if object is not an IDeferredInstantiationUIComponent instance
Description:
i created a class named "MyClassJustExtendsSprite" that direct extends Sprite.
then i place an instance via inline-code in Declarations tags like below
<fx:Declarations>
<locals:MyClassJustExtendsSprite x="100" y="100" id="mySprite" />
</fx:Declarations>
then i debug the code,i found the x,y setters arrived,however the id setter not.
and as i add -keep in compile options,and i found some codes like this in myproject-generated.as
// supporting function definitions for properties, events, styles, effects
private function _MyProject_MyClassJustExtendsSprite1_i() : MyClassJustExtendsSprite
{
var temp : MyClassJustExtendsSprite = new MyClassJustExtendsSprite();
temp.x = 100;
temp.y = 100;
mySprite= temp;
mx.binding.BindingManager.executeBindings(this, "mySprite", mySprite);
return temp;
}
i think you guys lost something,
where is the "temp.id = 'mySprite';"
then i set my class implements IDeferredInstantiationUIComponent,things going well.
but i think it should not be mandatory
