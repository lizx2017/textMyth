Summary:
DateTimeAxis: week start is always Sunday
Description:
When the DateTimeAxis shows weekly labels, the weeks always start on Sunday. For example, when showing labels for May 2010, the labels are 05/02, 05/09, 05/16, 05/23, and 05/30. This is wrong at least in most of Europe, where weeks start on Monday. Also, ISO 8601 has the week start on Monday. The week start should be configurable, similar to the DateChooser.firstDayOfWeek attribute. But it should at least honor the firstDayOfWeek resource string.
