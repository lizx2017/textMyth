Summary:
Editable ADG columns with columnSpan != 1 can only be edited if clicked within the original column's width
Description:
Here is a simple example:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<mx:Application xmlns:mx="http://www.adobe.com/2006/mxml">
<mx:XMLList id="xmlList">
<item name="abc" phone="xyx" email="abc@xyz"/>
<item text="Some text that spans all columns."/>
<item name="123" phone="456" email="123@456"/>
</mx:XMLList>
<mx:AdvancedDataGrid dataProvider="
{xmlList}
" editable="true">
<mx:columns>
<mx:AdvancedDataGridColumn dataField="@text" headerText="" width="10"/>
<mx:AdvancedDataGridColumn dataField="@name" headerText="Name"/>
<mx:AdvancedDataGridColumn dataField="@phone" headerText="Phone"/>
<mx:AdvancedDataGridColumn dataField="@email" headerText="Email"/>
</mx:columns>
<mx:rendererProviders>
<mx:AdvancedDataGridRendererProvider dataField="@text" columnSpan="0"
renderer="mx.controls.advancedDataGridClasses.AdvancedDataGridItemRenderer"/>
</mx:rendererProviders>
</mx:AdvancedDataGrid>
</mx:Application>
This example shows an editable AdvancedDataGrid with three rows. The middle row is special, as it contains one long string that spans all columns. However, if you click on the long string, which should allow you to edit that string, you instead end up (most of the time) editing one of the cells that the string is meant to be spanning over. I would expect that clicking anywhere on the long string would allow you to edit that string.
Of course, you can still edit the long string by clicking within the width of the first column (in this example, just 10 pixels starting at the left edge).
So it seems that the column spanning is not really spanning columns as such, but rather just not-clipping the original column's right border.
