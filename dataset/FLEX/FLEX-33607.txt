Summary:
AsyncListView does not seem to handle item removal notification properly
Description:
When notifying an AsyncListView that items have been removed, the itemResponders matching the items to the right of the removal are shifted to the left, which is correct, but the itemResponders for the removed items themselves are not removed.
mx.collections.AsyncListView.as

  private function handleCollectionChangeEvent(ce:CollectionEvent):void
    {
   ...     
        switch (ce.kind)
        {
         ...                               
        case CollectionEventKind.REMOVE:
                shiftPendingRespondersLeft(ce);
                break;
One of the consequences is that if you truncate the client list (ie remove N items at the end) and send a remove notification, the pending responders are not removed
