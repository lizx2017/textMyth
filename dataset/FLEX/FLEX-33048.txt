Summary:
ColumnSeries.dataFunction "Type Coercion failed" error because of first param type
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Take the demo attached to FLEXDMV-2684
2. Change first parameter type of ColumnSeries.dataFunction to be as doc says "series:Series"
3. Run and get "Type Coercion failed" error at startup at ColumnChart.as line 677 (because there goes "this")
4. Change param type to ColumnChart and you will get the same error in Series.as line 1380
Actual Results:
"Type Coercion failed" error at startup
Expected Results:
No errors
Workaround (if any):
Change first parameter type of ColumnSeries.dataFunction to Object (but it will be pain in the ass if you will need to use this parameter)
