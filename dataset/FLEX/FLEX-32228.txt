Summary:
First Axis label missing or not displayed using DateTimeAxis
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run this code http://bugs.adobe.com/jira/secure/attachment/10415/WorkWeekAxis.mxml
or see attachments.
Actual Results: Notice that there are no first axis label shown in the chart if DateTimeAxis labelUnits is set to months.
<mx:DateTimeAxis labelUnits="months" dataUnits="months" />
Expected Results: The first axis label should be rendered
Workaround (if any): "labelUnits" should be set to days in order to view the first label. but the sense of the information is wrong.
<mx:DateTimeAxis title="
{horizontalDisplayName}
" labelUnits="days" />.
