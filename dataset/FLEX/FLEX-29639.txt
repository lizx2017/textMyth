Summary:
Same objects are being recorded as different objects
Description:
This is because we are writing out verification properties in the description XML (but shouldn't).
To reproduce, record in QTP and do a repeated action in Flex app. Note that each time a new object is created in QTP, when it should be the same one, i.e.
FlexButton("foo").click
FlexButton("foo_1").click
FlexButton("foo_2").click
instead of:
FlexButton("foo").click
FlexButton("foo").click
FlexButton("foo").click
