Summary:
Unable to identify Flex objects in my application
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Install IE 6
2. Install flash player 9.0.x. Install QTP 9.5 and Flex plugin
3. Compile Flex 3 application with the automation library files: automation.swc, automation_agent.swc, qtp.swc and automation_dmv.swc
Actual Results: QTP 9.5 should be able to identify flex objects. However QTP is able to identify objects in the sample application FlexstoreV2. But when i try to record test cases in my Flex application. No script is getting generated.
