Summary:
TabBar shouldn't be colorized in TabNavigatorSkin
Description:
In spark.skins.TabNavigatorSkin skin of spark.containers.Navigator experimental component,
the tab bar is not in the exclusions, which means it will be colorized.
However, since a TabBar has itself alredy a SparkSkin, colorization will apply twice.
The result is that the tab bar appears darker or more saturated than the rest.
