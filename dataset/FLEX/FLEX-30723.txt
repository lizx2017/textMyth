Summary:
Behavior of arrow keys should be in accordance to visual positioning of chart item
Description:
Reproduction:
1. In line chart with multiple series and category axis (run bug file)
2. Select an item on second series such that there is one item above and one below it (visually)
3. Press UP and DOWN keys
Actual Results:
Pressing UP arrow key selects the chart item in downward direction and vice versa
Expected Results:
Keyboard navigation should be in accordance to visual positioning. So UP arrow key should move to item visually UP to current item
Ideally behavior for each chart should be defined differently. For e.g. UP and DOWN keys on column chart doesnt make any appeal based on visual positioning. while in plot chart all four navigation keys apply based on visual positioning..
