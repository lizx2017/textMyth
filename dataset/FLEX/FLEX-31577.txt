Summary:
AdvancedDataGrid is missing enumeration metadata from sortFontStyle, sortFontWeight
Description:
AdvancedDataGrid declares its sortFontStyle and sortFontWeight style properties with no enumeration metadata, as follows:
[Style(name="sortFontStyle", type="String", inherit="yes")]
It should declare them with the same metadata we use for fontWeight and fontStyle:
[Style(name="fontStyle", type="String", enumeration="normal,italic", inherit="yes")]
The missing metadata means Flex Builder cannot offer code hints for the values of these styles. It also means the CSS Properties Inspector is forced to use a plain text field instead of a dropdown for editing these properties. The former will come for free with this fix, and the latter requires a manual update on the FB side. (Since the ADG team is responsible for FB's ADG features, the FB change can be made at the same time as this fix).
