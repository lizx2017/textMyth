Summary:
Logical error: self-reference in GridHeaderViewLayout
Description:
const columns:IList = columns;
columns always evaluates to null which results in the rest of the method never being evaluated. Recommend changing to:
const columns:IList = grid.columns;
https://github.com/apache/flex-sdk/blob/develop/frameworks/projects/spark/src/spark/components/gridClasses/GridHeaderViewLayout.as#L607
I cannot find any inherited property, field or parameter called 'columns'.
