Summary:
ARLabelData class in AxisRenderer.as is causing memory leak with every new update of dataProvider in ColumnChart
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create an application with ColumnChart component. Start profiling the application.
2. Change value of the dataProvider property of the chart.
3. Observe creation of ARLableData class instances - 9 with every update of dataProvider.
Actual Results:
There are always growing number of ARLableData instances with every update of the dataProvider
Expected Results: Static value for number of ARLableData instances.
Workaround (if any): N/A and garbage collection doesn't remove ARLableData instances.
