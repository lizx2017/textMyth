Summary:
AdvancedDataGrid Does Not Update When A Non-Top-Level Node is Added to its XMLListCollection DataProvider
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Compile the provided test case and debug it.
2. Expand all of the disclosures in both the ADG (left) and Tree (right).
3. Click the "Add New Top Level Item" button.
4. Note that this adds correctly to both the ADG and Tree.
5. Now click the "Add New California Child" button.
6. Note that this node is only added correctly in the Tree, but not the ADG.
If you try this again with the disclosures unexpanded to start (e.g. add a few children to California before expanding the disclosures on the ADG), observe that the ADG will add child nodes correctly UNTIL the child node's parent (California) has been disclosed for the first time. Once you do that, the ADG will no longer show any subsquently added child nodes.
Actual Results:
Newly added child nodes do not appear on the ADG. Compare to the Tree.
Expected Results:
Newly added child nodes should appear on the ADG as they currently do on the Tree.
Workaround (if any):
None known.
