Summary:
Flash Builder Scroll Issue
Description:
We have a Flash Builder project that contains a module that will be loaded later through an AIR application, there are several screens on it, in one of them there is a spark spark dataGrid with multiple columns GridColumn.
Some of these columns have associated itemRenderers these itemRenderes are created in separate files based on elements GridItemRenderer Spark, within them there is a spark ComboBox component when the user selects a value from comboBox, GridItemRenderer itself updates the value of "data" with the new selected value.
The problem comes when you scroll at the datagrid, the values of these columns "dance" from line to line; weÂ´ve tried to solve this problem using a itemEditor and a itemRenderer at the columns but in initializing itemEditor gave us null pointer to initialize the moduleFactory the defaultItemEditor.
Finally we had to change the dataGrid and use mx components to achieve properly run our screen.
