Summary:
DescribeType.getJSONFunction do not provide declaredBy for variables.
Description:
DescribeType.getJSONFunction works very well, and is a good way to get access to publics class members. Accessors and Functions JSON records has property "declaredBy" well populated, but not variables. Should be, because any public variable can be inherited from extended classes.
