Summary:
[Dependent] PrintAdvancedDataGrid not working correctly with AIR 2.5
Description:
Compiler versions:
Flex SDK: 4.1.0.16076
AIR SDK: 2.0.2.12610 (the version that was shipped with the Flex SDK 4.1.0.16076)
The following bug occurs after I updated my AIR runtime from 2.0.2.12610 to the current AIR runtime 2.5.1.17730 (note: I updated the AIR runtime on the clients and not the AIR SDK)
Steps to reproduce:
1. create a AIR project
2. add a PrintAdvancedDataGrid to you project
3. you can add some ItemRenderers if you want (you don't have to)
4. create AIR file and start application (I have AIR 2.5.1.17730 installed)
Actual Results:
my PrintAdvancedDataGrid is not shown correctly
some lines and content of the grid is missing
Expected Results:
PrintAdvancedDataGrid will be printed correctly
Workaround (if any):
In my AIRTest.air I used the print example from the following page http://help.adobe.com/de_DE/AS3LCR/Flex_4.0/mx/printing/PrintAdvancedDataGrid.html?allClasses=1 and updated the source code for Flex 4.1
File Attachments:
AIRTest.air: you can install this file to test the printing
AIRTest.mxml: source code of the example
AIRTestNotWorking.png: PRINTED WITH AIR 2.5.1.17730 -> actual print result of the AIRTest application
AIRTestWorking.png: PRINTED WITH AIR 2.0.2.12610 -> expected print result of the AIRTest application
ExampleNotWorking.png: PRINTED WITH AIR 2.5.1.17730 -> actual print result of my own application (look at the grid lines and checkboxes)
ExampleWorking.png: PRINTED WITH AIR 2.0.2.12610 -> expected print result of my own application (all grid lines and checkboxes were printed)
