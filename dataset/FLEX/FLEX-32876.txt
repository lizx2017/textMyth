Summary:
Changing an OLAPCube already refreshed in Actionscrip
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create an OLAPCube, assign a dataProvider, assign an elements array with OLAPDimensions and OLAPMeasures, and refresh the cube (cube.refresh()).
2. Run a query on the cube with all the members specified by the dimensions and measures. The result is OK.
3. Now create a new array with the same elements added on step 1, and add one more OLAPMeasure. Assign this new array to cube.elements, and refresh the cube again.
4. Now, if you run a new query with the same members, more the new members added by the new OLAPMeasure, the result will contain only the first measure.
Problem:
After the first refresh of cube, it dimension collection contains all the OLAPDimensions where isMeasure = false, and one OLAPDimension where isMeasure = true. The second time you assign the elements and refresh the cube, the OLAPDimension that is measure disappear.
I think that this happens because the cube have a dictionary "_dimensionMap" that stores the OLAPDimension with measures, and after you assigned the new elements, this dictionary doesn't remove the dimension.
When you call refresh again, the function verify if already exists the measures dimension (on the dictionary), and don't add the new measures dimension to the dimensions collection. (line 627 @ OLAPCube)
Workaround (if any):
You have to create a new cube every time that You want to refresh him with new measures.
