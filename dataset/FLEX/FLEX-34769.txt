Summary:
TLF Performance issue (applyLeafFormat method)
Description:
I have a very strange performance difference between 2 versions of TextLayout.swc. The first one is the swc included in Apache Flex 4.14 SDK and the second one is included in Apache Flex 4.9.1.
I have a very large text, more or less 200 DIN-A4 pages in a Textflow. I scroll to the end of the document and I underline a word. This is my result underling a word in both versions.
Flex SDK Version Time
4.9.1 21 ms (miliseconds). 0,02 Seconds
4.14 3.405 ms (miliseconds). 3,4 Seconds
The time difference happens in this line of code:
EditManager.applyLeafFormat(oFormat);
Anyone has any idea what's the problem?
