Summary:
get Application.id returning Application.Name
Description:
I created a Flex Web Application where I need to give the app focus.
Btw. ts is for some internally, kinda a User configuration.
In my html document stands:
var ts=7;
var attributes = {};
attributes.id = "program";
attributes.name = "program?ts=" + ts;
attributes.align = "middle";
swfobject.embedSWF(
"program.swf?ts=" +ts, "flashContent",
"100%", "100%",
swfVersionStr, xiSwfUrlStr,
flashvars, params, attributes);
swfobject.createCSS("#flashContent", "display:block;text-align:left;");
So I used this line to set Focus within pMain:
ExternalInterface.call("function()
{ var app = document.getElementById('"+id+"'); app.tabIndex = 0; app.focus(); }
");
But the id (from spark.components.Application get id) is returning:
program?ts=2
And the focus isn't set.
But if I write:
ExternalInterface.call("function()
{ var app = document.getElementById('program'); app.tabIndex = 0; app.focus(); }
");
The focus is set.
spark.components.id is a get Function for ExtenalInterface, but its getting the name of the application and not the id set in Javascript.
