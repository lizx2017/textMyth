Summary:
Vertical labels scaled unnecessarily
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
Run the attached mxml file.
Actual Results:
The vertical labels are scaled extremely small and are not usable.
Expected Results:
The vertical axis should take up more space to make the labels readable.
Additional Info:
If you remove the <mx: verticalAxisRenderers> tags completely, the the scaling problem goes away. Also if you revert to using the deprecated tags '<mx: verticalAxisRenderer>' the scaling problem also goes away.
