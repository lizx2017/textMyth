Summary:
Sorted AdvancedDataGrid problem when adding and selecting a new item
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
Steps to reproduce:
1) Fill a AdvancedDataGrid with object data
2) User sorts the grid using header click
3) User or system adds a new object to the grid and in the same process system sets the AdvancedDataGrid's selectedItem property to the newly added
4) An error is produced when referencing the selectedItem
Actual Results:
When investigating this issue, it appears that the selectedItem property is set to null, although the selectedIndex value does have a number. The grid "looks" fine (i.e. it has the row highlighted correctly)... but there is nothing in selectedItem.
This only seems to happen when adding, immediately selecting (with code) a new object when the grid is currently sorted. Also, a user generated event (i.e. click) WILL select the row just fine.
Expected Results:
The item is selected as requested (both selectedIndex and selectedItem)
