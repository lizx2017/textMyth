Summary:
QTP 9.5 with Flex add in 3.0.0 not recording script for Flex application
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1.Launch QTP 9.5 with Flex Addin
2.Try to record the script for Flex application for our application(compiled in Flex builder 3.0.2)
3.Try to record the script for Sample Flex application provided by adobe
Actual Results:
Scripts are getting generated for Sample Flex application but For our application scripts are not getting generated.
Expected Results:
Scripts should be recorded for both the application
More Information:-
Our development team already compiled the application as mentioned in the thread.The problem is -Scripts are not getting recorded,though the objects are getting identified by Object Spy of QTP 9.5.But when we look into object property through object spy, we found the most of the Object property of the Flex objects are same.When we added those objects manually in the object repository and trying to highlight the objects then objects are not getting highlighted in the application.It is showing the error message that the object properties are not unique.One thing I need to mention here my FLex addin is 3.0.0 and the application is compiled using Flex builder 3.0.2.Is this creating a problem?
