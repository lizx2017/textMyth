Summary:
[FlexJS] 'border-style' overrides 'border' regardless of specificity level (flash)
Description:
In classic CSS a specific selector overrides a general one, but this doesn't work for many components on the flash side with border.
To reporoduce an example of the problem, go to defaults.css in the html package and make the following change:
from
/* Global style declaration */
*
{
font-family: "Arial";
font-size: 12px;
border-width: 1px;
}
to
/* Global style declaration */
*
{
font-family: "Arial";
font-size: 12px;
border-width: 1px;
border-style: none;
}
The effect will be that borders for buttons are no longer visible. This is a bug because button's css is:
Button
{
background-color: #f8f8f8;
border: 1px solid #808080;
border-radius: 2px;
padding: 4px;
margin: 0px;
}
On the JS side it works.
