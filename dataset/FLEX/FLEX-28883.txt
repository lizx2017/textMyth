Summary:
List.requireSelection doesn't always work
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a ListCollectionView and a filterFunction to it.
2. Create a List set requireSelection to 'true' and apply the collection as the dataProvider to a List.
3. Filter the collection so that all items are removed.
4. Filter the collection so that items are added again.
Actual Results: The list shows the items without any selection.
Expected Results: Due to 'requireSelection' being set to 'true', if the List displays items, one should be selected.
Workaround (if any): This is due to 'requireSelection' only being applied once in commitProperties after it is set.
commitProperties lines 907-920
if (requireSelectionChanged)
{
requireSelectionChanged = false;
if (requireSelection &&
selectedIndex == NO_SELECTION &&
dataProvider &&
dataProvider.length > 0)
{ // Set the proposed selected index here to make sure // commitSelection() is called below. _proposedSelectedIndex = 0; }
}
When a collection is reset or refreshed the 'requiredSelection' property should be checked and if true 'requireSelectionChanged' should be set to 'true' so that selection is forced again in commitProperties.
