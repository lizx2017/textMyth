Expected Results:
No RTE and recording should happen
Workaround (if any):
user needs to provide label to form item at least the empty label (i.e at least one space)
i.e for the currency valuator sample, user needs to make the following change (till the issue is fixed).
<mx:FormItem label=" ">
mx:Button id="myButton" label="Validate" click="
{updateLabel()}
"/>
</mx:FormItem>
