Summary:
Spark DataGrid performance extremely decreased since "gridView" is introduced.
Description:
Since there is gridView appeared in DataGridSkin the performance of the component is extremely decreased. By performance I mean update display list operations. At the moment the overall performance depends on data provider size, but this is contrary to the principle of the DataGrid when you can display huge amount of data with limited amount of item renderers instances.
How to reproduce:
Create s:DataGrid with a few columns, generate dataProvider with objects corresponging to the columns. For ~500 objects you will already see visible rendering lugs, just move your mouse over the grid or try to scroll. For ~2000 objects DataGrid becomes totally unusable.
This behaviour can be reproduced in 4.11-4.13 flex SDK versions, while in 4.5.1 and even in 4.9.1 everything is Okey.
