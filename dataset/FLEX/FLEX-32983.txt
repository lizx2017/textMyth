Summary:
ADL stops responding/ crashes when datagrid/Tree's dataProvider objects reads a read-only property from a private var, set during object construction
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Attached is the sample project implementing the problem
2. Check "Connect ADG", click "Initialize" and then expand the root node in the AdvancedDataGrid.
Note:
See data.TUidRecord for the source of adl.exe's trouble. MX Tree causes a freeze but does not crash adl. MX AdvancedDataGrid causes a crash in adl most of the time.
This example contains code extracted from a large custom library; as such expect oddities (e.g functionality, methods) that don't seem to have a logical purpose.
This bug was logged on Flash Runtime team. But their investigation shows that it is an SDK problem.
