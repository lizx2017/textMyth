Summary:
Types passed by reference should not be stored on the prototype because they are shared by all instances
Description:
Try the following ActionScript:
class Example
{
public var prop:Object = {};
}
var obj:Example = new Example();
obj.prop.value = 5;
var obj2:Example = new Example();
trace(obj2.prop.value); //5
The emitter puts the prop member on the prototype, so it is shared by all instances of Example:
Example.prototype.prop = {};
Instead, the emitter should set the property in Example's constructor so that each instance has a separate object. Maybe something like this:
public function Example()
{
this.prop = {};
super();
}
There is a workaround. A developer can manually set the property in the constructor, basically using the same code as above:
class Example
{
public function Example()
{
this.prop = {};
}
public var prop:Object;
}
