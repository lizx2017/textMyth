Summary:
use of "labelPosition" style of ColumnSeries in a CartesianChart throws exception
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. place a ColumnSeries within a CartesianChart - this is likely when creating multiple-series charts
2. set the "labelPosition" style of the ColumnSeries to "outside"
3.
Actual Results:
a coercion error is thrown on chart generation
Expected Results:
Workaround (if any):
line 1299 in ColumnSeries.as assumes the parent chart is of type ColumnChart
workaround is to 1) not use the "labelPosition" style 2) extend ColumnSeries, override updateTransform() with an exception handler around the call to super.updateTransform()
