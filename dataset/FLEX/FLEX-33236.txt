Summary:
Calling automationManager2.getChildren() on Spark DataGrid causes memory leak
Description:
To reproduce:
1. Import attached project to Flash Builder and run in Profile mode.
2. Let the application load in browser and click "getAutomationChildrenArray" button.
3. Watch how on every attempt to get children the total memory shown in flash Builder Profiler view grows and never goes down.
The problem can be also seen clearly without profiler. Just watch "iexplore.exe" process memory consumption in Task Manager.
The problem only occurs if there are item renderers that are not visible.
Possibly caused by GridColumnHeaderGroupLayout/getHeaderRendererAt() creating item renderer at line 597 via call to allocateVisualElement and never releasing it.
