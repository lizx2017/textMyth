RTE for Chart display when using labels, 100% height and ViewStates
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Compile attached minimal application. Enter "Chart" tab and press "Show chart" button.
2. An unexpected exception is raised when the chart is displayed:
TypeError: Error #1009: Cannot access a property or method of a null object reference.

3. By setting the height of the chart (or any of its parent containers) to a fixed value instead of 100%, the error does not appear
4. The error does not appear if the "AddChild" of the top level ViewState is replaced by a normal child (no states)
Actual Results:
Exception is raised!
Expected Results:
Chart should be shown without problems.
Workaround (if any):
If the "title" property of the LinearAxis is not set initially, the error is not raised.
