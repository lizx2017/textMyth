Summary:
Flex SDK 4.5 is removing deprecated methods creating incompatibilities
Description:
Flex SDK 4.5 is removing deprecated methods creating incompatibilities. I thought a good practice in Software was that only major releases should remove methods not dot releases.
ChartBase.dataToLocal() has been removed. Some others might have been as well.
That means applications (or components) that compiles against 4.0 and 4.1 can't compile against 4.5.
