Summary:
Sorting in the Advanced DataGrid is incorrect when only one column is sorted in descending order
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create an application containing one advanced data grid with atleast two columns (Column A and Column B) (Keep all the default properties of the AdvancedDataGrid)
2. Assign a DataProvider with 3-4 rows
3. Click on the header of Column A - Column A will sort ascending
4. Click on the sort icon on 'Column A' - Column A will now be sorted descending
5. Now Click on the Header (Text part) on Column A
Actual Results:
The sorting remains unchanged (Column A as Descending)
Expected Results:
The dataGrid must sort by 'column A' as ascending.
Please note that, on mouseOver on the text part of the header, the sort icon indicates that it is going to make the sort as Ascending.
