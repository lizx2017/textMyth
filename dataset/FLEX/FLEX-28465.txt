Summary:
View, whose destruction policy set to never, gets truncated on orientation. Happens when we return back from another view.
Description:
(copied from originally logged Runtime Bug)
The problem occurs in the following common scenario -
There is View1, whose destructionPolicy is set to "never" . The orientation works perfectly fine (View1 occupies complete area) when you are just in view1
View1 loads (pushes) another view View2. Now, When we return back to View1 from View2,
the orientation causes View1 view to get truncated.
I am attaching a sample app which provides a POC. (ViewTruncate.fxp). View1 and View2 just has a Rect each, whose size is specified in percentages.
The autoOrient is set to True in app XML.
Method:
1.Build and Launch the sample app.
2. click on the "click me to go to next view" text - this will take you to second view.
3. click on the "click me go to previous view" text - this will take to the previous view (first one)
4. orient the device or (in case testing on the adl on desktop - Menu -> Back)
Result:
The first view is truncated. the view doesnt occupy the entire area.
Expected:
The view should occupy the entire available area.
Workaround:
The workaround is to listen for the "orientationChanging" event on the stage at a higher priority than the application, and stop the immediate propagation of it when not on an iOS device. Example attached to Runtime bug.
