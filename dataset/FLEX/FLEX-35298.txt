Summary:
Two-way binding is not working with -> @
Description:
In current version of FlexJS there is only one way to make Two-way binding by using tag: <fx:Binding/>.
<js:model>
        <vo:Book id="book"/>
    </js:model>
    <js:beads>
        <js:VerticalLayout />
        <js:ContainerDataBinding />
    </js:beads>
    <fx:Binding source="txtInput1.text" destination="book.title" twoWay="true"/>
    <js:TextInput id="txtInput1" />
    <js:Label text="{book.title}"/>
Doing binding as it was in old Flex SDK by "@" is not working.
<js:model>
        <vo:Book id="book"/>
    </js:model>
    <js:beads>
        <js:VerticalLayout />
        <js:ContainerDataBinding />
    </js:beads>
    <js:TextInput id="txtInput1" text="@{book.title}"/>
It would be great to have this feature in our framework cause it simplify code, a lot.
I'm attaching example project with both option if someone would like to take a look into that.
