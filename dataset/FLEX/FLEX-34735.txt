Summary:
Spark CurrencyFormatter incorrectly formats 0 on iPad
Description:
Formatting a zero currency value with spark.formatters.CurrencyFormatter and the en_US locale works correctly on all platforms I've tried but not on iPad - instead of 0.00 it returns 0 (no decimals). Other number values without fractional parts format correctly (i.e., 78.00)
I've tried forcing fractionalDigits=2 and trailingZeros=true, no change.
This actually is an issue with flash.globalization.CurrencyFormatter - I traced through the code and the Spark formatter is just returning the result from the lower-level formatter. I tried to submit a bug with Adobe, but was not successful.
[The MX CurrencyFormatter works correctly, but I'd rather not roll back...]
