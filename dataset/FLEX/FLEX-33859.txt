Summary:
QTP11 with Flex Plugin 4.5 causes IE9 to crash
Description:
QTP 11.0 is started with Flex plugin 4.5 and Web addin. Our application is compiled with Flex automation libraries, runs within IE9, and on Windows 7.
When we use the Object Spy or learn an object via the Object Repository, IE crashes and freezes up the system, and we are forced to restart the machine. We can record/replay scripts without any problems. We can also replay existing automation scripts.
Additional background info....we have been using QTP 9.5, Flex Plugin 3.0, IE8 on a WinXP machine for the last couple years. We ran into a few issues initially, but worked them out, and automation scripts have been running successfully since.
But since our upgrade to Win7, QTP, & Flex Plugin, we have been running into this problem.
Current workarounds:
1) if we run an existing script or record/replay a new script, then we can use Object Spy and learn objects through Obj Repository without IE crashing. However, if we refresh IE (reload the app), and try to use Object Spy, then IE will crash.
2) In FlexPluginLogConfigFile.cfg file, if we set LOG_ENABLING to 1, which enables logging, then the issue no longer occurs. But the log file grows quickly when replaying or recording tests.
This appears to be a defect since the hooking mechanism used to point on objects is missing something when using Object Spy or Object Repository, and only re-enabled after recording/replay or with the logging file enabled.
Could not verify against Adobe's FlexStore (http://examples.adobe.com/flex2/inproduct/lcds/flexstore/flexstore.html) since the app is no longer available....wish Adobe never got rid of the FlexStore, but that's another issue.
Same issue was reported in FLEX-30453 ticket, but it was closed with the resolution that IE9 is not supported for QTP automation. And FLEXENT-1472, referenced below, is no longer available.

However, according Adobe's compatibility matrix
(http://blogs.adobe.com/vikaschandran/2010/07/10/compatibility-matrix-for-flex-qtp-plugin-3-0-0-and-4-0-0-for-qtp-and-ie-combinations/)
IE9 is supported using QTP11 and Flex plug-in 4.6
Please let me know if Adobe/Apache is aware of this issue, and when there will be a fix for it.
Thank you
