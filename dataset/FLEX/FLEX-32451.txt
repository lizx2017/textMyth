Summary:
Embedded fonts don't draw when linking frameworks as Runtime Shared Library (RSL)
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a chart and assign an embedded font to the chart.
2. Set the framework linking to link as merged into code.
3. Run the app. Axis labels will draw fine.
4. Set the framework linking to link as Runtime Shared Library
5. Run the app. Axis labels will not draw.
Workaround (if any):
No workaround found. Similar to bug FLEXDMV-1883 which was marked as fixed, but when sample project for that bug is run with framework linking set to RSL, the axis labels don't draw.
This is a huge problem for me as I'm trying to get a client to convert from Java applets to Flex. Without framework linking as RSLs, even simple apps are huge in size.
