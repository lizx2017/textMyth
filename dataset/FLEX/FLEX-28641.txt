Summary:
<fx:Date fullYear="2011" month="1" date="1"... and <mx:Date fullYear="2011" month="1" date="1"... set to "month + 1" if and only if today's date does not exist in that particular month.
Description:
Problem:
<fx:Date fullYear="2011" month="1" date="1"... and <mx:Date fullYear="2011" month="1" date="1"... are set to "month + 1" if and only if today's date does not exist in that particular month. For example, if today's date is 7/31/2011, and <fx:Date fullYear="2011" month="5" date="1"... would be 7/1/2011. And if today's date is 7/31/2011, and <fx:Date fullYear="2011" month="1" date="1"... would be 3/1/2011.
I found that the symptom is depend on the Time Zone because it is using UTC inside. Anyway, anyhow, if you change the Time Zone to GMT+9 Tokyo, and set to 7/31/2011, you will see the issue.
If you set the time to EST, change the date to 7/30/2011, then you will see June will be May. So the symptom is different in Time Zone.
If you don't reproduce the issue even with 7/31/2011 and GMT+9 Tokyo, please let me know. This is a very important issue because time is screwed.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Make sure you change your own OS date to 7/31/2011. (On EST, change the OS date to 7/30/2011.)
2. Run fxDateTest.mxml in debug mode
Actual Results:
<fx:Date fullYear="2011" month="1" date="1"...
The above set to March
<fx:Date fullYear="2011" month="5" date="1"...
The above set to July
Expected Results:
month="1", so it should be February.
month="5", so it should be June.
