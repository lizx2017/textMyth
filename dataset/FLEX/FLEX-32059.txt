Summary:
Changing the dataProvider using HierarchicalData is not always reflected in the AdvancedDataGrid
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run the attached sample (you should see 3 rows with data)
2. Click on "Data 2" (you should see 2 rows with data)
3. Click on "Original" (you only see 2 rows with data)
Actual Results:
The data displayed in the ADG is not the original data.
Expected Results:
The data displayed in the ADG should be the orginal data.
Workaround (if any):
Use as the data provider type an ArrayCollection instead of the HierarchicalData.
