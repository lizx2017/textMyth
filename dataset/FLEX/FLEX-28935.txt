Summary:
DateTimeFormatterEx.getAmPmPattern() null check required in DateSpinner
Description:
Globalization team (Harish) pointed out that erroneous pattern data could lead to DateTimeFormatterEx.getAmPmPattern() returning null. In the very low probability chance that this occurs, DateSpinner.as line 1229 will raise an RTE:
dateTimeFormatter.dateTimePattern = dateTimeFormatterEx.getAmPmPattern();
This assignment should be protected with a null check.
