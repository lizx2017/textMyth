Summary:
Incorrect keyboard when restricting input on TextInput
Description:
Flex 4.6.0
I have only tested this with TextInput on the iPad but suspect the problem will occur on other tablets with all flex components that allow the input of text.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a TextInput and restrict the text to numeric characters only.
2. Compile and run the app on a tablet device.
Actual Results: When given focus the tablets keyboard shows the default keyboard (alphabet) which doesn't contain a character that can be entered into the field.
Expected Results: The keyboard that contains characters that can be entered should be shown by default as with native iPad apps. Showing a keyboard that doesn't contain any characters that can be entered by the user is confusing.
