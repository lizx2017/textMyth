Summary:
Chart dataTip shown on the wrong place when device DPI is different than the applicationDPI
Description:
If I set applicationDPI for the Application, the chart dataTip is shown on wrong place for devices with a different DPI than the applicationDPI set.
For example: I set applicationDPI="240". When I run on a device with 163 DPI the Chart DataTip is shown far from the bar and for the the columns close to the right edge the dataTip is shown off the screen. This do not happen when I run on a device with 240 dpi.
Steps to reproduce:
1. create a mobile flex project
2. add in a column chart which fills the available area
3. set applicationDPI to 240
3. run the app simulating iPhone 3GS which is 163 DPI
4. tap and hold any colum bar
PS: Attached a test case project.
Actual Results:
DataTips are shown at the wrong place and for the columns close to the right edge, the dataTip is shown off the screen.
Expected Results:
DataTip should be shown inside the screen and close to the touched bar.
