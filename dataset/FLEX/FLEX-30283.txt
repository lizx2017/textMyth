Summary:
[Mosaic] QTP Object spy doesn't see LIveCycle Mosaic Login page Flex components
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Start QTP and set your Automation>Record and Run settings>Open the following address whan a record or run session begins: http://mdk-win7x64.corp.adobe.com:8080/mosaic/#/applications/Basic
2. Choose File>Create New Test...
3. When the Mosaic login screen appears in your browser, put you insertion point inside one of the username/password test fields. You should notice that QTP logged the event and that it recognizes the object as a FlexTextArea
4. Now select Insert>Checkpoint>Standard Checkpoint: and select the text area.
5. In the Object Selection - Checkpoint Properties you do not get the text area. Instead you get the WebElement: WebViewer as the object selected.
Actual Results:
Expected Results: The user wants the object spy to select and show the properties of the username/password text fields.
Workaround (if any): You can work around this by stopping the recording and going into the Expert View in QTP, inserting your insertion point at the end of the line that was created when you put your insertion point inside the textfield and inserting a standard checkpoint.
