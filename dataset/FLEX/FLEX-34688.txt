Summary:
New Android skin does not work at all with Flex Mobile libraries
Description:
I tested the new Apache Flex 4.14.0 mobile skins successful with a test project.
Now, I tried to apply in a real application and I never use flex mobile directly from the Flex framework. Instead I use a Flex Mobile Library to extend all Flex mobile components that I need (to customize if needed).
What I saw is that if I use a flex mobile component directly from the Apache Flex framework, then the new Android skin is successfully applied but if I use directly from a flex mobile library (and this mobile library directly from the Apache Flex), then, is applied the older skin in AIR simulator but also in a real Android device (I already checked the library to use the new Apache Flex 4.14.0 but this didn't solved the problem).
