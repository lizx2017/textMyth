Summary:
headerRelease event for AdvancedDataGrid does not set multiColumnSort event property correctly.
Description:
Steps to reproduce: (see attached files)
1. Create an ADG, set sortExpertMode="false" and add event listener for headerRelease.
2. Click a column to sort
3. Display the event from within the headerRelease event listener. See that multiColumnSort property is false. This is correct.
4. Move mouse over column headers in a new, non-sorted column, and position in sort-arrow area. This should show a '2' and the arrow. Click the mouse.
5. Display the event from within the headerRelease event listener. See that multiColumnSort property is false. This is incorrect - should be true.
Actual Results:
When sorting multiple columns, the event's multiColumnSort property is false.
Expected Results:
When sorting multiple columns, the event's multiColumnSort property should be true when clicking the additional sort button/arrow ('2', '3', etc). This way you can tell if the user is trying to add columns to the sort.
Note: When sortExpertMode is false AND ctrl+click is used to select a column header, the event's multiColumnSort property is also false when it should be true.
Workaround (if any):
none since you cannot tell what the user intends - to clear the sort or add columns to the sort.
