Summary:
Stack trace when moving a child from spark container to mx container
Description:
This generates a stack trace:
var hgroup:HGroup = new HGroup;
var hbox:HBox = new HBox;
var label:Label = new Label;
hgroup.addElement(label);
hbox.addChild(label);
Expected behavior:
It should not generate a stack trace.
Workaround:
Call removeElement on the spark container before calling addChild on the mx container.
