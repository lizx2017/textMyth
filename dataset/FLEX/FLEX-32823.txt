Summary:
AdvancedDataGrid.treeColumn not cleared when changing the columns property.
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a array of hierarchical data to serve as the dataProvider.
2. Create a array of columns with the first column being type AdvancedDataGridGroupItemRenderer.
3. Create a array of flat data, array of objects with no parent or children properties.
4. Create array of columns with all of the item renderers being type AdvancedDataGridItemRenderer.
ex.
dataProvider1 – XML or a HierachicalCollectionView
columnGroup1 – name column has itemRenderer="CustomNameGroupItemRenderer"
dataProvider2 – Array of Date Objects.
columnGroup2 – name column has itemRenderer="DifferentNameItemRenderer"
Actual Results:
The treeColumn property does not get cleared. In this case, when the second group of columns and data is applied to AdvancedDataGrid, the GroupItemRenderer is always used even if there isn't a column in the array of columns using a GroupItemRenderer.
Expected Results:
The tree column should be nulled out, and the appropriate item renderer used.
Workaround (if any):
When columns is set on the AdvancedDataGrid, null the treeColumn property.
