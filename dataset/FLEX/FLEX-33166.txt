Summary:
Mobile TextInput with native StageTextInput cannot be included in scrollable forms
Description:
We should be able to configure a text field which only accepts numerical input to call up the numeric pad. However, the skinclasses for the textfield that can call up the number pad will not scroll--If you try to use the skinclass that can call the softkey number pad in a scrollable container, the textfield scrolls away from its text.
