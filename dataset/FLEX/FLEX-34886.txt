Summary:
BlazeDS 4.7.0 incompatible replacement for BlazeDS 4.6
Description:
I've recently noticed that Apache BlazeDS 4.7.0 has become available and have attempted to migrate a project currently using Adobe BlazeDS 4.6.
Although the release notes state that there are no changes from Adobe BlazeDS 4.6 there seems to be some significant differences. I am encountering an exception related to the messaging system:
java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: javax/jms/InvalidSelectorException
at flex.messaging.services.MessageService.testSelector(MessageService.java:1182) ~[flex-messaging-core-4.7.0.jar:4.7.0]
at flex.messaging.services.MessageService.manageSubscriptions(MessageService.java:930) ~[flex-messaging-core-4.7.0.jar:4.7.0]
at flex.messaging.services.MessageService.serviceCommand(MessageService.java:339) ~[flex-messaging-core-4.7.0.jar:4.7.0]
at flex.messaging.MessageBroker.routeCommandToService(MessageBroker.java:1573) ~[flex-messaging-core-4.7.0.jar:4.7.0]
at flex.messaging.endpoints.AbstractEndpoint.serviceMessage(AbstractEndpoint.java:1016) ~[flex-messaging-core-4.7.0.jar:4.7.0]
...
The exception seems to be getting thrown from the "testSelector" method on line 1182 in flex.messaging.services.MessageService.java when it tries to instantiate a new flex.messaging.services.messaging.selector.JMSSelector
I've noticed that the JMSSelector class has dependencies on org.apache.activemq in BlazeDS 4.7.0 where as the version in 4.6 did not. These dependencies are missing from my project which is probably why I get an exception, they must be an optional dependency of BlazeDS.
Does the Apache Flex team have any idea which verison BlazeDS 4.7.0 was built on top of when it came from Adobe? The Original BlazeDS 4.6 nightly builds are still around: http://sourceforge.net/adobe/blazeds/wiki/download%20blazeds%20trunk/
