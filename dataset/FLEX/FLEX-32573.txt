Summary:
Flex Builder 3.0.2 cannot find data visualization source code in 3.4 SDK
Description:
Expected source paths have changed in SDK 3.4 for datavisualizations:
Flex Builder 3.0.2 expects ${PROJECT_FRAMEWORKS}\fbpro\projects\datavisualization\src
the new sdk layout puts the source in ${PROJECT_FRAMEWORKS}\frameworks\projects\datavisualisation\src
Steps to reproduce:
1. Download / extract Flex SDK 3.4 into
{Flex Builder Plugin install directory}/sdks/3.4.0
2. Download / extract Flex Data Visualization Component SDK 3.4 into {Flex Builder Plugin install directory}
/sdks/3.4.0
3. Open flex builder, add new sdk (Window->Preferences->Flex->Installed Flex SDKs->Add, Choose
{Flex Builder Plugin install directory}
/sdks/3.4.0), Set as default.
4. Create new Flex project, add an advanceddatagrid mxml tag.
5. Control+Click the advanced data grid tag.
Actual Results:
"Code Navigator Error: Source could not be found for mx.controls.AdvancedDataGrid in C:\Program Files\Adobe\Flex Builder 3 Plugin\sdks\3.4.0\frameworks\libs\datavisualization.swc."
Expected Results:
Source to be found and displayed
Workaround (if any):
Change the source entry path for datavisualization.swc:
1. Project -> Properties -> Flex Build Path
2. Choose Library Path tab, expand Flex 3.4, expand the datavisualizations.swc file, double click it's source attachment
3. Change the source path to ${PROJECT_FRAMEWORKS}/projects/datavisualisation/src
