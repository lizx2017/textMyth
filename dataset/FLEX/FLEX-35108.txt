Summary:
acceptDragDrop fails drop on parent when child component visited first
Description:
The problem happens only within AIR. The same application running in a browser works correctly. The problem could be within the AIR native drag implementation, which would require Adobe to fix.
I have filed a bug in the Adobe bugbase:
https://bugbase.adobe.com/index.cfm?event=selectBug&CFGRIDKEY=4170354
I have attached my test case and videos which show the same routine having different behavior in AIR as compared with Web.
