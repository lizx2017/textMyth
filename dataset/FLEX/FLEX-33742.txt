Summary:
CalloutButtons inside another CalloutButton or Callout opened contents closeDropDown calls close the parent callout content
Description:
When using a callout button inside the callout content of a different callout button I am having an undesired effect.
Calling the dropdown method of the child callout button (the one placed at the callout content) is closing its callout content (as desired) but also closing the parents callout content.
CalloutButton instances are to be closed using the closeDropDown() method which is causing the problem. Calling it for one instance is closing all instances. I think it was programmed that way thinking there would never be 2 CalloutButton instances opened at a time, but It really happens when you use CalloutButtons inside the contents that are displayed when an instance of CalloutButton is opened.
