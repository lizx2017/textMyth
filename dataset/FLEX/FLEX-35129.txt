Summary:
[FlexJS] Flash Builder Component Dialog Box - Based On Not Working
Description:
The default based on is mx.containers.Canvas, which gives a message saying the the base component class does not exist. Browsing for a new component doesn't yield any result, rendering the dialog useless.
Workaround: copy a file from the examples, using it as a template, and edit it in flashbuilder.
