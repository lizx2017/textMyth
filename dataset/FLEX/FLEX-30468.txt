Summary:
return missing in function getAutomationChildAt of file SparkVideoPlayerAutomationImpl.as
Description:
I am creating a testing tool for flex and discover during my tests that the function getAutomationChildAt in file SparkVideoPlayerAutomationImpl.as always return null.
I look at the source code and verify that the function is missing a return and should be :
override public function getAutomationChildAt(index:int):IAutomationObject
{ var arr:Array = getAutomationChildren(); if (arr && (arr.length < index)) return arr[index]; return null; }
I would need a new automation_spark.swc library for validate my tool. Could you tell me how I can recompile the library.
