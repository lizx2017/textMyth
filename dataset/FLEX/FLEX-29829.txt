Summary:
QTP is stopping after 30 records in Flex 3 SDK complaining 'you don't have license'.
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. I have installed Flex Builder 3 trial software initially. Once I got the license I added license number in manage license window in Flex.
2. I have configured all necessary configurations for Flex application to work with QTP
3. I started recording Flex application from QTP
Actual Results:
It has recorded all events up to 30. After 30 records, it gave me a pop up window saying, " You need to have a licensed version of Flex"
Expected Results:
I have a licensed version of Flex 3. I am using Flex 3 Professional lincense. I am using Advanced Data Grid features in my Flex applications. This is the confrimation that I have Flex 3 professional version.
Workaround (if any):
I tried so many scenarios but not working. I don't understand why QTP stops recording after 30 events though I have Professional Adobe Flex 3 version software installed on my machine.
