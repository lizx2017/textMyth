Summary:
ErrorSkin doesn't draw correctly
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Add a button with cornerRadius=10
2. Change the style errorSkin to spark.skins.FocusSkin and set the focusfocusThickness=6 (or do your own, the goal here is to increase the glowEffect)
3. Assign a errorString to the button twice
Actual Results:
The errorSkin don't show correctly
Expected Results:
Workaround (if any):
The problem is that if the errorSkin is already draw and visible, the second Time it will be in the displayList when the bitmap will be draw.
To correct it :
In the ErrorSkin before the super.updateDisplayList set the visible property to false then turn it on :
this.visible = false;
super.updateDisplayList(unscaledWidth, unscaledHeight);
this.visible = true;
