Summary:
HTML/PDF width exceeds AIR application window width
Description:
I'm using running Acrobat Reader 10.1.1. Run the attached FXP and click the button to display the PDF. Once it appears, notice how the width of the HTML content exceeds the application window width and there's no scroll bar in the HTML control.
The workaround is to resize the window every time a PDF is loaded. This refreshes the HTML control and adjusts the content accordingly.
This issue does not occur in Flex 4.5.1 and AIR 2.7.1. As a result, we cannot use any newer versions of Flex/AIR.
