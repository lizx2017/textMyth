Summary:
Incorrect if statement in mx.charts.CategoryAxis::update()
Description:
This is a pure code issue - we stumbled across it while debugging another problem.
Line 936 in mx.charts.CategoryAxis (update() method) has the following if-statement:
if (!_categoryValues[i])
continue;
This produces incorrect results if _categoryValues[i] == 0 - in which case the if-statement will trigger inappropriately, since the value 0 (zero) evaluates to false.
The code should read:
if(_categoryValues[i] == null)
continue;
The if-statement was actually coded correctly a few lines up in another code block (line 920 of the same class), so this must have been an oversight.
