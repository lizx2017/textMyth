Summary:
Propagation of Escape key in mx.controls.DateField should only be stopped if the DropDown is shown
Description:
DateField's keyDownHandler() stops propagation of the Escape key only if it is not editable, but this should only be done if the dropDown is shown, so the parent container gets a chance to handle the Escape key.
Proposed solution:
...
else if (event.keyCode == Keyboard.ESCAPE)
{
if (showingDropdown)
{ selectedDate = lastSelectedDate; displayDropdown(false, event); event.stopPropagation(); }
}
