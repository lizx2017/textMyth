Summary:
VideoDisplay cleanUpSource() throws error if previous source was bad
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1.Set source to a broken URL
2.Change the source and try to play
Actual Results:
VideoDisplay class throws an error on method cleanUpSource() lines 1956 and 1966.
Expected Results:
Should play.
Workaround (if any):
Monkey-patching the class to have cleanUpSource() method look like cancelLoadAndPlay() (above it) meaning that those lines (1956 and 1966) should be : 'if (videoPlayer.displayObject) videoPlayer.displayObject.visible = true;'.
