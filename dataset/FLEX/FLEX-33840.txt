Summary:
Spark DataGrid calculateDropLocation returns 1 with an empty dataProvider
Description:
Try to drop an item to a spark:DataGrid witch has no data (empty dataProvider). The application throws an error (out of range 1)
This happens because the calculation for the dropIndex is false
(returns 1 - should be 0)
It seems that this happens because the Grid Skin returns also 1 for his numElements property .
(see grid.layout.calculateDropLocation(event) in the DataGrids calculateDropLocation)
