Summary:
Vector.pop return value is not strongly typed
Description:
Consider we have the following code:
function g(item:Sound):void {}
function f():void {
var v:Vector.<Sprite> = new Vector.<Sprite>();
v.push(new Sprite());
f(v.pop());
}
Here "v.pop()" type is clearly documented as T=Sprite, as in http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/Vector.html#pop()
But mxmlc doesn't complain about implicit type coercion.
Actual Results:
Runtime Coercion error
Expected Results:
Compile-time type check error
