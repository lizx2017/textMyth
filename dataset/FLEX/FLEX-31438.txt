Summary:
AdvancedDataGrid column header renderers cropped by sort arrow drawing, even when sort arrow isn't there
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create an AdvancedDataGrid with columns whose names take up the full column header (or more).
Actual Results:
– Column header names are cropped (they do not go into the sort arrow area, even when not sorting on that column)
– AdvancedDataGridEvents, such as HEADER_RELEASE, are not being fired when the event target is the sort arrow.
Due to the latter problem, I am logging the bug as "Incorrectly Functioning" and not as a "Cosmetic Issue".
Expected Results:
– Column header names should not be cropped by sort arrow area when not sorting on that column (DataGrid behavior)
– MouseEvents on sort arrow area are treated as MouseEvents on column header (DataGrid behavior)
