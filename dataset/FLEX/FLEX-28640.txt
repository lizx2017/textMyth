Summary:
Spark ToolTipManager Needs to Loosen its API to Accept IToolTipManagerClients Instead of UIComponents
Description:
Spark ToolTipManager uses registerToolTip(UIComponent). This should be changed to registerToolTip(mx.managers.IToolTipManagerClient). IToolTipManagerClient should be expanded to include the toolTipData property. MX and Spark components not extending UIComponent (mostly TextField related components) need to have a toolTipData property added.
This was initiated by the tool tip needs of DefaultDataGridItemRenderer, which is not a UIComponent.
