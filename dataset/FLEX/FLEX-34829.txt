This issue needs to be re-signed apk to resolve.
But added a lot of development work;
So we hope to get a clear fix to flex development apk, how can a reasonable solution keystore problems;
The steps we resolve as follows:
1) Change the extension of your .apk to .zip
2) Open and remove the folder META-INF
3) Change the extension to .apk
4) Use the jarsigner and zipalign with your new keystore.
5) keytool -genkey -alias new.keystore -keyalg RSA -validity 20000 -keystore new.keystore
6) jarsigner -verbose -keystore new.keystore -signedjar signed.apk -digestalg SHA1 -sigalg SHA1withRSA un-signed.apk new.keystore
