Summary:
"Explode effect" on PieChart is missing
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
Just download the adobe dashboard sample from http://examples.adobe.com/flex2/inproduct/sdk/dashboard/srcview/index.html.
And try to compile it with Flex Builder 3 Beta 2 (Flex3 M3 (Beta 2) compiler). And you shall see that when the pie chart is exploading no effect is plaing, but it should like it was with Flex Moxie M2 (and it does if it is compiled with this compiler).
Actual Results:
No visual effect while exploading.
