Summary:
List scroll position doesn't animate smoothly when scroll snapping is used with resizeable itemrenderers
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Open attached file (a list with animated IR resize on selection AND scrollsnapping turned on)
2. Works best if you run on device, but you can see some jitter on desktop, too
3. Click various items in the list towards the bottom of the scroller
Actual Results:
List jitter, odd scroll position behavior (such as only showing part of the selected item)
Expected Results:
smooth animation, list scrolls smoothly to the bottom of the selected item after its animation completes
