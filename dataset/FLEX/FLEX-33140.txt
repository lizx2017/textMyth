Summary:
id attricute in <a> tag converts to lowercase when using TextConverter.importToFlow with TEXT_FIELD_HTML_FORMAT
Description:
var text:String = "<a id='FOO'>bar</a>";
var flow:TextFlow = TextConverter.importToFlow(text, TextConverter.TEXT_FIELD_HTML_FORMAT);
flow.getElementByID("FOO") == null // true â€“ should be false but ID has been imported as "foo"
Note that importing via TextFlowUtil.importToString() doesn't have this issue (though the point here is to import an HTML-formatted string so TextFlowUtil is not an option since it expects TLF formatting). Also, the imported anchor element's 'href' attribute is not affected: it retains its casing as expected.
