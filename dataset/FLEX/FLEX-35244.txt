Summary:
Binding Problem when having multiple levels of binding where one of the elements is null
Description:
In FlexJSExample there is a binding in Line 110 of ProductDetails.mxml there is the following line:
<js:Label text="{cf.format(product.price)}" style="fontWeight:'bold'"/>
If product is null then the binding produces an error complaining that it can't get the value of the "price" property of a null value. I think our binding should not produce this error.
