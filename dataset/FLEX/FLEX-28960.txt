Summary:
Move components out of the mobile package and SWC
Description:
It gets asked over and over, "why can't I use these new components in a standard Flex or AIR project?"
The new components developed with mobile in mind are also useful for web and desktop applications. It is confusing to new comers how they can setup their project so that they can acess and use these components. The only components that should be in the mobile package are components that only work/are only useful for mobile.
Please remove the following list of classes from the mobile project and SWC and add them into the spark project and SWC.
spark.components.BusyIndicator
spark.components.CallOut
spark.components.CallOutButton
spark.components.CalloutPosition (shouldn't be in the components package at all IMO, it isn't a component, it should be in supportClasses at least)
spark.components.IconItemRenderer
spark.components.SpinnerList
spark.layouts.VerticalSpinnerLayout
spark.preloaders.SplashScreen
