Hi guys!
I am using Advanced Data Grid to display data. In my grid, I created a ItemRender and a image embed. I used two event to run some action.
1. Use itemClick on Advanced Data Grid.
2. Use click event on image (rendered on row).
When i clicking on Image to run an action and itemClick event also run as the same time.
How to distinct these event when user clicking on item row or image?
Thanks,
Jairis
