Summary:
mx:AdvancedDataGrid header column separators display embedded SWF on mouseover
Description:
The mx:AdvancedDataGrid control in Flex 4.9.1 is acting very oddly when the application has an embedded SWF. When a user mouses over the header column separators in the AdvancedDataGrid the SWF will display on top of the mouse cursor. A demonstration of this behavior can be found here: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/11780410/AdvDataGridBugTest/AdvDataGridBugTest.html
