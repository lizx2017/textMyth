Summary:
swfLoaded charts dataTips lose parent container boundaries; worked in 3.0 codebase, broken in 3.2
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. compile testHGWidget.mxml code;
2. modify swfLoader.source (line 59) in chartTesters.mxml to point to just compiled testHGWidget.swf
3. compile and run chartTesters.mxml
4. hover mouse over any wedge of either pie chart in the "Static/Hardcoded" Panel
5. hover mouse over any wedge of either pie chart in the "Dynamic/swfLoaded" Panel
Actual Results:
When hovering over a wedge in the statically created pie chart, the dataTips are positioned relative to the panel containers they are children of. However, on the swfLoaded one, the dataTips lose their parent containters somehow and the dataTips are shown relative to the stage.
Expected Results:
The dataTips of a swfLoaded pie chart should still retain the boundaries of its parent container (in this case, the panel that is loaded in the Dynamic/swfLoaded panel); This issue didn't appear until I update my flex codebase to 3.2 last week. Before that, the dataTips in the dynamically swfLoaded pie charts worked as expected.
