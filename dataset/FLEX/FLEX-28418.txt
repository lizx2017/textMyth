Summary:
Flex view transitions need to set opaqueBackground where possible. This provides a major boost on Android with 16bit rendering enabled.
Description:
Any moving element in a view transition that is opaque should have the opaqueBackground flag set. This lets the renderer skip an intermediate 32bit rendering stage used to compute alpha blends. This is a major performance gain on Android when the 16bit renderer is enabled, and especially on non-NEON devices. (XOOM view transisions go from about 30fps to about 44fps).
Please consult with Glenn on the finer points of the change.
