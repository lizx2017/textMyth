Summary:
Can not convert 17 digit Number to String
Description:
I am facing issue in Number to String Conversion. I am using flex 4.5 SDK
I have 17 digit numbers and when i try to convert in to string then it is not giving me proper result.
Var myNumber :Number = 64336512942563914;
Var myString:String = myNumber.toString();
trace("myString "+myString);
trace("myNumber "+myNumber);
//out put :
myString 64336512942563910
myNumber 64336512942563910
Its automatically converts 17th digit to "0" value
I have also tried type conversion(Srting(myNumber)) but no Luck same problem ,
Also tried directly displaying number in the trace() function same problem I am getting
Is this issue in the Flex Sting Class?
