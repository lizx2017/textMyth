Summary:
Focus indicator is off on the second row when tab is used to move
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run the attached test case "testcase.mxml"
2. Click on the cell "col03" on the first row
3. Hit "tab" several times so that it moves to the second row.
Actual Results:
When it moves to the second row, the focus indicator is off with one cell in this case.
Please see the attached screen capture "ADGFocus.jpg".
I blieve it is depend on the 'editable="false"'
Expected Results:
The focus indicator shouldn't be off even it is moved using "tab"
