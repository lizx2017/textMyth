Summary:
Adv. DataGrid column headers are rendered incorrectly when you use custom component as headerRenderer.
Description:
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the attached sample program in Flex Builder 3.
2. Execute the sample program.
3. Click the [sortExpertMode=false] button and check the appearance of the column headers.
4. Click the [sortExpertMode=true] button and check the appearance of the column headers.
Actual Result:
At the step #4, the custom components' size were larger than the column headers of the Grid as the attached 'Reproduced.gif'. (Symptom was reproduced.)
But, at the step #3, the custom components were shown as I expected as the attached 'NotReproduced.gif'.(Symptom was not reproduced.)
Expected Result:
The custom components' size were adjusted as same as the column headers of the Advanced DataGrid, no matter with the 'sortExpertMode' property value.
Workaround(if any)
None. I searched other methods to customize the colmun headers, but could not find them.
