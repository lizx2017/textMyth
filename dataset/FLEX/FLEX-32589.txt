Summary:
pendingCellSelection only cleared when setting selectedCells property
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. set selectedCells to include selections beyond visible grid cells e.g. select all cells by user clicking on button
2. using normal mouse click to select any cell in the grid.
Actual Results:
Although selectedCells are reset via a call to clearSelectedCells() , pendingCellSelection is not reset. If one now scrolls the grid to bring into view columns and rows which were included in the initial selection, they are visually highlighted as sellected and re-included in selectedCells.
i.e. clearPendingCells() is not called when a normal mouse selection is performed. It is only called from the selectedCells setter method.
Expected Results:
Whenever clearSelectedCells() is called, clearPendingCells() should alo be called, not just in selectedCells setter.
Suggested fix:
1. In clearSelectedCells() add call to clearPendingCells()
2. Remove call to clearPendingCells() from selectedCells setter
