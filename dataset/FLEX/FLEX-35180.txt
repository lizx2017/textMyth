Summary:
Allowed HTML in components
Description:
The way FlexJS deal with HTML is not standardized and not working properly. We need to make it work in general
From the thread in flexjs mailing list:
So anyway, what should work is in-line xhtml as the value of the html
property. IOW a plain text label should look like the following MXML:
<js:Button text="plain text label"/>
AFAIK, Button (and not js, only mdl) is the only control that allows "text" has default property, but others not... maybe text based controls should do this as well but not html. The example above works, and even you can declare as:
<mdl:Button>
plain text label
</mdl:Button>
For a simple html label, you should be able to do:
<js:Button text="this is an <b>html</b> label"/>
This is not allowed (I tried even including some CDATA around, but not compile with or without internal html tags
And this should also work, with or without [DefaultProperty]
<js:Button>
<js:html>
<h1>My Fancy Button</h1>
<p>With <span>this label</span></p>
<js:html>
<js:Button>
This not works but this is ok:
<mdl:Button>
<h1>My Fancy Button</h1>
</mdl:Button>
but only one tag as root, If append for example a <p> this will fail
