Summary:
jenkins slave H10 has problems checking out code from github
Description:
The job cloudstack-pr-analysis has regular failures that can not be explained by the code and happen during the checkout fase. Particular jenkins slave H10 has not had a succesful run in a while (example https://builds.apache.org/job/cloudstack-pr-analysis/820/console) Can you place clear the workspace on this client? Note that in the meanwhile several other slaves run fine. (see https://builds.apache.org/job/cloudstack-pr-analysis/)
