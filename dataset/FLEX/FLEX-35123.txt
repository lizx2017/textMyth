Summary:
DOM XSS vulnerability in history.js
Description:
Template file history.js contains a DOM XSS vulnerability. While it looks like it would be difficult to exploit, it should be addressed.
The code in question is in a block specific to ancient versions of Safari (<= 2.0.4), so I propose that block could safely be removed entirely.
The vulnerable line is:
getFormElement().innerHTML = '<form name="historyForm" action="'file'#' + flexAppUrl + '" method="GET"></form>';
The variables 'file' and 'flexAppUrl' are being passed unescaped into HTML subcontext.
I'm attaching a patch that would remove the Safari-specific handling, including the vulnerable line.
