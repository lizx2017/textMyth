Summary:
Automation not working for 2.0.1 swf loaded inside 3.0.0 swf
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Place a call to SystemManager.getSWFRoot() inside flex 2 app code for any control instance.
2. Run the versioning test app.
3. Place a break point on call.
Actual Results:
The return value is null.
This is because there seems to be two different lists of SystemManagers maintained when a Flex 2 app is loaded into a Flex 3 App.
Expected Results:
A SystemManager instance should have been returned.
