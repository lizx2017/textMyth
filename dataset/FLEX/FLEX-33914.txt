http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15187147/exception-logged-when-using-custom-css-in-javafx-in-felix-osgi
I the css files are not loaded properly. According to the post I can solve this problem by setting the JavaFX application to load text css files instead of binaty bss.
How I can set this value -Dbinary.css=false in a low level into the JavaFX application?
