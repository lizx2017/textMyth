Summary:
Accordion.selectedElement should be typed as AccordionContent, not IVisualElement
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Look at Accordion.selectedElement getter
Actual Results:
It's a IVisualElement
Expected Results:
It should be AccordionContent
Workaround (if any):
Cast it
An underlying assumption in Accordion is that its elements are always AccordionContents. IVisualElement is unnecessarily generic. Perhaps the method name should also be changed to selectedAccordionContent or selectedContent for clarity. The selectedElement name appears to be taken from ViewStack, but ViewStack is much more generic.
This change will require refactoring method names and removing AccordionContent casts throughout all of the Accordion files.
