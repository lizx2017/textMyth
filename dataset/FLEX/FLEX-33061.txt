Summary:
Flex SDK 4.5.1A font compile issue
Description:
In style sheet, declared embedAsCff = true, however when running the application still give me the warning
"warning: incompatible embedded font 'SegoeUI' specified for spark.components::Label (Label7) . This component requires that the embedded font be declared with embedAsCFF=true."
@font-face
{
embedAsCFF: true;
src:url(assets/SEGOEUI.TTF);
font-family: "SegoeUI";
font-weight: normal;
}
