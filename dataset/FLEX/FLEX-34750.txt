Summary:
BusyIndicatorSkin does not work with mx:Application
Description:
BusyIndicatorSkin is referring to the applicationDPI property, which is only available in spark.components.Application, but not in mx.core.Application.
Thus you cannot use BusyIndicator in mx:Application anymore, while it was working with 4.13.
