Summary:
LineSeries styles legendMarkerRenderer and itemRenderer are unable to be set in css
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
Create an application with a LineChart that has at least one LineSeries element. In a css file, copy the following code, which defines a legendMarkerRender in the css, instead of in mxml:
mx|LineSeries{
legendMarkerRenderer : ClassReference("mx.charts.renderers.CircleItemRenderer");
}
This also applies to the style itemRenderer in the LineSeries class as well. I have attached a test project as well that outlines the problem. To see the itemRenderer issue, uncomment the line in the default.css file.
Actual Results:
When the application runs, it displays the following error:
cannot convert mx.charts.renderers::CircleItemRenderer$ to mx.core.IFactory.
Expected Results:
The LineSeries class should accept a ClassReference from getStyle and handle the result appropriately.
