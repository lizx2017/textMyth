Summary:
ADG with HierarchicalData as the dataProvider and labelFunction on the columns dosen't call the sortCompareFunction
Description:
Source code attached
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create an AvancedDataGrid with a HierarchicalData as the data provider.
2. Define a labelFunction and a sortCompareFunction on the columns.
3. Run the application.
4 . Click on the header of any column you configured as shown on the step 2.
Actual Results:
The sortCompareFunction defined is not called.
Expected Results:
Call the defined sortCompareFunction
Workaround (if any):
Use the dataField instead of the labelFunction. But that's not an option for me.
