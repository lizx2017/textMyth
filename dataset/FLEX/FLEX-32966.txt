Summary:
ADG rowCount is not managed correctly, leading to items not showing, exceptions etc.
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run the attached demo. It only delayed-adds items to an ADG.
2. Click the button that calls ADG.invalidateDisplayList(); .
Actual Results:
All items seem to be removed.
The ADG.rowCount changes to 6, and later to 0.
Expected Results:
Items shown as before.
ADG.rowCount remains as set, at 8.
Workaround (if any):
None found. Since there's no event firing when rowCount changes, there's no place to set rowCount back to desired value covering all use-cases.
The fact that rowCount is somehow decreased by the height of the headers (8 -> 6) is a minor issue.
Additinal information:
The issue seems to be caused by "rendererChanged" not cleared properly (or rather, re-set during updateDisplayList).
It worked fine in 3.5.0.
