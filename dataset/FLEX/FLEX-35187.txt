Summary:
[FlexJS] 1px Left Offset Added to Containers
Description:
https://paste.apache.org/ogza
In the above app the two labels are not aligned on the Y axis. Each container adds a 1px offset.
This seems to come from the borderWidth set for the containers viewport but I'm not sure how to fix it.
Flash is not affected.
