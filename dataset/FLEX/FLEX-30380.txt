Summary:
Incorrect tabular data returned when item renderers show empty values
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a DataGrid with a column that uses custom item renderer.
2. In the item renderer set displayed label to empty string for some rows.
3. Get tabular data for the grid using "automationTabularData" property.
4. Tabular data returned for the cells where empty string was expected actually contain some data which seems to be a copy from other rows.
Actual Results:
Incorrect cell value returned in tabular data for empty cells.
Expected Results:
Empty string should be returned.
Workaround (if any):
None.
Attached is a sample application that demonstrates the problem. It is compiled with RIATest Agent. Inspect the DataGrid using "Inspect" feature and select "Tabular Data" tab. See how Tabular Data shows a value for second row, column "Login" whereas the actual Data Grid cell is empty.
