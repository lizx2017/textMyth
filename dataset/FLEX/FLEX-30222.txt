Summary:
[MUSTFIX}-input operation on a mx:Text with a embeded font-style is not recognized by QTP
Description:
Steps to replicate the issue
1) add few fonts to the src (for ex :src\assets\fonts). One of the fonts is Tahoma.ttf
2) create a file fonts.css and declare these fonts(@font-face)
@font-face {
src: url("/assets/fonts/tahoma.ttf");
font-family: tahoma;
font-style: normal;
font-weight: normal;
}
3) compile this css as a swf.
4) create an another css file for example say styles.css and embed this fonts as like mentioned below
@font-face {
src: url("../build/fonts.swf");
font-family: tahoma;
font-style: normal;
font-weight: normal;
}
5) create a style
.loginTextInput {
font-size : 30pt;
font-family: tahoma;
}
6)Compile this css also to a swf file
7) The in the application file load the swf style dynamically.
StyleManager.loadStyleDeclarations( "styles.swf" );
8) Also apply this style to a text file and when try to record input operation through QTP 9.2, it is not recognized. Only below operations are recognized and recorded
Browser("Browser").FlexApplication("sample").FlexTextArea("test").ChangeFocus
**Note : This issue persist only in dynamic loading. When it is statically loaded this issue no longer exist ie. loading styles like mentioned below
<mx:Style source="styles.css"/>
Not sure if i am missing anything.
