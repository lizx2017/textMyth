Summary:
DateSpinner and SpinnerList scrolling behavior inaccurate/broken
Description:
The scrolling behavior of the DateSpinner and SpinnerList is very inaccurate/broken and does not correctly snap to the nearest list entry after the user has finished scrolling. This happens in most of the use cases. In fact, the lists spin up or down approximately between 3 to 10 entries, depending on the scroll direction.
This seems to be an issue with the position of the entry under the selection indicator. Only if you scroll an entry in a way that it is placed at the very middle of the indicator and does not overlap the spinner does not automatically spin several items up or down.
You can use this example to see the inaccuracy/spinning afterwards after releasing in action:
