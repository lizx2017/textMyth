Summary:
Mac version of InstallApacheFlex should download the flex sdk binary as tar.gz
Description:
Right now, both the windows and mac versions download the .zip version of the binary kit. This is causing issues on Macs.
Carol:
"On the mac the scripts in the bin directory don't have their execute bit
set. I'm sure that is true for the other shell scripts in the tree as
well.
I suspect that is because I saw the Apache Flex zip kit being downloaded,
not the tar.gz kit."
