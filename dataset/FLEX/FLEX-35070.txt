Summary:
"for each" not working in XMLList
Description:
I don't have a full test case right now, but I believe the following will fail.
var newList:XMLList = new XMLList();
newList.appendChild(<foo/>);
var xmlItem:XML;
for each(xmlItem in oldList)
newList.appendChild(xmlItem);
If necessary, I can put together a (non)working test case.
