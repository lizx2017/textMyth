Summary:
Creating a pop up from a menubar or from within Firefox crashes
Description:
In PopUpManagerImpl line 460 we have
if (!localRoot)
localRoot = DisplayObjectContainer(parent.root);
This crashes if parent is null.
Happens when trying to open a pop up when a menu is still closing in Air (sometimes) or when called from firefox browser (always)
