Summary:
Web FTP connection issue
Description:
I am creating an web ftp example using flex 4.0, when i run the application from development environment (from flex) its connecting ftp server perfectly and working fine. But when trying to connect FTP server from release build version of application. Its not working.
What could be the possible reason to stop connecting FTP server from flex web ftp request?
On FTP connection request receive error:
Command socket error: [SecurityErrorEvent type="securityError" bubbles=false cancelable=false eventPhase=2 text="Error #2048: Security sandbox violation: http://localhost/YemoWebFTP/WebFTP.swf cannot load data from 10.0.2.197:21]
Also using crossdomain.xml as follow:
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE cross-domain-policy SYSTEM "/xml/dtds/cross-domain-policy.dtd">
<!-- Policy file for xmlsocket://socks.example.com -->
<cross-domain-policy>
<site-control permitted-cross-domain-policies="all"/>
<!-- Instead of setting to-ports="*",administrators can use ranges and commas -->
<allow-access-from domain="*" secure="true" to-ports="21,80, 843, 1024-3000" />
<allow-http-request-headers-from domain="" headers=""/>
</cross-domain-policy>
And from application before connection request to FTP server
Security.loadPolicyFile("http://10.0.2.197/crossdomain.xml");
Additionaly, also tried:
Security.allowDomain("*");
Security.loadPolicyFile("xmlsocket://10.0.2.197");
Thanks in advance.
