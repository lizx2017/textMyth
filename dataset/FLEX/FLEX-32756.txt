Summary:
Text overlapping across columns on AdvancedDataGrid when using HierarchicalData
Description:
I have enclosed a sample application that demonstrates the issue without having to go through the steps below.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create an AdvancedDataGrid and populate it with a HierarchicalData object. The HierarchicalData object must be quite deeply nested (in the example I enclosed, I have nested 11 times.
2. Expand all folders (you'll need to drag the head to the right to get at the lower folders). When they're all expanded, drag the column back to where it was.
3. Scroll up and down the scroll bar on the data grid and you'll see overlapping text.
Actual Results: Text overlaps on different columns - looks like a rendering issue.
Expected Results: Text should not overlap across columns.
Workaround (if any): None.
