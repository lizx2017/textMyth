Summary:
AdvancedDataGrid: TextInput focusOut event is not dispatched first time, but the second time.
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run the attached sampleText.mxml in debug mode
2. Click "Central California" in the column 2
3. Click open space of outside of ADG, but within this swf. Anywhere, but other components.
Actual Results:
trace(this.focusManager.getFocus()) gives "TextInputXXX"
When you click open space of outside of ADG one more time, then trace(this.focusManager.getFocus()) gives "null".
If you create a monkey patch for TextInput, then it would be clear that TextInput focusOut is not issued the first time, but the second time.
Expected Results:
TextInput focusOut should be issued at the first time when a user clicks outside of ADG.
