Summary:
Flex4 mxml data binding "public" issue
Description:
I'm using flex builder4, then i wrote a mxml sample, but it can't compile successfully.
MXML:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<mx:Application xmlns:mx="http://www.adobe.com/2006/mxml">
<mx:Script source="test.as"/>
<mx:ControlBar id="ctlbar" horizontalAlign="right" width="100%"
paddingRight="
{maxFontSize}
" paddingTop="0" paddingBottom="0">
<mx:Button id="cancelBtn" label="Cancel" minWidth="11"/>
</mx:ControlBar>
</mx:Application>
test.as:
[Bindable]
public var maxFontSize:Number = 115;
I want to use "maxFontSize" as data binding, but it can't compile properly if i use flex sdk4.10, but if i use flex sdk3.5, it will compile successfully. Also if i change "public" to "internal", it will compile successfully even though use sdk4.10. But why this happened? Who knows that? Thanks.
