Summary:
RTE when dragging group column header with a custom renderer
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run attached sample application swc
2. Drag the header of the column group (with combo box) to another position. Crash occurs on the mouse move while mouse button is still down.
The problem occurs in line 4917 in file AdvancedDataGridBaseEx.as method columnDraggingMouseMoveHandler.
Primarily it is caused by the fact that it refers to a loop variable 'i' from the preceding loop which does not have a guard condition for when the break statement never occurs cosing the counter to be incremented beyond the number of elements in the orderedHeadersList array by 1 due to 0 offset indexing.
Technically this var is is out of scope and should not be accessed outside of the loop, this is generally poor coding practice even though in the case of AS it works and clearly developers take advantage of the fact.
Actual Results:
TypeError: Error #1010: A term is undefined and has no properties.
at mx.controls::AdvancedDataGridBaseEx/columnDraggingMouseMoveHandler()[C:\Work\flex\dmv_automation\projects\datavisualisation\src\mx\controls\AdvancedDataGridBaseEx.as:4917]
Expected Results:
No RTE and column group move completes as expected
Workaround (if any):
Cannot subclass and fix because most properties referenced in the method are private
