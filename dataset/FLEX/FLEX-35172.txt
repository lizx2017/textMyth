Summary:
CSS property with more than 1 value does not work in external CSS files
Description:
Having a selector like the following in a CSS file:
.cardTitle
{
color: #fff;
height: 176px;
background:url('assets/Unknown.jpg') center / cover;
}
and assigned like normal: <mdl:CardTitle className="cardTitle">
results in :
this["background"] = [unexpected value type: url('assets/Unknown.jpg'), "center", "/", "cover"];
Unexpected identifier 'value'. Expected either a closing ']' or a ',' following an array element.
This is due to the fact that compiler can't handle CSS properties with more than one values, since the value is an object and the compiler is not ready to deal with it.
