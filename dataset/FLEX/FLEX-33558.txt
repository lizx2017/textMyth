Summary:
CameraUI slow return to flex application on certain devices
Description:
I have been having very slow results with the CameraUI in flex. Initially, I was using version 3.1 which was VERY buggy, and I was running into erroring out returning from the CameraUI, and very slow speeds.
I have since downloaded and installed the newest Apache Flex framework, 4.9.1. The CameraUI returns VERY fast on our Samsung Tab 7.1 that we bought a few months ago. On an older Droid Charge phone, that is up to date with updates, it takes 30-40 seconds to return from the CameraUI into my code. Same with an iPhone 4 running iOS 6.1.
The line in question is marked in yellow below: mpLoader.loadFilePromise(mediaPromise);
Essentially, I call the cameraUI when the user hits a button. The native camera interface opens up right away. A picture is taken. On iOS and Android both, you have to “save” or “use” the picture. Once you click that button in the native UI, the camera holds on a black screen for a long time (up to 30 seconds or so). That’s where the error seems to be, mpLoader.loadFilePromise(mediaPromise);
You can see in the code I have put output statements to a label showing where the code is hanging. It hangs right after it writes out -16
Here is the code:

Here is a video of the behavior on my iPhone: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QufH1ElqXo
the issue starts at :30 and ends around :50
you can see the busy indicator stops spinning for that time
Note the delay of the busy indicator - it happens right as the mpLoader.loadFilePromise(mediaPromise); code is ran.
