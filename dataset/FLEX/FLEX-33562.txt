Summary:
There is no option to change color of selected item text from Dropdownlist. you can only change background color but not selected text color.
Description:
I was using flex 3.5 . Here I used combobox but when I applied customFont family then data was not showing in list. Then I used spark combobox but there rowcount, prompt issue were facing. Then I decided to use s:dropdownlist and changed flash version 4.6 by applying custom skin. here everything was working fine but one issue faced again, I am unable to change the selected item text color. there is only property selectionColor or rollOverColor that change the selection color but not text color.
