Summary:
Custom axis renderers on chart must be of type AxisRenderer, implementing IAxisRenderer throws Runtime Error
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a custom axis renderer instance by implementing the IAxisRenderer Class, and extending from UIComponent instead of AxisRenderer
2. Apply this custom renderer to either the vertical or horizontal axisrenderer instance of a chart, but not to both.
Actual Results:
When the chart is renderered, it throws a runtime error in regard to the drawAxis() method on the AxisRenderer class, stating that the custom axis renderer is not of type AxisRenderer (line 2932 in AxisRenderer.as).
Expected Results:
Should cast the variable 'otherAxis' to IAxisRenderer to support non-AxisRenderer based classes which may be extended from UIComponent, etc...
Workaround (if any):
None... however, the same casting of AxisRenderer is used in 2.0.1 sdk and doesn't throw runtime error...
