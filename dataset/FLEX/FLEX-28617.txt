Summary:
KeyDown event handler not executing on current View if the click events inside ActionBar precede it
Description:
New steps to reproduce:
1. Run the attached app in ADL nexus one.
2. Click 'new view'.
3. Go to menu 'Device' > Back, verify it does NOT go back to the Home view.
3. Click any buttons inside ActionBar.
4. Go to menu 'Device' > 'Back'
Actual result: it goes back to the home view.
Expected result: it should not go back (i.e., event.preventDefault())
---------
This bug is specially annoying when you want to prevent Keyboard.BACK default behavior.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Associate a keyDown handler to a View component: keyDown="onKeyDownHandler(event)".
2. Include some buttons inside the ActionBar (navigation, title or action or all).
3. Click any button you like located inside that ActionBar.
4. Press any key, i.e. BACK key.
Actual Results:
onKeyDownHandler won't execute at all.
Expected Results:
onKeyDownHandler should execute.
Workaround (if any):
1) Instead of listening for keyDown, listen for the backKeyPressed event on the View. Canceling this event will prevent the default back key behavior.
2) Listen for keyDown events on the stage and not on the View.
Attached a little mobile project to show this issue. Reproducible always, including when simulating the application inside the simulator.
