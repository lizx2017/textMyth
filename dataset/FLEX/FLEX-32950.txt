Summary:
RTE with ADG when editedItemPosition/itemEditBeginning is called
Description:
This issue can be reproduced if and only if:
1. There is a custom CheckBox
2. If both vertical and horizontal scrolls are dispatched
(If you pre-scroll to the cell 35, 80, so that it won't need to scroll, you won't get RTE.)

1. Run the attached DataGridTest.mxml along with all the other .as files.
2. Click on the "Edit Cell" button
Actual Results:
TypeError: Error #1009: Cannot access a property or method of a null object reference.
