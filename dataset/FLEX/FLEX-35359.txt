Summary:
Empty map when using -output AND -source-map compiler argument
Description:
If the -output compiler argument is used to redirect compiler output to a folder outside the workspace and the -source-map is also specified, the .map file is created at the location given by the -source argument (along with compiled files) but does not contain any symbol, line count etc... (the properties key are present but do not have any value).
If the -source-map is used without the -output argument, the .map file is correctly filled.
