Summary:
Installer should list the binaries that it downloads and offer to accept/reject that
Description:
As discussed at http://markmail.org/message/lpe4r2acjzs7b6dz :
The installer downloads a number of files (listed in installer/src/sdk-installer-config.xml) and installs them on the user's system.
It currently doesn't make the user aware that this is happening, there should be a
confirmation somewhere before the downloads happen, where the user is given the option of either
a) Reviewing the list of files that are going to be downloaded, and accepting or rejecting the whole thing
b) Say "I don't care, go ahead".
Assigning to version 1.0 for now, though Erik says on-list that he'd like to do that for 1.1.
