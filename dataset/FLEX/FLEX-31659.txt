Summary:
DateTimeAxis: Year Labels Are Incorrectly Placed Off By One Month When Given Date Objects or Milliseconds Since 1970 as a Number
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run the enclosed simplified test case.
2. Observe that the year labels on the x-axis map to chart items for February 1st on the graph.
Actual Results:
The year labels generated by DateTimeAxis align to February 1st of each year.
Expected Results:
The year labels should be aligned to January 1st of each year.
Workaround (if any):
Write a custom parseFunction that handles each chart item's value as a Date object, incrementing the copy by a month before returning it. This causes the DateTimeAxis to correctly align the labels to January 1st at the cost of additional computation and memory usage in order to fool the malfunctioning DateTimeAxis.
I'm not sure if these are related, but this bug appears to have some similarities to FLEXDMV-713 and FLEXDMV-762.
