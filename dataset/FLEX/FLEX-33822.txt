Summary:
FocusManager is looking everywhere on document for ReadioButtonGroup ID.
Description:
FocusManager is looking everywhere for the next focus target. But in case of RadioButtonGroups when these are generated from an mxml template that is not good because these RadioButtonGroups will all have the same id and tabbing will not work properly.
