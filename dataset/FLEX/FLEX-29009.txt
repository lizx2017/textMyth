Summary:
All pod sub menus disappear upon selection of lower sub menu item
Description:
Steps :
In connect meeting
The ability to select items from the menus has become very frustrating. When a menu that I choose has a sub menu, and then attempt to choose something from that sub menu, I lose the sub menu when I go to choose something from it.
Expected Result:
Selecting items - even from long lists - was very easy in C7.5 The sub menu very rarely disappeared.
Any Workarounds:
I find that I need to make sure that I move my mouse exactly horizontal across the original menu until I'm completely inside the sub, then and only then can I move down the sub menu. This becomes very tedious.
