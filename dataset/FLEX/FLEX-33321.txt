Summary:
Falcon doesn't understand overridden setters
Description:
Falcon seems to have some problems when determining the return type of overridden setters.
Try to compile OverridingSetters.as. The end result should show a small textfield with the text "Some text" in it.
When trying to compile with falcon, we get the following error and the compilation stops:
Error: Implicit coercion of a value of type String to an unrelated type Function.
txtfield.text = barFunc("text");
A discovered workaround consists on creating a local variable using the getter first, like:
var barFunc:Function = barFunc;
txtfield.text = barFunc("text");
