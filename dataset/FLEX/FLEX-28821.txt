Summary:
text doesn't take user interaction when a non-modal popup is open
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Add a TextInput and Callout to a mobile app.
2. At runtime, open the callout as non-modal.
3. Try to input text in TextInput.
Actual Results: TextInput doesn't react to click/tap while the non-modal callout is open. Other components work fine.
