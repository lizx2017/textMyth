Summary:
TextInput cursor disappears when PopUpAnchor is displayed
Description:
Code:
<s:layout>
<s:VerticalLayout/>
</s:layout>
<s:TextInput change="popup.displayPopUp = true" tabIndex="0" tabEnabled="true"/>
<s:PopUpAnchor id="popup">
<s:List tabEnabled="true" tabIndex="1"/>
</s:PopUpAnchor>
Using the code above, type something into the TextInput to display the PopUpAnchor containing the List.
Actual Results:
When the List appears, the cursor in the TextInput disappears, but you can still type and move the invisible cursor.
Expected Results:
Cursor doesn't disappear!
Workaround (if any):
Reset TextInput focus by clicking on another option then back into the TextInput to see the cursor again.
EDIT: If you use Button instead of List and type into the TextInput, the Button appears but the cursor does not disappear.
