Summary:
Draging the mouse outside the window with the middle or right button will disable mouse over
Description:
Problem Description: When targeting swf-version=16 or more, draging the mouse outside the window with the middle or right button will disable mouse over on flex components.
Steps to Reproduce:Compile a swf with swf-version=16 or more, drag the mouse outside the window with the middle or right button down.
Actual Result:When hovering any components, there is no over effect.
Expected Result:Components should display a over effect.
Any Workarounds: Click inside the SWF with the button you used on your mouse (right or middle), clicking with the left button won't resolve it. Using swf-version=13 does not have this problem.
