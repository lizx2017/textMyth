Summary:
Renders are not getting recycled properly in Advance Data Grid
Description:
Currently I had created a 3 Advance Data girds with each of 60 rows and 4 columns(only display row at stage are 21), for 1 column only I had created a Renders "AdvanceDataGridSearchRender.mxml",when user click on Next button ,I am navigating across 3 grids(First View-àSecond View-àThird View) by Pushing/Pulling the Render from Cache, when I observe the Instance count It is(21 only) good drop and rendering is little bit Fast ,even when user is navigated to other Grids and scroll down also
Even user is trying to navigate the Differen States of application,Renders associated to Grids are not getting recycled properly.
Actual Results:
