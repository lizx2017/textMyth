Summary:
"mxmlc -dump-config some_file.xml" does not dump all values
Description:
On calling "mxmlc -dump-config some_file.xml" many of the dumped values will be commented out like this:
<!-- version: display the build version of the program-->
<!-- version usage:
<version>boolean</version>
-->
<!-- warnings: toggle the display of warnings-->
<!-- warnings usage:
<warnings>boolean</warnings>
-->
I know that -version will be at default false and -warnings true but I'm not able to tell this for every value. So it would make more sense to really dump every value (as the help is already telling this).
