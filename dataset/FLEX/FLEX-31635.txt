Summary:
Editing a cell and focusing out of the window stops the editing in ADG
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Download & Compile the attached MXML
2. Click on any cell of ADG to edit
3. Focus out of the flex application window
4. Bring back the focus to flex application
5. Repeat the steps from 2 to 4 on DG
Actual Results:
The cell that was being edited before is not editable by default. But, DG makes the cell editable again after the flex application gets the focus.
Expected Results:
The cell in ADG which is being edited before should be automatically made editable when the focus is brought back to Flex application window.
