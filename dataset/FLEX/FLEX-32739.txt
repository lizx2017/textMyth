Summary:
DateTimeAxis has inversion error when labels unit size is set to months.
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. create chart with a DateTimeAxis
2. create data that extends beyond a few months so you can see the labels which contain month/year labels
3. pass data into the chart and watch it fail.
Actual Results:
You see the labels inverted on the axis (from right to left)
Expected Results:
the labels going from left to right.
Workaround (if any):
No work around found, the fix however is very simple in the DateTimeAxis code. In the buildLabelCache() method, under the else after disabledDays/Range where normal label placement is handled. You have two methods where labelCache is built. One for inverted display, the other for non-inverted. In the code I have, they were the exact same for both cases. The result was the previously stated bug.
