Summary:
Checkpoints (and Object Spy) don't work
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Attempt to create a checkpoint in a Flex 4 application
Actual Results:
eg. Browser("Welcome to LiveCycle Administr").Page("#Login").WebElement("Administrator").Check CheckPoint("Administrator")
It does not see objects within the SWF.
Object Spy fails in the same way, but the same objects are found when recording using QTP.
Expected Results:
Checkpoints (and Object Spy) should work
Workaround (if any):
Hand code your checkpoints.
