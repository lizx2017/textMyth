Summary:
ASDOC throws error on public/private keywords in Actionscript file
Description:
This is a duplicate of FLEX-11200, but clarified a bit as it doesn't just pertain to MXML files.
When generating asdocs, if it comes across an actionscript file (not class) that has methods/properties marked public or private it generates an error and fails.
"Error: The public attribute can only be used inside a package."
The work around is to maintain a list of individual classes/directories that will not fail the asdoc generation. This is fairly labor intensive and prone to developers forgetting to update this list when new classes are added which makes the workaround not very acceptable.
