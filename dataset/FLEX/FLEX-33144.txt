Summary:
System IME didn't work when I clicked Spark Button in wmode=opaque or trasparent mode
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create an Flex project using Flash Builder 4.6
2. Add a <s:Button /> control to the application.
3. Add wmode="opaque" to index.template.html
4. Add <input type="text" /> html control to the index.template.html
3. Build the application and choose Debug or Launch.
Actual Results:
Cannot input Korean or Japanese characters into the Html Input control using IME.
Expected Results:
It should support IME well.
Workaround (if any):
Don't use Internet Explorer.
add this code to the application.
(focusManager.mx_internal::IMEEnabled = false
Note:
If I change the option like this (wmode="window") or use other browser, It will be Okay.
Even though IME.enabled = false option should not be affected to OS, It seems to be affected. I think it's Flash Player for Internet Explorer Bug.
May I suggest that mx_internal::IMEEnabled property set to public or default value to False in FocusManager.
