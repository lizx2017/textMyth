Summary:
Putting focus in a popup in an item editor closes the item editor
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run sample file (DataGridEditTest.mxml) WITHOUT the monkey-patched AdvancedDataGridBaseEx.as
2. Click on first column for an item to edit it
3. Focus should be in the textInput. Now press the "down" arrow which should send the focus to the datagrid that has been popped up below
Actual Results:
Item editting closes
Expected Results:
Item edittor should remain open and the focus should go to the DataGrid
Workaround (if any):
None, outside of the monkey-patched version I attached. In the monkey-patched version I changed AdvancedDataGridBaseEx.itemEditorFocusOutHandler() from:
if (event.relatedObject && contains(event.relatedObject))
return;
to:
if (event.relatedObject && owns(event.relatedObject))
return;
