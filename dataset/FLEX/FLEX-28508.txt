Summary:

Description:
App Description:
1. Create an application with multiple states and each state mapped to a view of a ViewStack.
2. Change the state. In the attached swf, click on "change states"
Steps to reproduce:
1. Open ViewStackEx1.swf - Double Click on it
2. Click on button "change states"

The swf file and mxml are attached.
