Summary:
QTP is not recognising Flex objects on flex based application.
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1.static Compile Flex based(3.0) application with the following automation libraries
"flex_builder_dir\sdks\3.0.0\frameworks\libs\automation.swc"
"flex_builder_dir\sdks\3.0.0\frameworks\libs\automation_agent.swc"
"flex_builder_dir\sdks\3.0.0\frameworks\libs\qtp.swc"
"flex_builder_dir\sdks\3.0.0\frameworks\libs\automation_dmv.swc"
2.Intstalled Flex addin on testing machine and launched QTP 9.2(also tried with QTP 10.00) with flex addin enabled
3.Launch the application
4. Try recognising flex objects using object spy
Actual Results:Objects are getting recognised as WinObjects instead of flex objects
Expected Results:Objects should be recognised as Flex objects.
Note:
1) We have another application which is also flex based for that QTP is recognising objects but not this particular one.So i believe QTP is correctly loaded with Flex addin. Also tried with QTP 9.2 and QTP 10 as well, but no luck.
2) This is a web based application.
