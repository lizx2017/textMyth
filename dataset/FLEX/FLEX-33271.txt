Summary:
Falcon tests failing on clean copy from SVN
Description:
As discussed on the dev list ("Falcon compiler(.tests) building"), I'm having some troubles getting the compiler.tests to pass on a clean working copy of the compiler. Attached you can find the output of "ant main" on my machine. Hope this tells you something, otherwise feel free to ping me for more details.
