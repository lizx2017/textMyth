Summary:
Dragging a row with an itemRenderer which extends DefaultGridItemRenderer causes null pointer in mx.utils::MatrixUtil$/isDeltaIdentity()
Description:
See attached for an example. I think this is down to two things:
https://github.com/apache/flex-sdk/blob/develop/frameworks/projects/spark/src/spark/components/gridClasses/DataGridDragProxy.as
element.getLayoutMatrix() is returning null. Doing a check for a null matrix, and returning an identity matrix seems to help
https://github.com/apache/flex-sdk/blob/develop/frameworks/projects/spark/src/spark/components/gridClasses/DataGridDragProxy.as#L201
I think this should be inside the loop, (at line 198)
