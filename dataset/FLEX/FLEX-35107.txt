Summary:
Error setting property of class when the type is XML
Description:
Take the following code:
import org.apache.flex.events.Event;
public class DataEvent extends Event
{
public function DataEvent(type:String)
{ super(type); }
public var xmlData:XML;
}
and somewhere else:
var xml:XML = <foo/>;
var ev:DataEvent = new DataEvent("Data");
ev.xmlData = xml;
The will compile to:
ev.setChild('xmlData', xml);
It appears that it's treating the class as XML although it's just an XML property in an unrelated class.
