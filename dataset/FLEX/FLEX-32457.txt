Summary:
AdvancedDataGrid.selectedItem may not be a reference to an object in the dataProvider
Description:
According to the documentation regarding AdvancedDataGrid.selectedItem:
http://livedocs.adobe.com/flex/3/langref/mx/controls/listClasses/AdvancedListBase.html#selectedItem
—
AdvancedListBase
selectedItem property
selectedItem:Object
A reference to the selected item in the data provider.
The default value is null.
This property can be used as the source for data binding. When this property is modified, it dispatches the valueCommit event.
Implementation
public function get selectedItem():Object
public function set selectedItem(value:Object):void
—
In actuality the selectedItem may refer to an AdvancedDataGridColumn.
A second issue exists where only the left most AdvancedDataGridColumn will be available in selectedItem, regardless of which column header is focused.
Expected Behaviour:
Any AdvancedDataGridColumn should be selectable, not just the left most, for consistency.
Documentation and functionality need to be corrected.
