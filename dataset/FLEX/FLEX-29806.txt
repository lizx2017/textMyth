Summary:
Automation is busted for custom components that are contained by parents that are based on UIComponent
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create custom component A, that is automateable and implement all of IAutomationObject, ensure showInAutomationHierarchy = true
2. Create custom component B, that is not automateable and inherits from UIComponent, ensure showInAutomationHierarchy = false
3. Create custom component C, that is automateable and implement all of IAutomationObject, ensure showInAutomationHierarchy = true
4. Create instance of A, B and C. A contains B which contains C.
5. Try using a QTP feature, such as object spy
Actual Results:
QTP can't see C
Expected Results:
QTP can see C
The problem is because in various places in constructing C's automationId, it ignores the showInAutomationHierarchy flag, and expects component B to create an ID for C, which is invalid.
