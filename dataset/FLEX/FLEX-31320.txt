Summary:
equal, negative values in a dataset do not render at all (the [computed]minimum of the axis is wrong)
Description:
Reproduction:
Look at bug.mxml
the first chart is two equal positive values – renders correctly
the second chart is two unequal negative values – renders correctly
the third chart is two equal negative values – renders nothing
the last chart is two equal negative values but with a minimum manually set – renders correctly
This also happens when there is only one negative value in the dataset, that's how I discovered it. It just doesn't seem to get the negative range correct.
Expected Results: all charts render
Workaround:
set a minimum manually; however, I have to compute it and adjust it by hand over my data, and then I lose the auto adjusting and sizing so it looks bad.
