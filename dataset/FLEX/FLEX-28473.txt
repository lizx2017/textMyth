Summary:
Hit area for beveled button skins needs to be bigger
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Load any Flex app that uses the beveled button skins.
2. Try to press the button
Actual Results:
The button skins are small, and the hit area corresponds to the skin size. This makes the buttons hard to hit.

Expected Results:
The hit area should be made larger. This can be done by drawing a transparent rect that is larger than the skin area.
