Summary:
[FlexJS] BindableCSSStyle do not works or partially works between HTML and SWF
Description:
(This issue once discussed in Apache mailing-list at: http://apache-flex-users.2333346.n4.nabble.com/Updating-className-td12217i20.html)
Requirement
Updating UI components' styles at runtime. If possible, updating their className property at runtime and see it's effect without refreshing browser.
What we have
Updating className property to any component do not works.
Workaround
Using BindableCSSStyle to update any given style at runtime and see it's effect.
Result
BindableCSSStyle API not able to update all it's properties at runtime. Furthermore, it only shown partially working in SWF, HTML version completely broken.
Expected
Class able to change all it's public properties at runtime in both HTML and SWF run.
Observation
As suggested in mailing-list (link given above), BindableCSSStyle used in FlexJSStore example project that supplied within SDK bundle, in /flexjs/FlexJSStore/productsView/ProductCatalogThumbnail.mxml page. I tested, it does updates "border" property to a component at runtime.
It does not updates all other properties at rumtime though (in SWF, HTML version do not works at all), i.e. backgroundColor.
I tested with a simple example, by modifying the "ProductCatalogThumbnail.mxml file only:
<js:beads>
        <js:ContainerDataBinding />
        <js:LayoutChangeNotifier watchedProperty="{borderStyles.borderColor}" initialValue="#FFFFFF" />
 <js:LayoutChangeNotifier watchedProperty="{borderStyles.backgroundColor}" initialValue="#FFFFFF" />
    </js:beads>
<js:style>
       <js:BindableCSSStyles id="borderStyles" borderStyle="solid" borderWidth="1" borderColor="#FFFFFF" backgroundColor="#FFFFFF"/>
</js:style>
...
private function rollOverHandler(event:MouseEvent):void
{
        borderStyles.borderColor = "#0000ff";
        borderStyles.backgroundColor = "#00ffff";
        //style["dropShadowEnabled"] = true;
        buttons.visible = true;
} 
Setting up backgroundColor property in rollOverHandler() never worked, as an example.
