Summary:
Tween.stop can stop some other Tween object after Tween has ended
Description:
Calling Tween.stop (or endTween) can end some other un-related Tween object.
The issue is essentially that Tween object keep an 'id' to refer to index into static activeTweens array. This field isn't assigned an invalid value (NaN/-1???) on removeTween.
