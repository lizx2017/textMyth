Summary:
CLONE -Flex3 QTP plugin performance issue - object recognition and playback of an sdk3.5 application is very slow
Description:
We are facing a similar issue as FLEXENT-749 while automating our flex 3.5 based application.
Object recognition and play back are very slow. IE Browser consumes 100% CPU.
Our application is with flex builder 3.0.2 compiled with 3.5 SDK. In the source bug (FLEXENT-749) you have provided a particular version of qtp.swc. I am not sure if this would work for my application here. Can you please provide an appropriate version of qtp.swc that I need to use?
Thanks
