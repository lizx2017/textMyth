Summary:
Column Chart // itemClick Event // pushes an error #1034 [INSIST UPDATE to RELEASE]
Description:
Found in Version: Flex Builder 3, Version 3, build 3.0.194161
**I found at least 2 other recorded iterations of this issue within this Bug database. It's unacceptable to me and my customers to rely on a critical flex component and find it's not working. Being able to click on chart columns are an intregal part of this component.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a Column Chart, connect it to a viable dataprovider
2. Add the an itemClick event with the chart tag <mx:ColumnChart id="myChart" itemClick="chartChange(event.hitData.item)"/>
3. Complie the chart
4. Click on the bar
Actual Results:
Error #1034 is displayed in a dialog box. See error.TXT attachment.
Expected Results:
This should cause an event trigger and execute a function or declare a variable.
Workaround (if any):
**The code below is the temporary workaround, but is unacceptable as it prevents other events as well. For instance, the change="" event trigger for the HSlider component doesn't work because of the work around below.
private function chartErrorHandler1034():void
{
vbChartCY.addEventListener(ChartItemEvent.CHANGE, chartItemEventChange, true, 0, true);
}
private function chartItemEventChange(event:Event):void
{
event.stopImmediatePropagation();
}
