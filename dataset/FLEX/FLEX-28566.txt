Summary:
Images in IconItemRenderer have a slight load delay even when iconDelay=0
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a new Flex mobile project in Builder with the project in the attached Simplified.zip file.
4. Launch the application on a Xoom
5. Quickly throw scroll down the List
Actual Results:
1. Notice that some icons are white before an image is loaded
2. The scrolling is slow
Expected Results:
1. Since these files are on the local disk they should load very fast and we should never see a white place holder
2. Better performance.
