Summary:
stage.softKeyboardRect is only set the first time a StageText gets focus
Description:
Problem:
The first time a StageText gets focus, stage.softKeyboardRect is set correctly. Subsequent times the StageText gets focus, stage.softKeyboardRect is left as [0,0,0,0].
Method:
1) Build and run the attached app.
2) Tap in the StageText.
3) Tap outside the StageText.
4) Tap back in the StageText and note the softKeyboardRect values dumped.
Result:
softKeyboardRect is empty.
Expected:
softKeyboardRect is populated like the first time the StageText was tapped.
