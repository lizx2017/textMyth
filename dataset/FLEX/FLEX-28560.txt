Summary:
CLONE -Android RAW camera completely unusable while holding phone in PORTRAIT orientation
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. open tour de mobile flex for android
2. open raw camera while holding the phone in portrait
3. notice that while holding the phone in portrait the camera is sideways (it even says orientation not accounted for, as if adobe is aware of the issue but not trying to do anything about it)
Actual Results:
It displays a sideways camera
Expected Results:
a non rotated image
Workaround (if any):
I could force the end user to use the application in landscape. This creates for a really bad user experience. Some people will definitely prefer to use my application in portrait over landscape. I dont want to force them to use landscape. It will also be confusing for end users due to the ability for all the other areas of my application they can change the orientation. I would predict locking them in landscape for this particular section would have a negative impact for application reviews.
