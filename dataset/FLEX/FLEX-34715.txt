Summary:
Flex Mobile DateSpinner locale="de_DE"
Description:
The error occurs only on IOS Devices using the DateSpinner with locale="DE_de" and displaymode="time" or "date_time"!
DateSpinner with displaymode="date" works fine.
The component never gets a creationComplete-Event. It takes Minutes to Display or the App crashes.
The error occurs only after Release Building for IOS Devices. It doesn't occur by using Packaging Method: "Fast".
We are currently not able to bring our App to App Store Review. We please need a fast solution on that.
Thanks from Germany.
