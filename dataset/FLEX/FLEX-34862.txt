Summary:
RTE on ListBase when dataProvider is changed
Description:
Changing the dataProvider causes a rollOut event when itemRollOut has an event assigned to the List. If the dataProvider has less items, there's a RTE at dataProvider.getItemAt(itemIndex).
I believe the correct way to fix this is to check that the dataProvider exists and the correct index exists. Although, even this can cause the event to be dispatched referencing a new item in the new provider.
