Summary:
ObjectUtil.compare() throws TypeError: Error #1006: value is not a function
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Call ObjectUtil.compare() with two identical objects that are not reference-equivalent; this is required to ensure that the execution hits the following line (line 834) in ObjectUtil:
var isDynamicObject:Boolean = isDynamicObject(a);
2. Line 834 throws a TypeError: Error #1006: value is not a function.
Expected result:
No TypeError should be thrown; ObjectUtil.compare() should return zero.
The problem can be solved by renaming the isDynamicObject variable to isDynamic.
