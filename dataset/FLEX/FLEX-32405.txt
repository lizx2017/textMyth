Summary:
AdvancedDataGrid throws RangeError in expandAll() or expandChildrenOf()
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
This is using Flex Builder 3.0 (3.0.2.214193)
1. Add a filterFunction to an ADG (with hierarchical xml data) which removes a leaf (so the parent has no children)
2. Call adg.refresh() to apply the filter
3. Call adg.expandAll() or adg.expandChildrenOf(theParent)
Actual Results:
In step 2, the leaf is removed from the grid. The parent still shows up as a yellow folder with an indicator arrow.
In step 3 the following exception is thrown:
RangeError: Index '0' specified is out of bounds.
at mx.collections::ListCollectionView/getItemAt()[C:\autobuild\3.2.0\frameworks\projects\framework\src\mx\collections\ListCollectionView.as:422]
at mx.collections::ListCollectionView/http://www.adobe.com/2006/actionscript/flash/proxy::getProperty()[C:\autobuild\3.2.0\frameworks\projects\framework\src\mx\collections\ListCollectionView.as:698]
at mx.controls::AdvancedDataGrid/expandChildrenOf()[C:\work\flex\dmv_automation\projects\datavisualisation\src\mx\controls\AdvancedDataGrid.as:5377]
at Test3/___Test3_Button2_click()[C:\Documents and Settings\marwic\My Documents\Flex Builder 3\RefDB\src\Test3.mxml:135]
Expected Results:
No exception should be thrown.
Also, I think that the childless parent should become a leaf, ie it should show as a leaf icon with no indicator arrow. Or at least the indicator arrow should be removed
Workaround (if any):
None.
Speculation:
I think this is because the ADG still thinks the parent has children and when it tries to expand the parent, the RangeError is thrown. So, somewhere the parent should be tagged as isBranch=false once the filter is applied.
