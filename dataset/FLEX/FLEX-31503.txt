Summary:
ODG takes huge time to render initally (goes to Not responding stage also) when a little complex column/row axis structure is provided. Scrolling also makes application not responding for some time
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. run bug file
2. click on click me to trace query button
after data comes try scrolling horizontally
Actual Results:
ODG takes around 40 sec to show up data while data is available within 10 sec (as seen from trace). using horizontal scroll bar makes ODG non responsive and scrolling takes 10-15 sec
Expected Results:
better performance results for render time and scrolling time
