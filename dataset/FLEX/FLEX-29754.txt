Summary:
Flex3 QTP plugin performance issue - playback of an sdk3 application is 2-3x slower than a nsdk2 compiled flex app
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Attached is a simple test case that demonstrates an ~2-3x slowdown in performance of the Flex3 QTP plugin when comparing an sdk3 compiled application to one compile with sdk2.
2. In creating the test case from the full application, the more complex the component &containers, the more dramatic the slowdown.
The customer is not able to get a complete automation run- QTP either crashes or runs out of memory.
3. The QTP test is a 1 liner:
Browser("Browser_2").FlexApplication("qtpPerf").FlexButton("index:0").Click
Result:
SDK3 = ~20 seconds
SDK2 = ~6 seconds
Actual Results: very slow QTP playback
Expected Results: playback on par with Flex2 QTP plugin
