Summary:
[AIR specific]when a flex sub-app (3rd level) is loaded into new application domain in an Air app, we get a warning message.
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a new Air project and copy the attched mxml file 'main'
2. include the automation swcs and include the src folder for AIR.
3. Create a new Flex project and include the automation swcs.
4. Copy the mxml files 'loader1, loader2, loader3, loader4 to the flex project.
5. Compile the mxml file.
6. Copy the compiled swfs loader1 and loader2.swf to localhost, loader3 and loader4 in remote server. (so that they are in a different security domain)
7. Start QTP
8. Run the AIR app and load loader1, loader2, loader3, and loader4 on clicking on Test button.
9. Start Recording.
10. click on a button on the loader3(sub app3).
Actual Results:We get a message as given below.
"application is linked with AT library for AIR. But AIR to be functional automation_air library should be used. It is highly recommended to add this library before proceeding"
If we click on 'OK' and continue, we can perform record, replay, highlight in application. But, when we add checkpoint, or add object to repository, we will not get the expected results.
[Note: This issue is occuriing when the swf in the remote server is loaded into new application domain.]
Expected Results: No such error message should be shown. We should be able to perform all operations including adding a checkpoint, adding object to repository, etc.
