Summary:
ChartItemEvents should be non-bubbling by default
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. ChartItemEvent should be non-bubbling by default. Events like itemMouseDown, itemRollOver, itemClick, itemDoubleClick, and change should all be non-bubbling. These names conflict with other event names (like ones found in DataGrid or List), and that means Charts may not be contained in DataGrids or Lists--if they are and the List or DataGrid has any event listeners, an RTE will occur.
Actual Results:
Bubbling events may cause RTEs
Expected Results:
Non-bubbling events
Workaround (if any):
Capture the event and call stopPropogation()
