Summary:
"License not present. With the trial version only limited records are allowed" message when recording automation script
Description:
I have developed a custom agent for automation of flex application.
I have this error message occurring systematically after the same number of actions recorded.
I have compiled my agent with Flash Builder 4.5 premium, but it was initially developed with a trial version, then compiled with a standard version (Flash builder 4) which I upgraded to 4.5 premium after searching for similar issues on the web and understanding that a pro/premium license was needed.
Despite recompiling (each time with FB 4.5 premium) before and after removing my old FB 4 standard, nothing has changed and the error is still occurring.
Please let me know asap if there is any solution to this problem (as a last resort, I am currently installing FB 4.5 premium on a "virgin" virtual machine where no FB has ever been installed before
