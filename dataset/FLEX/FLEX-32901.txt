Summary:
Chart tooltips overlap other controls
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create column chart and several other controls around it (see the screenshot)
2. Pass tool tips data to the chart and make it show tool tips that are close to the border of chart control
Actual Results:
The shown tool tips are not clipped on the border of the chart control (see the screenshot) and use all screen area for positioning.
Expected Results:
They should be positioned inside the control
Additional info:
I also took a look at the library code and found the following method, that confirms my guess.
protected function positionAllDataTips(hitSet:Array):void
{
...
var screenTL:Point = new Point(4, 4);
var screenBR:Point = new Point(screen.width - 4, screen.height - 4);
...
if (tipData.px > screenBR.x - tipData.width)
{
tipData.px = screenBR.x - tipData.width;
if (maxForLeftTips > tipData.px)
{ maxForLeftTips = tipData.px; repeatLayout = true; }
}
...
}
Is there any chance to limit tool tips positioning area?
