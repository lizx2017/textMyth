Summary:
DateTimeAxis shows incorrect labels when dates span daylight savings time boundary.
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
This was discovered in Flex 2.0.1. hf3, but still seems to be present in Moxie.
Use the following code:
<mx:Application xmlns:mx="http://www.adobe.com/2006/mxml">
<mx:Script>
<![CDATA[
import mx.collections.ArrayCollection;
[Bindable]
private var chartData:ArrayCollection = new ArrayCollection( [
{ date: new Date( 2007, 10, 3 ), profit: 2000 }
,
{ date: new Date( 2007, 10, 4 ), profit: 1000 }
,
{ date: new Date( 2007, 10, 5 ), profit: 1500 }
,
{ date: new Date( 2007, 10, 6 ), profit: 1800 }
,
{ date: new Date( 2007, 10, 7 ), profit: 2400 }
]);
]]
>
</mx:Script>
<mx:Panel title="LineChart Example"
height="100%" width="100%" layout="horizontal">
<mx:LineChart id="linechart" height="100%" width="45%"
paddingLeft="5" paddingRight="5"
showDataTips="true" dataProvider="
{chartData}
">
<mx:horizontalAxis>
<mx:DateTimeAxis dataUnits="days" displayLocalTime="true" autoAdjust="false" />
</mx:horizontalAxis>
<mx:series>
<mx:LineSeries xField="date" yField="profit" form="curve" displayName="Profit" />
</mx:series>
</mx:LineChart>
</mx:Panel>
</mx:Application>
Actual Results:
The labels on the chart show 11/4 twice, and each day after the DST break is "off by 1" â€“ 11/3/07, 11/4/07, 11/4/07, 11/5/07, 11/6/07.
However, hovering over the chart to view the data tips shows the correct date values. If you add a label function, the date being passed to the label function is off by one because the hours are set incorrectly. For example, instead of 11/5/07 12:00am, the value passed to labelFunction is 11/4/07 11:00pm, which is what gives the "off by 1" date value even though it's only off by an hour because of the daylight savings time switch.
Expected Results:
The labels on the chart should be 11/3/07, 11/4/07, 11/5/07, 11/6/07, 11/7/07.
Workaround (if any):
Use a custom label function and adjust the hour of the date value passed in to account for the different timeZoneOffset.
