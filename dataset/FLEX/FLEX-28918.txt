Summary:
In the event.result there's a loss of data after the data is passed on from the server response to the flex sdk rpc classes. The data doesn't load fine unless the user clears the cache and refreshes the screen.
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1.Load a module A having result data having an arraycollection of AbcVO which has children VO-Abc1VO and ABC2VO.
2.The data inside the child VOs doesnt load unless the cache is cleared and browsing history deleted.
3.Clear the cache and try loading it, the data of all the children VOs load fine.
Actual Results:
Complex VO data loads only on clearing of cache.
Expected Results:
Complex VO data should load always
