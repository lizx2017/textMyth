Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1.Go to the link.
2.
3.
Actual Results:
take to the EULA page every time.
Expected Results:
download the installer.
Workaround (if any):
chat with a support rep online, she is no help. She said that she can download. I ask her to shared my screen. She basically told me to call adobe. I called adobe, the first time, it takes about 45 minutes. I did my work, get my tea from starbuck and attend a meeting. Then when I just start to talk to the rep. It get disconnected. I then choose the callback option. I got disconnected second time right after I talked to the rep for 30 second. The customer service is no existence. Can somebody fix the download issue? It is stupid. When you post a download link, please make sure that it works.
