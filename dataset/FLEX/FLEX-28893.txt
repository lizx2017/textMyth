Summary:
LabelItemRenderer opaqueBackground persists after rotating from landscape to portrait
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run the attached application (only tested with Android so far). The View uses a custom List skin that adds padding around the dataGroup skin part. The List uses the standard IconItemRenderer.
2. Turn to landscape
3. Scroll to the bottom of the list
4. Turn to portrait
Actual Results:
Some item renderers still show the opaqueBackground color based on the landscape size of the list
Expected Results:
All item renderers should be updated.
Workaround (if any):
Subclass IconItemRenderer and set opaqueBackground=null.
