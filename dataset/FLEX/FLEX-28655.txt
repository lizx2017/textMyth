Summary:
SwatchPanel does not respect the textInputClass style
Description:
When setting the textInputClass on SwatchPanel it should work as documented:
// Mechanism to use FTETextInput. Look for it in SwatchPanel and
// if not found see if we got it from our parent.
The bug is on line 1015:
textInput = new textInputClass();
Should be:
textInput = new c();
