Summary:
[QTP] Module based application is partially enabled
Description:
Hello,
I am trying to creates test using QTP on our company module-based Flex application.
The application use a laucher swf which is QTP compiled with all automation libraries (automation*.swc + qtp.swc) to load swf modules which are not compiled with automation libraries.
This was working fine until our lastest release.
Now it seems that when some modules are loaded, the whole Flex application is recognized as a MacromediaFlashPlayerActiveX object. Other modules are not affected.
This is the same behavior as when I used the Object Spy (object inspector) on a non-enabled Flex application, for instance : http://blogs.ilog.com/elixir/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/orgcharteditor2.swf.
The some behaviour was also present when the id attribute in the wrapper HTML file was using hyphen in the value, e.g. id="my-app".
Actual Results: Flex application is recognized as a MacromediaFlashPlayerActiveX object.
Expected Results: Normal automation-support for all modules.
