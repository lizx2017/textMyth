Summary:
Problem with multiple axis charts with one linear axis and another logarithmic axis
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. We are having some problems in a multiple axis chart when the first axis is logarithmic and the second one linear. The problem happens when we set a LogAxis to the chart.verticalAxis property and a LinearAxis to one of the series verticalAxis property. I am attaching two mxml files that should render graphs that look alike but the first one (LogAxis1.mxml) has incorrect values in the left axis (screenshots attached as well). While debugging this we found a problem with the computedMaximum values in buildLabelCache function inside LogAxis.as. When we have a scenario like the one in the first mxml file, the computedMaximum behaves as if we had a linear c
hart instead of a logarithmic one and this is causing the problems. If we have a big range in the values in the dataProvider, computing this function as if we had a linear chart instead of a logarithmic one can cause the application to timeout. Why is this happening with the first file? This is only happening with logarithmic axes.
Operating System: Windows Server 2003
Has it ever worked? If so, what's changed? (provide comments in description field): No
Same results with different file?: No
2. I suggested one workaround for the problem by specifying the maximum value to 10000000 and if this is done the charts appears OK, but this is not accepted and it cant be implemented. "Basically the workaround is not practical for most real applications. It is helpful in a sample app where you hard code all the data. But in real applications, not all the time you know what data you are going to get."
Actual Results: The result shows infinity on the labels of vertical axis which is created using LogAxis.
Expected Results: The labels must be displayed correctly and the values must be displayed properly.
Workaround (if any): by setting the maximum property of the LogAxis. But the workaround is not accepted.
<mx:verticalAxis>
<mx:LogAxis id="v1" maximum="10000000"/>
</mx:verticalAxis>
Attached is the sample code and the screenshots for reproducing the issue.
