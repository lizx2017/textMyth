Summary:
BubbleChart + CartesianDataCanvas causes incorrect positioning of CartesianDataCanvas childrens or the chart bubbles
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
We are trying to build a dashboard. One of the charts of the dashboard is a 2x2 chart. In this chart we draw a vertical and horizontal lines to denote 4 quadrants of the 2x2 chart. I use a BubbleChart and a CartesianDataCanvas to draw the lines on the chart. The bubble chart draws both the lines but there is a problem.
The problem: The Horizontal line (attached to the yAxis) draws correctly but the vertical line (attached to the xAxis) draws a little up. We tried diferent things before laying out the line objects on the CartesianDataCanvs (like chart.validateNow(), cartesianDataCanvas.validateNow(), cartesianDataCanvas.validateData()), but none helped. The problem changed for e.g the vertical line started drawing correctly but the horizontal line did not draw on the value specified (insted of drawing on yAxis value 17, it would draw on 16.5), we also noticed in this scenario that the bubbles in the bubble chart were not drawing correctly either. They too were offset. Another thing we noticed in the same scenario was, the bubbles in the horizontal center were offset by a few pixels but the bubbles away from the horizontal center (up or down) were offset more in terms of pixels.
We tried the same logic on Line and Bar chart and the behavior was perfect ... no issues at all.
I then build a sample application to check this behavior. The sample app and a screenshot is attached to this bug. The sample app has 2 charts Line and Bubble. I use the same logic to render 2 lines on both the charts CartesianDataCanvas. The Bubble chart behaves as mentioned above while the Line Chart draws correctly.
Actual Results:
Vertical line drawn on the CartesianDataCanvas of the Bubble Chart is not positioned correctly (y offset is a problem).
Expected Results:
The object placed on the CartesianDataCanvas should offset correctly.
