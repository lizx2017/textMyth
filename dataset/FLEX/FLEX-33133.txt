Summary:
SWC External Libraries included when FactoryClass is used.
Description:
I'm using FlashDevelop to create native .IPA-compiled projects from AS3 code. I noticed when I include an .SWC library externally (and later compile in an .ANE for the final build), it always errored and crashed on me.
I eventually tracked this down to preloader behaviour. I use a factoryClass to build a preloader to my application, and any references to .SWC classes within the preloader will be included despite the compiler being instructed to leave them as external libraries. Moving my references out of the preloader will result in an appropriate compile with no errors.
I've posted a longer description and a test project w/examples here:
