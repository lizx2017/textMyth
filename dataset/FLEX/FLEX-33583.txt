Summary:
Context3D::setSamplerStateAt parameters missing in API
Description:
Their are missing parameters Context3D::setSamplerStateAt API
When looking at the general parameters sent as sampler state using AGAL, you will notice 5 possible parameters that define the state.
<cube,linear,mipnearest,clamp,dxt1>
The current setSamplerStateAt() API signature is as follows:
public function setSamplerStateAt(sampler:int, wrap:String, filter:String, mipfilter:String):void
Without all of the necessary state parameters, it deems the functionality as incomplete and unable to perform required functions needed to decouple and manage sampler state at runtime. Having this functionality would be in line with standard practices and provide the ability to reuse shaders for different texture types and allow for samplers to be derived after the the texture type has been derived, both of which are assumed fundamental to sampler state management.
