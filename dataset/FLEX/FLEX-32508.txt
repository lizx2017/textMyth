Summary:
why not createRow() be a protected function instead of private?
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Let the variableRowHeight of the ADG be true.
2. Change the last "data" row' height.
3. Or Chage a certain row' height to 0.
Actual Results:
for No 2., all the empty rows' height changed with the last "data" row.
for No 3, space appears!
Expected Results:
for No 2., the empty rows' height do not change.
for No 3, no space.
Workaround (if any):
Since we have different request arround the row's height, why not createRow() be a protected function instead of private?
Or, we have to override the createLockedRows and makeRowsAndColumns in order to correct just 2 rows in the
AdvancedDataGridBase.as→createRow()→Line 1625, 1679
–
// if we've run out of data, we dont make renderers
// and we inherit the previous row's height or rowHeight
// if it is the first row.
hh = currentRowNum > 1 ? rowInfo[currentRowNum - 1].height : rowHeight;
and
if (hh == 0) // hh can be zero if we had zero width
hh = rowHeight;
