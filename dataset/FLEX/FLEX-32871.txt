Summary:
AdvancedDataGrid dropEnabled Target Fails When Using HierarchalData
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create an Application with the mx:AdvancedDataGrid component, feeding it hierarchical data
2. Enable dropEnabled on ADG
3. Create a List with a dataprovider feeding the same object type
4. Set dragEnabled on List
Actual Results:
When dragging items from the list, the ADG content area does not accept the dragged item as a valid drop target.
Expected Results:
AdvancedDataGrid accepts the dragged item as expected.
Workaround (if any):
Subclass ADG and expose listContent (AdvancedListBaseContentHolder) as a public variable. Add a DragEnter event handler to the ADG, prevent the default event behaviour, and manually assign the publicly exposed listContent as the accepted drop target via DragManager.acceptDragDrop(). This will however prevent DragMove operations on the ADG if the event's default behavior is prevented, however.
I've attached the workaround ... this behavior ONLY seems to happen when using hierarchical data. If given a flat ArrayCollection, all dragging operations behave as expected.
