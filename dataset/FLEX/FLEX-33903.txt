Summary:
Type coercion missing, perhaps
Description:
I have AS code like this (from org.apache.flex.html.staticControls.DataGrid):
public function set dataProvider(value:Object):void
{
IDataGridModel(model).dataProvider = value;
}
Compiling into JavaScript the result looks like:
org.apache.flex.html.staticControls.DataGrid.prototype.set_dataProvider = function(value) {
IDataGridModel(this.get_model()).set_dataProvider(value);
};
The causes "IDataGridModel not found" runtime error. I believe IDataGridModel should be fully qualified (the goog.require is in the file) but perhaps that even would not produce the correct coercion (not sure, really).
