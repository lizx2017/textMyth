Summary:
sampleCIProject in FlexUnit has failing tests out of the box
Description:
To get started with FlexUnit I built the sampleCIProject in the binary distribution with Ant. Both of the tests in EchoPanelTest failed with timeouts. I googled around and found some old (2013) Adobe forum discussions that said that UIImpersonator doesn't work anymore with newer Flex versions. I replaced this line:
UIImpersonator.addChild(panel);
with:
FlexGlobals.topLevelApplication.addElement(panel);
(and put in an import mx.core.FlexGlobals and the tests passed.
