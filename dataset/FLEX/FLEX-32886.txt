Summary:
PieSeries incorrectly generates PieSeriesLegendData
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a PieChart and use a fillFunction to define colors for the various wedges
2. Attach a Legend to the chart
3. The colors in the Legend do not match the colors of the wedges
Actual Results:
The colors shown in the Legend are actually those coming from the fills array and not those that the fillFunction has generated.
Expected Results:
Colors in the Legend should match colors of the wedges
Workaround (if any):
The PieSeriesItem objects inside renderData cache actually contain the correct color in their fill property. Workaround is to entend PieSeries, override the getter for legendData, iterate over each PieSeriesLegendData and set fill of legendData to that of pieSeriesItem.
FIX:
PieSeries.as # 506
legendData.fill = current.fill;
NOTE: Issue happens in 3.5 too.
