Summary:
Flex Automation Framework doest give event when Click on Flex TextInput field followed by Pres Shift key(or Home key or End key)
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1.Click on the Flex TextInput field
2.press any of these keys(Shift/HOME/END)
Actual Results:
you will not get either click event from automation framework or a Key Input event.
Expected Results:
you should get a click event followed by a Key input event for the keys(SHIFT/HOME/END)
Workaround (if any):
We do a click and press any key other than special keys(Shift/HOME/END) . Then we get the click event and a key input event for that key.
But Our client has the requirement to record the AUT using RFT for this combination of speciall keys.
