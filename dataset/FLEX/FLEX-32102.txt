Summary:
Open/Close animation has problems when variableRowHeight and wordWrap is true on ADG
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create ADG with hierarchical data with long labels. Set variableRowHeight and wordWrap to true.
2. Resize the first column so that there is wordwrapping.
3. Open/Close nodes.
Actual Results:
Animation doesn't happen for all the children. It stops when there are few children visible. Then there is a redraw which corrects this problem.
Expected Results:
No jerks and flashes.
Workaround (if any):
Turn off animation.
