Summary:
ensureIndexIsVisible() does not work for spark.components.List
Description:
The method ensureIndexIsVisible() does not really work, when an item has been added to a List recently.
You have to use workarounds like the one described at the http://flexponential.com/2011/02/13/scrolling-to-the-bottom-of-a-spark-list/
I am attaching a very simple test case ScrollToBottom.mxml which demonstrates the failure (and the workaround) for Flex 4.10.0.
