Summary:
Automation not getting aware of the new objects being made visible while using States
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1.Use the Flex Project Archive "Michael181157018.zip"
2.DeliveriesNavigator.mxml will have to be replaced at "src\com\cpex\delivery\europe\common\view\"
with problemDeliveriesNavigator.mxml code(in the same folder)
once the code is swapped QTP cannot recognize the components within the application.
Actual Results:
QTP cannot recognize the components within the application which have been set visible.
Expected Results:
QTP should recognize the components within the application which have been set visible.
Workaround (if any):
1. When utilizing Flex view states, use <mx:AddChild /> and <mx:RemoveChild /> objects, instead of just <mx:SetProperty target="
{dashboard}" name="visible" value="false"/>.
2. When constructing my main container, all children containers - Dashboard, DailyEmissions, MonthlyEmissions, ect. were contained by one main container, so, upon user interaction, the Flex view states mechanism made them visible/invisible - <mx:SetProperty target="{dashboard}
" name="visible" value="false"/>. This approach did not work with qtp libs...have to contain Dashboard and DailyEmissions, MonthlyEmissions and other commodity/Module related components into separate containers. You can see that in the attached file(problemDeliveriesNavigator.mxml and DeliveriesNavigator.mxml) on lines: 242 - 282.
