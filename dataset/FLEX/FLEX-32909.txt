Summary:
ADG doesn't remember the cell position when a column is moved AND used tab key to focusin.
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run the attached DataGridTest.mxml
2. Click "Test2-2" cell. It is editable=true
3. Mouse down the header "editable false 3" and move the column to second from left
None of a cell is selected after the column move.
4. Click the TextInput which is located above ADG.
5. Hit tab key once then the focus is in ADG now.
Actual Results:
The selected cell should be still Test2-2; however, Test5-2 is selected.
AND Test5-2 is editable=false; however, you can edit the cell.
Expected Results:
Test2-2 should be selected instead of Test5-2.
