Summary:
Licensing for command-line based builds using data visualization components no longer works
Description:
Using Flex 3 Beta 1, I was able to setup an ant task that looked like this:
<target name="compile-production" depends="compile-skins">
<mxmlc file="${flexDirectory}/main.mxml" output="${deployDirectory}/main.swf"
locale="en_US">
<license product="charting" serial-number="${FLEX_CHARTING_SERIAL}"/>
</mxmlc>
</target>
Unfortunately, since upgrading to Beta 2, I now get the following error message:
compile-production:
[mxmlc] command line: Error: unknown configuration variable 'licenses.license charting XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX'
[mxmlc]
[mxmlc] Use 'mxmlc -help' for information about using the command line.
(Yes, I replaced XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX with my own serial number)
I suspect that the name of the licensed component has changed, particularly given that the flex charting SKU has been eliminated and replaced with Flex Builder 3 Professional. How can I continue using a command-line based build? Can this procedure be better documented than some forum postings?
