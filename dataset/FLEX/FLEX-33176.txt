Summary:
debugger fails to connect to the running application on Android device
Description:
1. Download and install the tool available at http://people.apache.org/~bigosmallm/installapacheflex/
(Version used 0.8.3)
2. Run the application
3. This should package the Apache Flex SDK and make it suitable for it to use with Flash Builder
4. Now, in Flash Builder, create a flex mobile application and debug it on an Android device
Actual results: Debugger fails to connect to the running application on android device
Note: this issue is specific to Windows. It works fine on MAC.
Expected results: Debugger should connect to the running application on the device and we should be able to debug the application in Flash Builder
workaround: After the tool completes the installation process manually overlay the AIR SDK from the location http://airdownload.adobe.com/air/win/download/3.1/AdobeAIRSDK.zip into the installed location
