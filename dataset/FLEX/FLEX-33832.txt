Summary:
spark DataGrid editors do not work for cells that must be scrolled to
Description:
Expected behavior:
When editing a spark datagrid with editable cells that has a scrollbar due to cells being out of view, I expect to be able to click on any cell to have a text edit window (or custom editor) display. The edit item should stay with the cell if the user scrolls the datagrid while the edit item is active.
Actual behavior:
When clicking to edit any cell on a scrollable grid, all cells within the initial view (that is, without requiring you to scroll down) can be clicked to edit as normal. However, by scrolling a little bit down, edit windows begin to display several cells BELOW the clicked cell. If one scrolls further and clicks on the cell, no edit window appears anywhere giving the impression that the cell is not responding to edits. Furthermore, with any cell, if you successfully start and item editor, if the user scrolls the grid, the item editor stays stationary while the grid of cells scrolls under it. I would have expected the item editor to scroll with the cell it is attached to...
