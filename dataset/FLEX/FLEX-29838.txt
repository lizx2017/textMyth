QTP Performance is very slow or Nill for the Only one Particular screen of My Application( NEW SSI SCREEN), its not identifiying the Objects.
Description:
Steps to reproduce:

QTP performance is very poor only for the one particula screen called NEW SSI in my Flex app, it will take 5 to 6 min to capture any of the element from that screen.
I m not getting why only with that screen, for remaining screen i m not facing that issue.
