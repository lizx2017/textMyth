Summary:
LayoutManager initializes components which are no longer on stage
Description:
Scenario A: during an object's validation cycle some code resulting from validateSize(), validateProperties() or validateDisplayList() results in the object's removal from stage.
Scenario B: a user performs an action whose effect is the removal of a component, exactly when that component is being validated in phases (LayoutManager.usePhasedInstantiation == true, which is to say, in the span of two-three frames).
Expected behaviour: LayoutManager detects the object's removal from stage, stops validating it, and never sets its initialized flag to true.
Actual behaviour: LayoutManager does not detect the object's removal from stage, continues validating it, and ends up setting the object's initialized flag to true.
Unit test: LayoutManager_FLEX_35321_Tests.
