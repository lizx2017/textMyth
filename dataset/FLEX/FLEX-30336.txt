Summary:
Automation Fails to Retrieve Panel Children
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1.Create a component with a Panel or TitleWindow
2. Add at least one item to the controlBarGroup.
3. Try to lookup the automation children of the panel or window using getAutomationChildAt()
Actual Result: Passing in the index of any child of the panel not inside the controlBarGroup will cause the GetAutomationChildAt() method to return null;
Expected Results: The method should return the child whose index corresponds to the index passed in.
Workaround (if any): The problem lies in the SparkPanelAutomationImpl class. By creating a custom panel and automation delegate it is possible to override the broken getAutomationChildAt() method.
