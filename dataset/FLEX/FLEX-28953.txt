Summary:
TextInput text the wrong color when using CSS class selectors, TextInputSkin, first gaining focus and using a prompt
Description:
Flex 4.6.0
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a couple of TextInput's so you can add and remove focus from them.
2. Give each TextInput a prompt (it is important to add a prompt to see the bug).
3. Specify the skinClass on each to use spark.skins.mobile.TextInputSkin (it is important to use this skin to see the bug).
2. Create a CSS class selector for TextInput and specify a color (it is important to set the color via a class selector to see the bug).
2. Compile and run on the iPad
Actual Results: The first time either of the TextInput's gains focus the text is the wrong color. Once focus is removed the text changes to the correct color, and is correct from there on.
Expected Results: When the TextInput has focus it should always be the specified color.
Workaround (if any):
1. This works fine if the style is specified inline, so use inline styles.
2. This works fine if spark.skins.mobile.StageTextInputSkin is used instead of spark.skins.mobile.TextInputSkin
3. This works fine if no prompt is used.
