Summary:
SkinnableTextBase steals focus by callLater(textDisplay.setFocus)
Description:
The support class:
spark.components.supportClasses.SkinnableTextBase
has a critical issue in line 1879:
callLater(textDisplay.setFocus)
The usage of call later will lead to possible focus losses in case of environments with out mouse usage.
Examples:
TextBox added to stage, afterwards a popup / alter is added
TextBox is added and removed to / from stage
Alert is opened over textbox, alert close will trigger switch to other component, but text box will be reactivated for a short moment.
All this cases will have a critical focus loss.
Please change in spark.components.supportClasses.SkinnableTextBase
line 1879 to:
textDisplay.setFocus();
By the way:
A callLater workaround is a bad practice to fix some skin state issues, especially only slow computers with possible dropped frames.
