Summary:
LogAxis Chart Fails on zero values
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create new project
2. Copy LogAxis example from Adobe Docs
3. Change one of the "Amount" values to 0 (zero)
4. run application.
Actual Results:
No Graph displayed at all.
Expected Results:
Graph with all values, even if one of them is zero!
Workaround (if any):
None that I know of.
Yes I have tired filterData="false" with no effect.
Working with dynamic data, sometime Zero's are produced so this needs to be handled.
mx:Chart is where this fails, not listed in the components drop down, so sorry if this is listed incorrectly, wasn't sure what to list it under.
