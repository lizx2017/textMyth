Summary:
Application performance degrades and for some of the functionalities application hangs after configuring QTP to identify the Flex objects
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Make the configuration changes in the application build for QTP to identify the Flex objects
Attached file describes all the steps followed for the configuration changes done for identifying flex objects
2. Once the build is QTP enabled Flex objects are getting identified but for some of the functionalities application hangs.
For example on all type of pop up if user selected cancel option, application hangs.
3.This is not the case with the build which is not QTP enabled, in non QTP enabled application build all the functionalities are working fine.
4. And also the Performance of application degrades due to Flex configuration changes done for QTP
Actual Results:
Application hangs on clicking "cancel" option displayed on all type of pop ups displayed on the application and also application performance degrades due to Flex conf changes done for QTP
Expected Results:
Application should not hang and also Application performance should not degrade due to Flex conf changes done for QTP
