Summary:
Accordion dispatches change event when an already selected header is clicked and the selection doesn't actually change
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create an Accordion with two AccordionContents.
2. Add a change handler to the Accordion.
3. Click on the first, already opened, AccordionHeader.
Test Case:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<s:WindowedApplication xmlns:fx="http://ns.adobe.com/mxml/2009"
xmlns:s="library://ns.adobe.com/flex/spark"
xmlns:mx="library://ns.adobe.com/flex/mx">
<fx:Script>
<![CDATA[
import spark.events.IndexChangeEvent;
protected function accordion_changeHandler(event:IndexChangeEvent):void
{ trace("change"); }
]]
>
</fx:Script>
<s:Accordion id="accordion" change="accordion_changeHandler(event)">
<s:AccordionContent label="Tab 1" selectedWidth="200" selectedHeight="200">
<s:CheckBox/>
</s:AccordionContent>
<s:AccordionContent label="Tab 2" >
<s:CheckBox/>
</s:AccordionContent>
</s:Accordion>
</s:WindowedApplication>
Actual Results:
