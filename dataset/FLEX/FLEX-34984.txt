Summary:
for-each loops cross-compile incorrectly
Description:
When you write a for-each loop, the iterable gets re-evaluated on every iteration.
Example code:
for each (var item:Object in Test.getItems()) {
 Test.doSomething(item);
}
Cross-compiled:
  for (var foreachiter0 in Test.getItems()) 
  {
  var item = Test.getItems()[foreachiter0];
  {
    Test.doSomething(item);
  }}
It should not call Test.getItems() on every loop iteration. Instead, it should generate a new local variable prior to entering the loop to store the result:
var foreachiter0_target = Test.getItems();
for (var foreachiter0 in foreachiter0_target)
{
    var item = foreachiter0_target[foreachiter0];
    Test.doSomething(item);
}
I can see problematic code in three places:
JSGeneratingReducer.java: https://github.com/apache/flex-falcon/blob/develop/compiler.js/src/org/apache/flex/compiler/internal/as/codegen/JSGeneratingReducer.java#L3426
ForEachEmitter.java: https://github.com/apache/flex-falcon/blob/develop/compiler.jx/src/org/apache/flex/compiler/internal/codegen/js/jx/ForEachEmitter.java
JSVF2JSEmitter.java: https://github.com/apache/flex-falcon/blob/develop/compiler.jx/src/org/apache/flex/compiler/internal/codegen/js/vf2js/JSVF2JSEmitter.java#L1708
Another solution would be to use a for...of loop, Standard in ES6, though that won't work in Internet Explorer: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of
