Summary:
Compiling with static-linked Flex 3.5 automation tools causes memory leak on TextInput controls
Description:
To reproduce:
I've attached an example application that demonstrates the leak. I use a weak-keyed dictionary to generate an object instance list on some runtime-created title windows, each with a single TextInput as a child (this seems to be key). As the windows close, a strong-reference event listener is removed, allowing the weak key to be cleaned up, and the object list is updated to show which objects have yet to be GC'd.
If you compile without the automation libraries, everything GC's correctly.
If you compile WITH the automation libraries (specifically the automation.swc and automation-agent.swc libraries), the windows are never cleaned up.
1. Using the attached flex project, compile first with the default .actionScriptProperties file to see the correct behavior
2. Click the "Popup" button to generate TitleWindows. You'll see it added to the list in the background
3. As you close the title windows (click the "X"), the list in the background will update, removing the object that was removed.
4. Now compile with the default automation.actionScriptProperties (contains the statically linked automation libraries)
5. Follow steps 2 & 3. You'll notice the title window instances can never be GC'd. Profiling the
Expected Results:
Automation libs should not interfere with garbage collection
Actual Results:
Automation libs prevents GC on IFocusManagerComponents
Notes:
I believe this is due to a strong-ref event listener in TextFieldAutomationHelper.as on line 94. Changing this to weak allows the objects to GC correctly, but I haven't had a chance to test playback automation with it yet. I've also attached this diff as a patch.
