Summary:
Replacing item in Advanced Data Grid source collection when it's expanded causes RTE
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create an mx:AdvancedDataGrid and provide it with hierarchical data that has children.
2. Expand a node in the mx:AdvancedDataGrid.
3. Replace the item in the data provider that is expanded in the datagrid using the setItemAt (IList) method. Or dispatch a dummy Collection event of type CollectionEventKind.REPLACE.
Actual Results:
RTE with AdvancedListBase.
Error #1010: A term is undefined and has no properties.
at mx.controls.listClasses::AdvancedListBase/makeRowsAndColumnsWithExtraRows()[E:\dev\4.x\frameworks\projects\datavisualization\src\mx\controls\listClasses\AdvancedListBase.as:4000]
It seems the value of offscreenExtraRowsTop is set to -1.
Expected Results:
The item is replaced and view updated.
Workaround (if any):
There are a few work arounds:
1: Collapse the datagrid nodes (.collapseAll()) before replacing items in the collection. However you can't restore the expanded nodes afterwards, only expandAll().
2. Don't use setItemAt() and instead replace manually using .removeItemAt() and then .addItemAt(). This will trigger a CollectionEventKind.REMOVE then CollectionEventKind.ADD which doesn't cause the same problem.
3. Extend AdvancedListBase and override get or set verticalScrollPosition to stop a returned value being lower than 0.
There are a few other people that have noticed this bug, but don't seem to have reported it as it's quite hard to track down what was causing it. Mainly because the error occurs during the next validation cycle, so the stack trace offers little help.
