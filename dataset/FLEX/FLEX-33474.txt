Summary:
RichEditableText should support truncation if editing is disabled
Description:
Using Label/RichText is fine for truncation until you want text interaction (e.g., selection) and have to use RichEditableText.
One use case is if you wanted to display a URL and truncate after certain width. RichEditableText will wrap the entire text as necessary.
