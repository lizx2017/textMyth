Summary:
Identifcation of some objects while recording through QTP
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. We have one field in our flex application , that field name / lable name is "ABP/HP" and its a text box. In Our application, we have option to choose different projects.
So for one project we have this field name "ABP/HP" and for choosing other project, we have second field name as "Effort". In our application both are coming almost on same location in pop up box.
2.If we tries to record through QTP first field name "ABP/HP" and then "Effort". Both are identifying as same field in QTP but in application their name is coming as different.
3. Please suggest us to resolve this issue through QTP
Actual Results:If we tries to record through QTP first field name "ABP/HP" and then "Effort". Both are identifying as same field in QTP but in application their name is coming as different.
Expected Results: Both fields should show different object properties while recording.
