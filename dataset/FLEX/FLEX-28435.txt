Summary:
Spark Accordion: Order of selectedIndices changes automatically when set programmatically
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create an Accordion and set allowMultipleSelection="true"
2. At runtime set selectedIndices to [2,0,1].
3. In the attached swf, click Button "Set selectedIndies as 2,0,1".
Actual Results:
Read the value of selectedIndices and it shows as [0,2,1]. Basically, whatever be the value it moves 0 to the front.
This doesn't happen when multiple Accordion Content is opened using mouse clicks. Try this in the attached swf file.
Expected Results:
When reading selectedIndices it should read [2,0,1].
Order of selectedIndices should be maintained even when set programmatically.
Use Case:
A developer might use the ordering of selectedIndices to create custom Back\Forward or Up\Down control.
