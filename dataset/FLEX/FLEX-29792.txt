Summary:
Automation RTEs on startup when it encounters a display object that is declare private
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Declare a UI component as private, such as outside the package declaration
2. Run with AT turned on
Actual Results:
RTE in AutomationManager.createDelegate line 290, because it couldn't get an appDomain.
Expected Results:
No RTE
Workaround (if any):
Don't delcare the class private....but this isn't within someone's control all the time...often you could be using someone else's library code (as I was when I encountered this).
