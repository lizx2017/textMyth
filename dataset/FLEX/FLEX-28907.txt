Summary:
When trying to apply two - way - binding to a component property for different states the required functionality doesn't seems to work
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a DataGrid with a custom itemRenderer and add 3 custom states to this itemRenderer component
2. Add a checkbox into the itemRenderer and bind using two-way-binding feature the selected property of the checkBox to a specific "data" property for each state
3. Check to see if the current "data" object is changing when changing the "selected" checkBox property
Actual Results: The "data" properties are not changing according with the "selection" change on the checkBox component
Expected Results: The "data" properties should be changing according with the currentState and with the checkBox component
Workaround (if any): you must manually set the property of the "data" object on the checkBox onChange function according with the currentState of the itemRenderer
