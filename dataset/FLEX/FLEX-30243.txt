Summary:
QTP Object Spy identifies an empty value for a property modified in TEAFlex.xml file
Description:
New ticket was opened since FLEXENT-1168 was closed.
I have an additional question that goes along with configuring learned properties....assigning 'false' to the ForDescription attribute of a Flex object's property works fine. If this is done, QTP will not use the property when the object is learned/recorded. However, I also notice that after this is done, the Object Spy will pick up an empty value for the property.
For other applications, such as a Java, if you remove a property from the required properties list in QTP's Object Identification tool, QTP will no longer use the property to learn the object. But it will still pick up the property and its value when spying on it using the Object Spy.
Is there a way to do this with the Flex Addin? Instruct QTP not to use a property when learning a Flex object, but continue to pick up the property value when spying on it?
