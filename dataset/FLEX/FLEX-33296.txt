Summary:
Apache Flex Mavenized SDK Bug
Description:
Mavenizer creates a main directories poms for use in the new scope "import", but the contain of those poms are wrong in reference with the structure position expected.
SDKGenerator
The position of i.e.: framework-4.6.0.23201.pom implied this expected GAV:
<groupId>com.adobe.flex</groupId>
<artifactId>framework</artifactId>
<version>4.6.0.23201</version>
<packaging>pom</packaging>
however the contain of pom file is:
<groupId>com.adobe.flex.framework</groupId>
<artifactId>framework</artifactId>
<version>4.6.0.23201</version>
<packaging>pom</packaging>
And it's overwrite when is deployed over remote Nexus.
SDKDeployer:
I got a newer error too when I revised the deployment result on Nexus and find another issue too, a lot of artifacts was deployed with a wrong name or in a wrong structure position.
