Summary:
selectedCells property is not working correctly
Description:
This program, basically, searches a string in the whole datagrid. And then select the searched cells. I wrote a searched function that returns an array exactly in the same format of selectedCells' array. Then I assign this array to the selectedCells and the call validateNow() function of grid. But after that contents ( even length as well ) of both the array are different. ( This does not happen on any kind of a search rather You have to follow some steps to produce these bug ).
I am also tracing the lengths of both the arrays after every search.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Select 'Gender' from the comboBox, type 'a' in the TextInput control and then press Search button. It will select every cell in the Gender column.
2. Now select '(All)' from the comboBox, type 'a' in the TextInput control and then press Search button. It will select every cell in the Gender column except the 1st one. and 1st three cells of the Country column.
Actual Results:
after 2nd search all cells in 'Gender' column are selected except 1st one.
Expected Results:
after 2nd search all the cells in 'Gender' column should be selected.
