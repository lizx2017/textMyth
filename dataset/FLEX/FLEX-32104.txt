Reopen FLEXDMV-1692
Description:
Please reopen FLEXDMV-1692
I am very dissapointed with Sangavi Gururaghavendran . Firstly hwe should have not closed the case without my input and secondly I can confirm the contradiction from what he is saying and what is published on your website.
My main point here is, on your website, http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/upgrade/ you state that in Flex 3 SDKm the charting component is available for this flex 3 SDK.
Charting components Yes Full No Yes
What is the point of downloading the trial version, if it is not for us developers?
I await your speedy reply.
