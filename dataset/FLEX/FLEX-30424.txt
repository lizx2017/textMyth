Summary:
QTP Run time loading - only the run time loading app is visible to QTP 10
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Using http://xxx/RunTimeLoading.html?automationswfurl=http (or https)://xxx/app.swf
2. OR http://localhost/RunTimeLoading.html?automationswfurl=http (or https)://url/app.swf
3. OR https://xxx/RunTimeLoading.html?automationswfurl=app.swf (runtime loading in same location as web app)
4. Try and record or spy with QTP
Actual Results:
QTP 10 only sees the FlexApplication("app") object - does not see any of the embedded swf objects
Tried with our own deployed apps and Flex 4 swf apps found on web (such as spark inc)
First time with flex4 version of runtime loading on flex 4 app - never had issues with flex 3.4
The parent level is normally Browser->FlexApplication (ignore the window->winobject in the screenshot, that was a local malfunction at the time the screenshot was taken)
Expected Results:
Objects in embedded app should be visible to QTP
Workaround (if any):
RunTimeLoading works only if RunTimeLoading app and embedded app deployed on my own local machine
