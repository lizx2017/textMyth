Summary:
When using multiple Series types in a ColumnChart, columns render off-center
Description:
See the Adobe Flex documentation:
http://livedocs.adobe.com/flex/3/html/help.html?content=charts_formatting_10.html
Notice that the columns are off-center. For example, look at 17-Aug-05. Notice that it's slightly to the left in it's category. I.e. the center of the bar is not aligned with the point in the line.
The column renderer is making room for a 2nd "ghost" column because they are using series.length to leave space for all of the items in the series. This means the lines don't center in the tops of the column bars as they should, making the chart appear broken. We can't use this.
