Summary:
Text value of Text input component is not displayed if runtime(Captive runtime) is bundled along with the application
Description:
(Taken from originally logged runtime issue
Problem: Text value of Text input component is not displayed if runtime(Captive runtime) is bundled along with the application .
I have two swf file, one compiled with slightly older Flex SDK (4.5.2 Build #21681)and other complied with latest Flex SDK(4.5.2 Build#22243). If we bundle the runtime along with the application (Captive runtime), the swf which is compiled with latest Flex SDK doesn't show the text input value while the swf compiled with older Flex SDK behaves correctly.
Method:
1.Run the below adt commands:
a. adt -package -target apk-captive-runtime -storetype PKCS12 -keystore "Certificate-Path" -storepass "password" Main.apk Working-app.xml Working.swf
b. adt -package -target apk-captive-runtime -storetype PKCS12 -keystore "Certificate-Path" -storepass "password" Main.apk NotWorking-app.xml NotWorking.swf
2. Deploy the generated apk on the android device.
Result:
1. On deploying apk generated from first command displays the text input value.
2. On deploying apk generated from second command does not displays the text input value.
Expected:
On deploying apk's generated from command line should display the text input value.
Workaround:
change the skin of TextInput to "spark.skins.spark.TextInputSkin"
Note: There is change in swf version between two swf files attached.
