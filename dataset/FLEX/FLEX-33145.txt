Summary:
swfobject.js and expressInstall.swf are missing in the swfobject folder
Description:
1. download and install the tool availabe at http://people.apache.org/~bigosmallm/installapacheflex/
(Version used 0.7.8)
2. Run the application
What is Expected: It is supposed to download and package Apache SDK for use with Flash Builder. Once done, we should be able to create the Flex apps in Flash builder and run it on a browser
Whats actually happening: We are unable to run the flex applications on any browser. This is due to the missing files namely swfobject.js and expressInstall.swf in the folder <Apache sdk location>/templates/swfobject
Workaround: copy the missing files manually from Flex SDK 4.6 (bundled with Flash builder) into <Apache SDK location>/templates/swfobject
