Summary:
How QTP distinguish Pop-ups dialog boxes in AdobeFlex?
Description:
Hi there,
We can not distinguish which Pop-ups are displaying in Flex even though they have unique IDs for each Pop-ups. Here is a Flex example that I created to demonstrate this issue.
Here are the steps to re-create this issue.
1. Copied the following files to your web logic server from the attached zip file. Source codes are included if you want to recompile the main.swf file.
i. main.swf
ii. RunTimeLoading.html
iii. runtimeloading.mxml
2. Go to the main.swf through your browser. (ex. http://YourServer:YourPortNumber/ RunTimeLoading.html?automationswfurl=main.swf)
3. Launch QTP with Flex-Addin (we currently use QTP 9.5 with 3.02 FlexAddin)
4. QTP >> click on the Record button
5. IE >> Click on "Launch PopUp Window 1" button close it and "Launch PopUp Window 2" button.
Actual Results:
You can use Popup window 2 objects from QTP to recognize the Popup Window 1 object on the GUI
Expected Results:
You Should not able to use Popup window 2 objects from QTP to recognize the Popup Window 1 object on the GUI
Workaround: Use child objects to recognize each popups but it creates performance issue as well as a lot of work on handling all 100+ popups.
Would you please provide a solution to resolve this issue?
Also, on the side note, if you click on the "Launch both Popup Window 1 and 2" buttons, QTP could recognize both Pop-ups correctly.
Thank you.
Kelvin
