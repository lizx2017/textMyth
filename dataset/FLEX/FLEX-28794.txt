Summary:
Soft keyboard effect should be delayed until mouse up
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run the attached project on Android
2. Tap Open
3. Tap in a TextInput
4. If the keyboard does not show auto correction immediately, type into the TextInput to show the auto correction (which causes a keyboard resize)
5. Press and hold the close button in the pop-up
Actual Results:
Pop-up moves and resizes due to a keyboard ACTIVATE height change. The user is unable to complete the button click without sliding down to the button's new position.
Expected Results:
Stable pop-up position until mouseUp.
Workaround (if any):
put buttons at the top of the callout.
