Summary:
RadioStations crashes within a few seconds on Android when scrollbars are present
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Install either of the two attached apks - the release and debug versions of the RadioStations app
2. Run it
Actual Results:
It scrolls for a couple seconds then vanishes. When I run it in the debugger, same thing happens, no RTE, it just goes down.
Expected Results:
Should work.
Workaround (if any):
None
Additional Info:
This appears to have started in the first run in 4y after this checkin was made - the checkin was 22406 and we haven't had a successful run of RadioStations since then.
Ingo says it does not happen in GPU mode, but he's also seeing it in CPU mode since it was merged into the ultra_perf branch
