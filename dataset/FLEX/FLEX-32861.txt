Summary:
Performance issues in ADG
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a Value Object having 25 fields with combination of Number, String & Date types.
2. Configure a Editable ADG to accept an ArrayCollection of the value object. Use the 'GroupingCollection2' object to create a summary row (operation=SUM, placement=[last, same column]) for at least 5 of the data fields.
3. Read the data from an XML file to display at least 600 rows on the ADG.
Actual Results:
a. The Vertical scrolling & Horizontal scrolling is slow and sputtering even without any itemrenderers.
b. Rapid Cell Editing (Excel-like editing columns on the same row by using the tab key) is slow presumably because of the summary row recalculation and horizontal scrolling issues.
Expected Results:
a. What I'm looking for is 'smooth' scrolling on both the Vertical and Horizontal.
b. Rapid Editing should not take time. (I have observed on the source code that Flex is recalculating the summary row for all the columns (across all the rows) rather than only for the column on which I'm editing.)
Workaround (if any):
NONE.
