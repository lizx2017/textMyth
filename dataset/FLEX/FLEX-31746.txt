Summary:
Valid Chart license doesn't remove watermark for AdvancedDataGrid
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create MXML Application with an AdvancedDataGrid control
2. Run it
I've also edited the license.properties file in the Flex Builder 3\sdks... directory to force the re-entry of the license keys by setting the firstLaunch property to false. Even though the Flex Builder 3 Activation dialog validates the licenses to be valid, the watermark doesn't disappear.
Actual Results:
The watermark "Flex Data Visualization Trial" appears across the AdvancedDataGrid.
Expected Results:
No watermark
