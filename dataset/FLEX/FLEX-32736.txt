Summary:
[Mirroring] layoutDirection, when set at the series level is confusing, with wrong datatips being shown
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a flex project using sdk 4.1.0.14484
2. Copy the attached mxml file (LayoutdirectionAtSeriesLevel.mxml)
(Note: In the attached mxml file, the layoutDirection is set at the series level.
when set at series level, we can specify different layout direction for each series. )
3. Compile and run the app
Actual Results:
The datatips are not showing the data for the series on which the mouse is pointed over. Its more confusing than useful for the user to specify layoutDirection at the series level.
Expected Results: User should not be allowed to set this style at the series level.
