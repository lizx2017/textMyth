Summary:
The problem is that Responder of createXXX() method in a Flex project is never invoked.
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1.Make a MDD data model graph. The graph includes two entities. One entity is Company, and the other is Employee. The relation is One-to-Many.
2.Start the browser e.g. Firefox and input the "http://127.0.0.1:4502" in the address bar. Then we input admin/admin to log in the CRX.
3.Input some contents into the two TextInput controls. Click the "Create" button to create Company Object. (Call the createItem method to create a Company Object.)
4.Then we click the "Commit" button to excute the following code:
var ctoken2:AsyncToken = employeeservice.createEmployee(employe1);
ctoken2.addResponder(new AsyncResponder(successHandler, errorHandler));
(We make a new Employee object employe1. And we call the employeeservice.createEmployee(employe1) method to create AsyncToken.Then we call the addResponder)
P.S. This is Dean Harmon's proposal that we should report the bug in JIRA and it is a bug with SDK.
Actual Results:
No matter whether it is successful excuted or fail excuted, successHandler() or errorHandler() is never invoked.
Expected Results:
If it is excuted successfully, successHandler is invoked. If it is a failed execution, errorHandler() is invoked.
