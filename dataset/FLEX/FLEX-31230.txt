Summary:
UP and DOWN keys should have no effect when chart contains only one series
Description:
Reproduction:
1. have a chart with only one series
2. select any item and use UP and DOWN keys
Actual Results:
Selection moves to first or last item
Expected Results:
Selection should not change
Excel behaves similarly. Also when we have multiple series pressing UP takes to next series so keeping this behavior will be confusing. It is also duplicate for already existing HOME/END keys
