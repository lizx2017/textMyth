Summary:
I am having AD with more than 50 columns created at runtime. I am adding records at runtime to the ADG... As my records increases, horizontal scrolling in ADG becomes slower and slower. This creates a performance issue in the ADG..
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Add more than 40 columns in the advanceddatagrid
2. Add more than 10 records
3. continue adding more records
Actual Results:
Horizontal scrolling in Advanceddatagrid is becoming slower and slower..
Expected Results:
It should not slowdown the scrolling
Workaround (if any):
We can add scrollbar to the container of advanceddatagrid but it also scrolls header and footer of the advanceddatagrid.
So can not use.
