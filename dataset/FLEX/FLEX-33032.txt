Summary:
TypeError: Error #1010 on ADG get firstVisibleItem when a unrelated byteArray write happens
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1.Create an application with a ViewStack
2. Create a flex module with a ViewStack with an ADG in all the views, keep the dataprovider of datagrid as empty array (length == 0).
3. Inside one of the view of parent application ViewStack, load the module created on step 2 into a child ApplicationDomain of parent application
4. Do any operation on the main application that triggers ByteArray.writeObject(new Object)
Actual Results: Run time exception occurs
TypeError: Error #1010: A term is undefined and has no properties.
at mx.controls::AdvancedDataGrid/get firstVisibleItem()
at ObjectOutput/writeObject()
at mx.collections::ArrayList/writeExternal()
at mx.collections::ArrayCollection/writeExternal()
at flash.utils::ByteArray/writeObject()
Expected Results: Object should be written into the byte array in AMF serialized format
Workaround (if any): Instead of having a null dataprovider ArrayCollection or of 0 length, atleast have one element with blank values on the dataprovider
This issue seems to have been reported multiple times at

It doesn't seems mandatory to use ByteArray write, operation that call it indirectly have been reported to have same outcome
