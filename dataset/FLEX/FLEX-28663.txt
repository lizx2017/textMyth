Summary:
Missing SoftKeyboardEvent ACTIVATING and ACTIVATE on Honeycomb when long pressing on empty text field
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run the attached project on a honeycomb tablet
2. Press the Open button to open a callout
3. Press and hold on the TextInput (StageText) at the top of the Callout to bring up the context menu to paste
Actual Results:
ACTIVATING and ACTIVATE events are missing (the app is configured to log events in the Callout's TextArea). Note that dismissing the soft keyboard will log a deactivate event in the TextArea. Normal (not long-press) taps on TextInput will log events in the TextArea as expected.
Expected Results:
Press-and-hold (long press) gestures should still fire soft keyboard events when the soft keyboard is raised.
