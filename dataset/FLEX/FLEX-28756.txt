Summary:
Validators do not show red errors around input boxes when compiled with Flex 3 compatibility mode
Description:
Validators are not working correctly when compiled with Flex 3 compatibility mode. No red errors are shown around input boxes even when the Validator determines the input to be invalid.
The attached repro has a NumberValdiator for a TextInput field.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Compile Flex4_Test.mxml in FlashBuilder 4.5 (using Flex SDK 4.5.1) with the compiler option "Use Flex 3 compatibility mode" selected.
2. Run the application and type a character value in the input field. No red error is shown around the input box.
If instead you compile with the compiler option "Use Flex 3 compatibility mode" turned off, then the Validator works as expected.
