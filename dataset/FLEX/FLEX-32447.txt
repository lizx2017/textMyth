Summary:
cubeBuildingTimer is null
Description:
Occassionally when calling refresh repeatedly, this error pops up:
TypeError: Error #1009: Cannot access a property or method of a null object reference.
at mx.olap::OLAPCube/buildCube()[C:\Work\flex\dmv_automation\projects\datavisualisation\src\mx\olap\OLAPCube.as:608]
at flash.utils::Timer/_timerDispatch()
at flash.utils::Timer/tick()
For some reason, the cubeBuildingTimer is null when trying to call stop on it. It would be a simple fix to update the code to check if the timer is null or not before trying to call stop on it.
