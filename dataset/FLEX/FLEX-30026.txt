Summary:
QTP is taking too much of time to find and fire events on FlexImage and FlexLabel controls located in FlexCanvas
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Drag a Advertisement (this is FlexLabel) on to Metro news paper page (FlexImage located in FlexCanvas) and Drop it.
2. Two steps are recorded in QTP(9.2/ 9.5/10.0) i.e a Drag event and a Drop event
3. Execute the two steps
Actual Results: Taking around 70 steps to execute the two steps.
Expected Results: The recorded two steps should be executed in reasonable time which should be around 2-5 seconds
Workaround (if any): Tried all available possibilities ( Using Other Events to drag and drop as Mercury.DeviceReplay and Window.Drag and Drop; and Descriptive programming ) but could find any solution
Please refer the attachement.
