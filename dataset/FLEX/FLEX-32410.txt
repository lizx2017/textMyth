Summary:
validPreviousPage returns false when it should return true
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Compile the attached application. I'm using FlexBuilder 3 with update 2. It's using the 3.2 SDK included with FlexBuilder.
2. Click on the 'Preview Document' button
3. Click the 'Next Page' button until repeatedly until you reach the end of the document
4. Click the "Previous Page" button until you get to page 2, note that you cannot get back to page 1 because the Previous Page button is now disabled. The enabling/disabling of the next/previous page buttons is ultimately delegated to the PrintAdvancedDataGrid.
Actual Results:
You can't get back to the first page of the document. This also happens with the validNextPage button occasionally in similar circumstances.
Expected Results:
You can get to the first page of the document.
Workaround (if any):
After calculating the total number of pages (using validNextPage until getting to the last page), ignore what validNextPage and validPreviousPage return.
