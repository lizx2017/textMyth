Summary:
PieChart SeriesInterpolate Effect Does Not Remove All Callout Labels When DataProvider Changes
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create an application with a PieChart with a SeriesInterpolate Effect that is triggered by "showDataEffect" (compile attached code).
2. Update the dataProvider source (i.e. Change one of the positive values zero using by editing the value in the DataGrid).
Actual Results:
Callout labels are displayed incorrectly. Sometimes duplicate labels are shown. Sometimes labels of removed items are shown.
Expected Results:
Callout labels should reflect the series items only.
Workaround (if any):
Do not use SeriesInterpolate effect.
