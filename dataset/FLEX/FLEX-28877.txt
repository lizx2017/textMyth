StageText: setFocus() is ignored when a bitmap is swapped in
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Load sample application. This opens a popup with a TextInput, and attempts to set focus to the TextInput upon opening.
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<s:Application xmlns:fx="http://ns.adobe.com/mxml/2009"
xmlns:s="library://ns.adobe.com/flex/spark" applicationDPI="160">
<fx:Declarations>
<s:SkinnablePopUpContainer id="popup" width="300" height="150" open="ti.setFocus()">
<s:TextInput id="ti" left="10" top="10" right="10" />
<!-- s:TextInput id="ti" left="10" top="10" right="10" skinClass="spark.skins.mobile.TextInputSkin" / -->
</s:SkinnablePopUpContainer>
</fx:Declarations>
<s:Button label="Open PopUp" left="15" top="15" click="popup.open(this)" />
</s:Application>
Actual Results:
Focus is not set.
Expected Results:
Focus.
Workaround (if any):
Wait before setting focus. The problem is there is no way to know how long to wait.
