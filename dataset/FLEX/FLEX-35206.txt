Summary:
Javascript isn't produced correctly when beads are not the first element of View
Description:
    <js:View >
 <js:Container height="320" width="721" style="border:1px solid">
 </js:Container>
 <js:beads>
  <js:ViewDataBinding/>
 </js:beads>
         <js:Label text="something"/>

</js:View>
Above code doesn't report error when building to html/javascript, but when running it doesn't show the label control.
In awf mode it runs without problem.
There could be other unexpected behavior when bead is not the top element and the UI has more elements or files:
Sometimes it build but when running it stop in javascript error. Sometimes it builds but after the normal building process the SDK reports "javascript" building error. I could not reproduce them with simple sample for now
