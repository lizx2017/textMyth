Summary:
FalconJX is not creating a getter function for MXML-declared objects.
Description:
Create (or use a FlexJS example) and give an id to an MXML component in the MyInitialView.mxml file:
<basic:Label id="firstLabel" text="First Label" />
In the same file, reference the component by its id in a script block:
<fx:Script>
private function doSomething():void
{ var label:Object = firstLabel; }
</fx:Script>
Now compile this with FalconJX into MyInitialView.js. Inspecting the MyInitialView.js you will find:
var label /* type of Object */ = this.get_firstLabel();
Unfortunately, there is no get_firstLabel() function generated by FalconJX.
