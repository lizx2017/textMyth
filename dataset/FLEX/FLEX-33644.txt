Summary:
XMLEncoder improperly handles encoding the string "null".
Description:
The following code returns an empty string:
var enc:XMLEncoder = new XMLEncoder();
enc.encode("null");
However, SchemaMarshaller.marshall() correctly returns the string "null".
I believe the problems is that XML.appendChild (as used in XMLEncoder.setValue) for some reason treats the string "null" differently. I have no idea why.
If you're curious as to why I think this is a bug, see this StackOverflow question:
