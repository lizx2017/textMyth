Summary:
HierarchicalCollectionView keeps using old openNodes when new dataprovider is set
Description:
To reproduce:
1. Put hierarchical data in a datagrid, expand some nodes
2. Put a new dataprovider in the datagrid
=> the HierarchicalCollectionView still has the old openNodes
3. Make it do something with the openNodes, for example do a refresh on the dataprovider
=> it uses data from the old dataprovider on the new one
See attached example, with MyHierarchicalData, a trivial IHierarchicalData implementation that makes the problem more clear.
Start it, open a node, click on "switch dataprovider", and next on "refresh" => MyHierarchicalData.getChildren is called with a node from the previous dataprovider.
(The same thing happens with a GroupingCollection, but there it doesn't go wrong in such obvious ways).
Workaround: Set HierarchicalCollectionView.openNodes to null every time a new dataprovider is set.
I'm not sure about the "Found in Version" field here; we're using Flex 3.1.0.
