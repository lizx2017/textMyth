Summary:
Advanced Data Grid openItems has been removed.
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Import an application that has an AdvancedDataGrid component and uses the openItems array from Beta1 to Beta2
2. Try to compile the code
Actual Results:
Compiler Error:
1119: Access of possibly undefined property openItems through a reference with static type mx.printing:PrintAdvancedDataGrid.
Expected Results:
Compiles Cleanly
Workaround (if any):
None
I believe this to be a bug because the Flex 3 language reference lists the openItems array as a property of the AdvancedDataGrid. I blelieve this array ought to be re-instated because it allows the user to write code and routines that are tied to the items open in a hierarchical grid. I use it to print only those groupings in an adg that are open.
