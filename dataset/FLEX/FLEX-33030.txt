Summary:
Vertically scrolling an AdvancedDataGrid with custom ItemRenderers results in a corrupted display and a possible memory leak.
Description:
Steps to reproduce,
1. Run the attached ADGItemRendererIssue.mxml
2. This initially displays an AdvancedDataGrid with all rows visible.
3. resize the ADG so that not all of the ADG is visible vertically, and the verticle scrollbar is shown. In the example attached the ADG is in a split panel, so the split bar can be dragged up to conceal some of the rows and display the scrollbar.
4. drag the scroll thumb all the way to the top of the scrollbar, and all the way to the bottom and back to the top several times.
5. Resize the ADG again so that all the rows are visible.
Actual Results:
there are what appear to be extra rows printed numerous times on top of one another in the middle of the ADG.
Expected Results:
ADG doesn't have a corrupted display.
Workaround (if any):
No workaround found.
From further investigation into this, it would appear that new ItemRenderers are being created constantly as the scroll thumb hits the top of the scroll bar, and when the ADG is resized again so that it is fully visible. The old ones aren't seemingly being collected, and could be the cause of the corrupted display you can see in the middle of the ADG when you expand it.
In the provided code the 'count' variable is a static on the ItemRenderer class and will increment whenever a new renderer is created. The current value is assigned to that instance of the item renderer, and is set as part of the label text as a way of tracking the particular instance of the renderer that's being used.
