Summary:
QTP does not record repeaters present inside a container which is present in a title window
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1.Use the attached mxml files.
2.Click on recording in qtp and click on the button to open the title window.
3.Now click on therepeater components
Actual Results:QTP does not recorded repeater component clicks
Expected Results:QTP shpuld record the repeater clicks
Workaround (if any):
The parent changing needs to be done for the direct child/(ren) of the repeater.
So please the change of the repeater related code in the titlewindow.mxml as follows
<mx:HBox>
<mx:Repeater id="rp" dataProvider="
{dp}
" >
<mx:HBox id="hb1"
creationComplete="hbox_creationCompleteHandler(event,hb1)" >
<mx:Label id="t1"
text="Click
{String(rp.currentItem)}" />

<mx:LinkButton id="b1"
label="{String(rp.currentItem)}
"
click="Alert.show(String(event.currentTarget.getRepeaterItem()) + ' pressed')" />
</mx:HBox>
</mx:Repeater>
</mx:HBox>
and provide the implementation of hbox_creationCompleteHandler(event,hb1) as follows.
protected function hbox_creationCompleteHandler(event:FlexEvent, la:Array):void
{
if(la && la.length && ((la[0] as HBox).owner != rp.owner))
{
for each (var a:HBox in la)
{ (a as HBox).owner = rp.owner; }
}
}
