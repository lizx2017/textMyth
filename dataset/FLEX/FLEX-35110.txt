Summary:
Flex based component using FileReference Upload API fails with 400 Bad Request for multi upload scenario because of missing boundary conditions
Description:
We have developed a component of multi file upload using flex sdk 3 using FileReference Upload built in functionality.
However we have encountered that the upload fails for more than two files over slow transmission networks.
On further investigation We found that the flash is resulting in I/O Errors during the retrieval of total bytes being uploaded for display in the upload progress with the log information as displayed below
==============================================
388956 AVMINF: MTHD flash.events::ProgressEvent/get bytesLoaded ()

IOError Event : Dispatched when the upload or download fails.[IOErrorEvent type="ioError" bubbles=false cancelable=false eventPhase=2 text="Error #2038: File I/O Error. URL: <<http based Post URL>>
=============================================
Due to this error the POST request is resulting in Bad Requests on the Web Server because of the missing boundary closures which are required to complete the POST request.
This issue is always replicable on slow networks which are hovering around 100Kbps
Request you to look into it and do the needful to provide a fix which needs to be incorporated as one of our customers are critically affected with this functionality miss.
