Summary:
DataGrid no longer updates columns for typicalItem set at runtime
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run the attached SWF or compile and run attached MXML file
2. Click the "setVariableRowHeight" button
3. Click the "setTypicalItem" button
Actual Results:
With variableRowHeight = true, the DataGrid does not update the width of the columns to match the new typical item
Expected Results:
Column width should be updated to match the new typicalItem. Note, a DataItem matching the new typicalItem is visible in row 4. Columns should be resized to fit that data.
