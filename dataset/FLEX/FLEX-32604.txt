Summary:
LinearGradient doesnt work when plot values are equal.
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. I've attached the sample code to use
2.Update the data provider arraycollection so that the Profit plot values are equal:
public var expenses:ArrayCollection = new ArrayCollection([
{Month:"Jan", Profit:1000, Expenses:1500, Amount:450}
,
{Month:"Feb", Profit:1000, Expenses:200, Amount:600}
,
{Month:"Mar", Profit:1000, Expenses:500, Amount:300}
]);
Actual Results:
Linear gradient does not work at all when the plot values are equal. See screenshot Gradient_Working.jpg
Expected Results:
Gradient should still work when the values are equal. See screenshot Gradient_broken.jpg
Workaround (if any):
I can not find any workaround for this
