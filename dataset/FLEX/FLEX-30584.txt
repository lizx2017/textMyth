Summary:
Charting extractor installs source in the wrong directory
Description:
Reproduction:
1. Put a valid charting serial number in frameworks/license.properties
2. chdir to the Flex root directory
3. Run this:
java -jar lib/charting-source.jar frameworks frameworks
(The last argument that command line is the destination directory, which the user typically wants to be "frameworks".)
Actual Results:
Extracts the charting source to <destdir>/source – that is, frameworks/source.
Expected Results:
Should extract the charting source to <destdir>/projects/charts/src – that is, frameworks/projects/charts/src given that above command line. In Flex 2.0.1, frameworks/source was the right place, but in Flex Moxie, all source is under "projects/<projectname>/src".
By the way, this also reproduces within Flex Builder, if you go to Help > Manage Flex Licenses, and enter a valid charting serial number.
Workaround:
Manually move it (but most developers are not going to know to do that).
