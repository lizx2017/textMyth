Summary:
Not able to identify flash components where wMode is set to opaque / transparent using QTP
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Launch site which has flash file where the wMode is set to opaque / transparen
2. Use QTP to identify the flex controls in the flash.
3. The entire flash object is identified as webelement
Actual Results:
The flash component is identified as a single Web element.
Expected Results:
It should be possible to identify the individual flex controls in the flash page
Workaround (if any):
If the wMode is set to window, it is working fine. But we want wmode as opaque. By changing this mode to window, some other functionality is getting affected. So, we need a solution for this issue.
