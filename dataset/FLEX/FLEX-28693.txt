Summary:
After close() method has been called on the popup, showFirstViewNavigatorInPopUp doesn't work properly
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create an application with SplitViewNavigator.
2. Open the callout by calling showFirstViewNavigatorInPopUp method on SplitViewNavigator.
3. Call viewNavigatorPopUp.close() method to close the callout, instead of hideViewNavigatorPopUp.
4. Call showFirstViewNavigatorInPopUp again.
Actual Results: Popup contains the wrong view navigator (second one).
Expected Results: Calling close method directly isn't proper workflow but some developers may try to do it.
