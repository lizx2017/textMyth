Summary:
Setting includeInLayout to false in a SpriteVisualElement does not invalidate the parent size
Description:
Setting includeInLayout to false calls the invalidateParentSizeAndDisplayList method. But there is a check
if (!includeInLayout)
return;
That causes the parent size to not being invalidated.
It could be easily fixed by removing the check or moving the invalidation code directly into the includeInLayout setter
