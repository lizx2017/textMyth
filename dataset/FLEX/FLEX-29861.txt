Summary:
DataGrid Header Click problem when column is hidden
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Hide a column (visible = false) in a datagrid display.
2. Call the HeaderClick() method using the index of the hidden column, using a third party tool such as Borland SilkTest.
Actual Results:
The header is clicked on the next visible column instead of the hidden column. The index count is off by 1 after the hidden column, so that calling HeaderClick(numColumns) results in an error.
Expected Results:
Either the hidden column header is clicked, or nothing happens; either way, nothing should be visible to the user.
Workaround (if any):
There is no workaround, as there is no way to check at runtime whether there are hidden columns.
