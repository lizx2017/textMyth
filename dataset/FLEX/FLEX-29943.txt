Summary:
Empty Alert showing up in recording and replaying
Description:
During my recording and replay, there is an empty alert showing up here and there.
Anyone know what caused it? Screen shot and trace are attached.
Workaround (if any):
In replay, I can add wait 40 line to wait long enough then this alert doesn't show up in some places, but this doesn't work for all places.
