Summary:
Scroller.ensureElementIsVisible() no longer scrolls keyboard focused elements into view.
Description:
This bug was introduced with revision 22262 which merged changes from 4.y revision 22216 into the trunk
I've uploaded a sample project to demonstrate the issue.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Import the attached Scroller.ensureElementIsVisible project into FlashBuilder
2. Compile the project against 4.y or the trunk after revision 22262
Actual Results:
Tabbing through the controls with the keyboard will not scroll items receiving focus into view.
Expected Results:
Tabbing through the controls with the keyboard should scroll items receiving focus into view.
Workaround (if any):
I've attached a patched version of spark.components.Scroller for reference.
The change is at line 1486:
// Do not snap vertically when increasing the
// verticalScrollPosition for the soft keyboard
snapContentScrollPosition(true,
(getStyle("interactionMode") == InteractionMode.TOUCH
&& !adjustForSoftKeyboard));
We should only worry about whether or not the soft keyboard is present in InteractionMode.TOUCH.
