AdvancedDataGridBaseEx.itemToLabel() seems to refer outside displayableColumns array when there are more hidden columns on the left of the sort column than visible columns on the right.
Expected Results:
Letter B should select the second row.
Workaround (if any):
Haven't found a good workaround so far.
