Summary:
QTP 9.5 not recording events with the flexstore sample web application
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1) Install QTP 9.5
2) Installed Flex 4.0 Plugin. (We will be able to see the Flex addin after installing this plugin.)
3) Installed Adobe Flash Player 10,1,53,64. (Confirm this by launching url "http://www.adobe.com/software/flash/about/")
4) Installed Flex Builder 4. (I installed this when QTP failed to identify the objects after the above 3 steps)
5) Launched QTP & application url "http://examples.adobe.com/flex2/inproduct/sdk/flexstore/flexstore.html"
Actual Results:
1) While recording, no scripts are generated. Object Spy is identifying the objects as Winobject
2) While spying the objects are being identified as winobject.
Expected Results:
1) While recording scripts needs to be generated
2) While spying the objects needs to be identified correctly
Comments:-
I have referred the attached documentation and realized that the TEAPluginIE.dll is not getting loaded. I have enabled all the options available in the security tab for all zones(now my computer is of very low security) and rebooted the system.
All my activex addins in the manage addons screen (Including the Shockwave (Flash Player)) is enabled. I am using IE7. Any special setting needs to be done in IE7? Is there anyway to force load this dll by force?
I have enabled QTP logs and confirmed that the text "Read Flex environment and matching ProgId"TEAPluginQTP.TEAFlexAgentQTP" is appearing in the QTP logs. No exceptions found in QTP logs.
I have also enabled Flash Player logs and dont see any exceptions in that.
