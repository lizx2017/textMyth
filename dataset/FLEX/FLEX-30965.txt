Summary:
DateTimeAxis: should change the minimum number of labels to accept a time frame.

Reproduction:
Currently, DateTimeAxis decides on 2 as the minimum number of labels to accept a time frame. This can make for some strange looking charts. We should raise the magic number to something larger, perhaps 4 or 6.
Load swf.

2 labels

More labels.
