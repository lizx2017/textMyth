Summary:
Absence of dataFunction property from OLAPMeasure
Description:
We need to programmatically generate OLAPDataGrids using a custom dataProvider. Without a dataFunction capability for OLAPMeasure it is impossible to implement, and as such is a serious show-stopper for us.
It does seem bizarre that OLAPAttribute enables a dataFunction but OLAPMeasure does not.
