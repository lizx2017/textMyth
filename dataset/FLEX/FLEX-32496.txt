Summary:
Multiple series, multiple data providers with different record count in each data provider does not render the chart
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
Refer to the attached mxml application.
I have 7 series and 7 data providers. 3 of them have 2 records and 4 have 1 record. When I run the application, the lines are not shown in the chart.
I commented the series with single record data provider and the chart renders correctly.
Actual Results:
The chart takes the xField values from a single record dataprovider and assumes that there is only one value on the horizontal axis. The fact is that there are 2 values on the horizontal axis.
Expected Results:
The chart should show the trendlines no matter whether all the xField values in all the data providers are provided or not.
