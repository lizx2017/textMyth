Summary:
AdvancedDataGrid class constants break API rules
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. http://livedocs.adobe.com/labs/flex3/langref/mx/controls/AdvancedDataGrid.html#constantSummary
2.
3.
Actual Results:
[quote]
HEADERICONPART : String = "headerIconPart"
HEADERTEXTPART : String = "headerTextPart"
[/quote]
Expected Results:
API dictates that constants are separated by underscores (for example, ColorPicker's itemRollOut constant is "ITEM_ROLL_OUT" â€“ http://livedocs.adobe.com/labs/flex3/langref/mx/events/ColorPickerEvent.html#ITEM_ROLL_OUT)
So these should be "HEADER_ICON_PART" and "HEADER_TEXT_PART" to be consistent with the Flex API
