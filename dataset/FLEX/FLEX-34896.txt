Summary:
Null Error #1009 in mx.controls.DataGridColumn.as at line 1803
Description:
Working on upgrading an older application from Flex SDK 4.1 to 4.14 (was originally built on SDK 3.0 and migrated along the way without any massive refactors, very limited use of Spark) and only just started encountering this error. Does not happen with all of the grids in the app but have had no success in tracking down why some of them are behaving differently. We do have the grids extended heavily making wholesale conversion to Spark time consuming and problematic.
At line 1803 there is an attempt to get data[field] with no null checks on data. Somehow it is getting here while data is null causing this error.
typeof(null) == "object" returns true.
Following stack trace was hand typed if there are any typos (impossible to copy stack or any code from other machine, have not been able to make a test app that recreates the problem)
