Summary:
JSON.stringify is not working with object marked by Bindable
Description:
FlexJS is using JSON.stringify to produce json from value objects.
Two general issues has been discovered during development:
1) "stringify" function is not able to parse object which is marked by [Bindable] tag
Description:
In the attached example there is class Book which is marked by [Bindable] tag. During parsing we are getting stack trace:
Uncaught TypeError: Converting circular structure to JSON
    at JSON.stringify (<anonymous>)
This happened cause compiled VO object contains additional properties which "stringify" is not able to parse. (book_js_with_bindable.png)
2) there are differences between swf and js sight in results of parsing by "stringify" function
JSON.stringify SWF:
{
    "authors":["Kitten","Puppy"],
    "date":"Wed Apr 19 14:00:50 GMT-0500 2017",
    "doNotHide":99,
    "page":0,
    "title":"Trump",
    "topic":{"name":"Politics"},
    "dedication":"Lucy"
}
JSON.stringify JS:
{
     "topic":{},
     "internalDate":"2017-04-19T21:30:27.959Z",
     "title":"Trump",
     "date":"2017-04-19T21:30:27.959Z",
     "authors":["Kitten","Puppy"],
     "_dedication":"Lucy"
}
Expected results:
1) We should be able to parse object with [Bindable] tag without any issues
2) SWF and JS stringify function should produce exact same json results.
Proposition:
In order to avoid issues above VO should contains "toJSON" function.
Example class with toJSON function:
[Bindable]
public class Book
{
        public var title:String;
        public var page:int;
        public var date:Date;
        public var authors:Array;
        public var topic:Topic = new Topic();


        public var doNotHide:uint = 99;
        private var internalDate: Date = new Date();

  private var _dedication:String;

        public function get dedication():String
        {
            return _dedication;
        }

        public function set dedication(value:String):void
        {
            _dedication = value;
        }

  public function toJSON(k:String):Object
  {
   return {title: title,
    page: page,
    date: date,
    authors: authors,
    topic: {name: topic.name},
    doNotHide: doNotHide,
    internalDate: internalDate,
       dedication: dedication};
  }
 }
