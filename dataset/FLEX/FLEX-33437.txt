Summary:
Embed image with compression=true causes artifacts around transparent edges (like a halo)
Description:
In Flex, if you embed a PNG image, you use the following tag:
[Embed(source="compressionbug.png")]
Unfortunately, the image is compiled into a raw bitmap, which is much larger than the source PNG. In order to solve this, you typically add the compression parameter:
[Embed(source="compressionbug.png", compression="true")]
This solves the filesize issue, but there's a bug that occurs with some images with transparency.
This image, for example:
http://content.madefire.com/jira/CompressionBug/originalimage.html
will cause the problem to occur if compression is true.
Here is the Flex page that exhibits the halo around the image edges:
