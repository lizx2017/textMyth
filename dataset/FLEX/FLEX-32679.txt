Summary:
Data doesn't show, when AdvancedDataGridColumnGroups are generated at runtime.
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create an array, with some ADGColumnGroups
2. Create an ArrayCollection with an object, with variables corresponding to the ColumnGroups columns dataField property value.
3. Add an mxml ADG with propeties: groupedColumns = array and dataprovider = the arraycollection
Actual Results:
Can't see values
Expected Results:
Can see values
Workaround (if any):
None
Additional information:
The problems seems only to be visual, because if you add a column not within a group, to your columns array, and it has the same dataField property as one within a columnGroup, and you make the ADG editable="item", you can actually change the value, of the field you can't see, and se that reflected in the field you can see...
Maybe it doesn't make much sense, but please se my attached example code + swf.
