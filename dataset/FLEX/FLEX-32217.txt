Summary:
OLAP API might return un expected results when querying both (All) attribute and a non (All) attribute
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. run the attached example
2.
3.
Actual Results:
Look at the data grid result, the (All) row contains the same data value as the "JViews" row, while if you look at the data in the sample, the (All) row should contain (JViews) + (Elixir) so bigger values.
Expected Results:
Values should be different
(by the way if you uncomment line 143 in the sample to add "Elixir" to the query in addition to (All) & "JViews" suddenly everything works fine.
