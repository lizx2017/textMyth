Summary:
Correct language in README
Description:
From Bertrand :
... in the README: "This hash is compared with the hash from the
Apache Flex SDK release site - If they match, we verify that the
downloaded binary file is a valid Apache release...". Binaries are not
Apache releases, so you shouldn't say that. I'd change it to something like
"the md5 digest of the downloaded file is compared with one obtained from
the apache.org website, and the installer aborts if they don't match".
