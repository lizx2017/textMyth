Summary:
hyperlinks don't work in spark text in certain conditions
Description:
When a non-editable text flow contains one centered paragraph containing a hyperlink, the hyperlink does not function in the 4.5 SDK. Adding a blank paragraph after the centered one can help in some cases, but doesn't fully fix the problem. See attached source file for a demonstration.
