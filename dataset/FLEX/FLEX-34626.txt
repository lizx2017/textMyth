Summary:
Flash Builder 4.5 premium license is not getting recognize by automation SWCs
Description:
Issue:
Our production is blocked by this bug. The scenario is we are having Flash builder 4.5 premium and our product is compiled with Flex sdk 3.6. When we compile our product with automation libraries and try to record/replay, after 30 steps, a popup comes saying that our product is compiled with trial version.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Install Flash Builder 4.5 premium with valid Premium license.
2. Create a new Flex 3.6 sdk application.
3. Compile the application with automation swcs
(-locale en_US -include-libraries "${flexlib}\libs\automation.swc" "${flexlib}\libs\automation_agent.swc" "${flexlib}\libs\automation_dmv.swc")
4. Run the application.
5. Record with QTP/FlexMonkey/Custom Agent. Record more than 30 actions.
6. Replay the script.
Actual Results:
A message is shown saying that License not present. With the trial version only limited records are allowed.
Expected Results:
The premium license should be recognized by the automation agent.
