Summary:
PMC RDF needs to use asfext:pmc, not asfext:PMC
Description:
The asfext DOAP extension PMC data documentation [1] was clarified recently, as there was some historic confusion over whether the property name should be in upper or lower case.
It has now been confirmed that lower case should be used [2].
There are a few PMC data files which currently use upper case; your PMC is one such.
Please could the project change "asfext:PMC" to "asfext:pmc" in the file? There will be two such references.
Thanks.
