Summary:
Empty Callout loses explicit size after orientation change
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run the attached FXP that uses a Callout with an explicit size but no content
2. Press the Callout button to open the callout
3. Rotate to portrait or landscape
Actual Results:
Callout is resized to zero.
Expected Results:
Callout explicit size should remain.
Workaround (if any):
See attached patches (.patch file and full .as file). The issue here is SkinnablePopUpContainer incorrectly erasing explicit sizes when no soft keyboard effect resize was ever applied.
Also, if the Callout is not empty, it will take on it's content's measured or explicit size instead.
