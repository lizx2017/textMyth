Summary:
508 Issue - JAWS reads wrong column when AdvancedDataGrid is in singleCell selection mode
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create an AdvancedDataGrid, populate it with data, and set selectionMode="singleCell".
2. Navigate the grid using JAWS.
3. Profit.
Actual Results:
JAWS reads the data for the previous column. In other words, if you have selected a cell in column 2, the data from column 1 in the same row will be read. It should be noted that aDesigner shows the correct data.
Expected Results:
JAWS should read the data from the cell you have selected.
