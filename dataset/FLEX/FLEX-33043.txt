Summary:
Exported charts won't work in certain folders
Description:
My exported charts won't work depending on where I move the bin-debug folder.
They work if I move it from my workspace:
C:\Users\Flexer\Adobe Flash Builder 4.5\charts\bin-debug
to my desktop:
C:\Users\Flexer\Desktop\bin-debug
But not if I move it to:
C:\Users\Flexer\Desktop\test\bin-debug
or
C:\bin-debug
What's going on?
