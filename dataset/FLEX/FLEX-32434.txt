Summary:
Datatips do not honour application's scaleX or scaleY, so chart is scaled but not the tips
Description:
Similar to #SDK-19578, the DataTip that appears when the user mouse overs a data point does not scale when the application's scaleX or scaleY is updated.
This means the chart is scaled up (or down !) but the data tips appear in their original size.
