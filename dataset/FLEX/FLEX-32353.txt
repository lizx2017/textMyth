Summary:
AdvancedDataGrid's expandAll method is VERY slow
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run the attached Application (ADGExpandAll.mxml). The application creates an ADG with a GroupingCollection data provider, whose source is an ArrayCollection that contains 800 objects. Those objects are grouped into 100 groups. So there are 100 groups, with 8 children in each group.
2. Click Expand All button, which internally simply calls AdvancedDataGrid.expandAll function. After expandAll returns, a label will appear that shows how many milliseconds the operation took.
Actual Results:
The entire application freezes for more than 11 seconds on my Intel Core 2 Duo T7700 @2.40GHz.
Expected Results:
The rows should be expanded very quickly without freezing the UI. The operation should appear instantaneous to the user.
Workaround (if any):
None
Notes:
1. I use Flex Builder Pro 3.0 (build 3.0.194161)
