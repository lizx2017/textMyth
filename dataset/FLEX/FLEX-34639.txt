Summary:
osmf.swc file name case problem
Description:
Under Linux, I get the following error building my app:
command line: Error: unable to open '/opt/apache-flex-4.13/frameworks/libs/OSMF.swc'
The file that exists in that location is lower case "osmf.swc".
In 4.12 it worked. In Windows, which is case insentive, it works.
Doing a search in the sdk installation directory, in 4.13 there are lots more references to upper case "OSMF.swc" than in 4.12.
I suppose it is a problem of consistently naming the file in lower case (in the flex-config files?).
