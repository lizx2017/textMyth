Summary:
Fill style not applied to Line series
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a columnChart with multiple series; in my case, I am creating three column series and three line series.
2. Apply same fill color to one column series and one line series; that is apply three colors, one color to each column and line series
I have attached the sample code for your reference
Actual Results:
First problem:
fill color is applied to three columns and two lines correctly, but the last line series created do not get the color. It is displayed in its own color.
Second Problem:
If line series is created after column series, the fill color style is ignored for all line series.
Expected Results:
The fill color style should apply to all line series, irrespective of when it is created
