Summary:
Data binding between AdvancedDataGrid and data source is not syncronised
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Build an adg with some grouping (2 phase grouping in mine). The datagrid has 3 number fields. A non editable constant value, B editable number value, C is calculated by A*B. The adg has event listeners (i tried any i could click, datachange, itemedit..) to recalculate the values of datasource.
2. When a value in B is changed the event listeners triggers my calculation function and all values are calculated and set to datagris as expected.
3. However the adg is not updated after the datasource's data changed. If another field is updated and the calculation triggered again now it displays the values expected to be seen before but not the latest calculated ones.
Actual Results:
The grouped adg is not syncronised with it is datasource. Changes are not reflected to cells. The first update can be seen on datagrid when the second update occurs (but the second can not be seen)
Expected Results:
Since the datasource updated the adg should also be updated.
Workaround (if any):
None, even regrouping doesnt seem to work.
