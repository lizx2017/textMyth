Summary:
SDK 3.4 regression: Module cannot be automated
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Compile and run attached sample application.
2. Click "Button in main App". Notice how an error message is output to Flex Builder console: "Failed in getting the definition or the class or getting the delegate. Automation will not work for this component. TestModule"
3. Attempting to use RIATest toolbar to Inspect the "Button in Module" has no effect. The new module is not visible to automation.
Recompile the application with SDK 3.2 or 3.3 and repeat the above. Everything now works as expected, no error message is output to console and "Button in Module" can be inspected.
Additional information. The error message about failure to get definition of the class is printed when newly created module object is attempted to be added to the canvas in main application using addChild() call.
