Description:
Focus can be transferred from a modal window to a non-modal window open in the background if clicked ONLY on some specific dimension of the non-modal window in the background i.e. by clicking on the extreme left i.e. x=0 dimension of the application. Issue varies with flash player versions and browser used. The non-modal window is coded to listen to a click event.
However it can be easily reproduced with any browser or flash player version by setting the x dimension of the non-modal window between-10 to 0
