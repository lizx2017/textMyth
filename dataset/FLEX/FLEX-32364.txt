Summary:
Weird scrollbar behaviour in ADG
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. create an ADG with lots of columns and rows
2. set it's width and height to 100%
3. set it's horizontalScrollPolicy and horizontalScrollPolicy to "auto"
(see my attached demo for the complete code)
Actual Results:
The ADG has the vertical and horizontal scrollbars even though the ADG's width is large enough to contain all data. The horizontal scrollbar show only because the vertical scrollbar is visible. Scrolling is only possible because the ADG's parent shows scrollbars too. However, the ADG is not useable, since the column header disappears sometimes which results in rows / cells that aren't selectable anymore.
Expected Results:
The ADG should be as wide and as high as it's parent (e.g. 100%) and only the ADG should display the scrollbars - not it's parent. Moreover, the ADG shouldn't display a horizontal scrollbar if there's no need to or just because there is a vertical scrollbar.
Workaround (if any):
See my attached demo. I had to put the ADG into a container so that I could set the ADG's width and height to an explicit pixel value:
width="
{container.width}
" height="
{container.height}
"
