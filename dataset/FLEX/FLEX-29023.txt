Summary:
BitmapImage scale9Grid + smooth
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Embed a bitmap asset
2. Create a BitmapImage mxml tag, set smooth="true"
3. Create a Sprite
4. Create a Bitmap
5. Instantiate the bitmap asset onto the newly created Bitmap's bitmapData property
6. Add the Bitmap as a child of the sprite
7. Set a scale9Grid on the sprite
8. Set the sprite as source of the BitmapImage
9. Set the width of the BitmapImage to more than 100% of the embedded image (so it scales)
Actual Results:
Scale9Grid is applied because of the DisplayObject (Sprite), but smoothing is ignored.
Expected Results:
Should scale and remain smooth after
Workaround (if any):
