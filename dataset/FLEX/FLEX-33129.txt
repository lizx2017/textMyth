Summary:
Refactor ZenTheme.FLA to single-frame symbols
Description:
The Zen theme in samples/themes/Zen cannot be re-factored into FXG files because the FLA file is still comprised of multi-frame symbols. It appears that when the flex_skins.swf was originally created, the author started with the multi-frame symbols and re-factored them but forgot to save the re-factored FLA.
Apache requires that we be able to generate the theme swc from source without requiring tools that cost money so we are unable to include the Zen theme in the release at this time.
The steps to resolve this issue would be to take the multi-frame symbols and factor each labeled frame into a separate symbol and hopefully use the naming scheme and stage layout used in the Arcade or Graphite themes. Once the FLA is updated in this way, I will take care of creating the FXG files from the FLA file.
The ZenTheme.FLA files (and the Arcade and Graphite FLA files) are now in the repository in the external folder (https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/flex/external)
