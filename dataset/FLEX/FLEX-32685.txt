Summary:
DataTipRenders overlapping on multi-data point.
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
Mouse over the multi-data point that uses the custom data tip renderer. Screen cast of bug: http://screencast.com/t/OTMwODI0ZD
Actual Results:
Data tips overlap one another and obscure their contents. This appears to be a Flex 4 issue. I tested similar code with flex 3.5 and I could not reproduce the bug.
Expected Results:
Data tips should be appropriately spaced apart with no overlap.
