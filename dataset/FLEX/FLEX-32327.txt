Summary:
[Bug Report] 3 depth advancedDataGrid not working properly
Description:
From a customer...
------------------------------------------------------
I developed a flex applications that shows a 3 depth advancedDataGrid. The structure of the application is:
An application with an advancedDatagrid and an array that is the datasource.
An advancedDataGrid for the datagrid of depth 2.
And advancedDataGrid for the datagrid of depth 3.
The array is very simple:
private var masterData2:Array = [
{nombre:"andrés",apellidos:"muñetón" }
,{nombre:"diana", apellidos:"arredondo",
children:[{hobby:"lectura", peliculas:"aventura", children:[
{libros:"crimen y castigo", autor:"dostoievsky"}
]}]
when I execute the application, it shows the first and second levels right, but it only shows the headers of the 3 level, not the data.
I debugged the application, and I found that the atribute data of the advancedDataGrid of depth 3 has the data that I want to show. But the datagrid doesn't show it. I have tried putting data directly in the the datasource of the datagrid of the level 3 but the result is the same (only headers).
If I replace the advancedDataGrid of depth 3 by the advancedDataGrid of depth2, the data is showed. The problem is only for the level 3.
I tried with an xml as a dataprovider and the 3 levels are showed correctly.
I developed the application in Adobe Flex Builder.
