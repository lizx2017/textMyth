Summary:
LineSeries with mixed large&null values hangs Flash Player
Description:
Description:
When mixing line series containing a large number with another line series, that include a null value, Flash Player hangs.
Run following code to see the bug:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<mx:Application xmlns:mx="http://www.adobe.com/2006/mxml">
<mx:LineChart>
<mx:series>
<mx:LineSeries dataProvider="{[
{x:0, y:null}
]}" />
<mx:LineSeries dataProvider="{[
{x:0, y:100000000}
]}" xField="x" yField="y" />
</mx:series>
</mx:LineChart>
</mx:Application>
Note:
The bigger the "large" number is, the longer is the hang. On my computer, when "large" value is around 10000, it takes a few seconds until Flash Player is responsive again. Larger values give much longer hang.
Actual Results:
Browser CPU usage jumps to 100% for a long time and, in result, Flash Player practically hangs.
Expected Results:
Chart works normally, without the hang
Workaround (if any):
none found.
