Summary:
Small, near-zero independent values cause the Line Chart to cause the flash player to crash.
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1.Create a set of data to chart with values less than 10 raised to the -40 power.
2.Attempt to bind data to a LineChart or set the min/max values of the LinearAxis to the min and max
of the set of data
Actual Results:
Flash player freezes and then crashes.
Expected Results:
A line should be drawn on the chart. Or, if the chart axis cannot handle the small values, an error should be thrown.
Workaround (if any):
Test the difference between the min and max values, if the difference is less than 10 raised to the -10 power, manually set the axis minimum value to the floor of the data minimum value and set the axis maximum value to the ceiling of the maximum data value.
