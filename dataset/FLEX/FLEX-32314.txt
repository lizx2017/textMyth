Summary:
Certain characters are (visibly) doubled when displayed in AdvancedDataGrid
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create Advanced Datagrid (one column is suffcient)
2. Add an itemRenderer for the column based on mx:TextArea, mx:Text or mx:Label
3. The itemRender's style properties need to be set to...
fontFamily = "Courier New"
textAlign="left"
4. Set the column's headerText proterty to "1234567890"
Note: Courier New is a monospaced font. so one would expect that all characters of this font take the same width when displayed
Display following data for each row in the grid:
"AB ▄▄" (2 x ▄ = U+2584 Lower Half Block )
Actual Results:
You will find the displayed DataGrid looking something like this
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 (Header)
A B ▄▄▄▄ (Data)
The width of ▄ does not match the rest of the characters (AB). it looks like as if the number of ▄ effectively doubled
See also the attached screen shot which illustrates the different character width.
Expected Results:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 (Header)
A B ▄▄ (Data)
