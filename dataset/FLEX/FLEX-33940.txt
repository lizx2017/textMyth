Summary:
Double binding triggers when visual component is unlinked from parent
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Import, compile and run the attached project.
2. Press the button
Actual behaviour: A custom error is thrown, showing that the setter has been called.
Desired behaviour: The setter is not called, and the custom error is not thrown.
Notes:
"this.testCheckBox = null" triggers the two-way binding and calls the setter with 'false', although the checkbox was selected before it was removed from stage.
in our application these bindings trigger wrong values to get set in TOs, which sometimes translates into wrong values in the database. And this happens when we're clearing view references to each other and to their children, which should be independent of data linkages.
