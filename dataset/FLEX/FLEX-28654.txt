Summary:
Taps on iPad cause mousedown/up animation but click event isn't triggered
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Import the FXP available at: http://probertson.com/resources/temp/ipad_click_issue/ipad_click_issue.fxp (8.1 MB)
This is just a simple master/detail app with a TabNavigatorApplication, a TabNavigator containing a List and a view
2. Build the project and export for iPad
3. Install the ipa on iPad
4. Click a list item.
5. Click the back button
Actual Results:
When I'm "deliberate" in steps 4 and 5 they always work. However, when I'm "casual" – that is, when I use the app the way I use any iPad app that I'm familiar with – a notable percent of the time I see the mousedown and mouseup state changes but the navigation that's supposed to happen in the click event handler isn't actually triggered. (Also sometimes I don't even see the state change.)
You can see a video of me interacting with the app here:
http://probertson.com/resources/temp/ipad_click_issue/index.html
A good place to see the back button issue is the 16 second mark and 30 second mark
A good place to see the list item issue is the 45 second mark
(The issues happen a few times throughout the video, so you can see more instances of both issues throughout.)
If you want to watch it offline, you can download the video and it's HTML wrapper here:

One guess about what's happening is that when I'm "casual" my finger triggers then mousedown then moves off the item or back button enough that the rollout event occurs, just as I'm lifting up my finger.
