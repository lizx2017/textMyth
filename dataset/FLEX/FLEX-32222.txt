Summary:
AdvancedDataGrid row height issue - with variableRowHeight=true, vertical scroll just goes from one row to another and does not scroll within a row if a row's height is greater than the height of the grid
Description:
With variableRowHeight=true and wordWrap=true, if the text in a cell is longer than the height of the grid, it gets cut off and is not scrollable
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run the attached swf file.
2. The second row that has a lot of text in it has the height more than the height of the grid.
Actual Results:
Scrolling vertically in the grid cuts off the content at the height of the grid. Scrolling further simply goes to the third row instead of showing the rest of the text
Expected Results:
Scrolling vertically show scroll through the row showing all the text in the cell before moving to the next row
Workaround (if any):
Adjust the column size to be big enough so that the row height is less than the height of the grid. Note this is not always possible because (a) under 1024x768 resolution, text looks bigger and even a few lines of wrapped text can make the row bigger than the grid size (b) data can be large thus making the row bigger
