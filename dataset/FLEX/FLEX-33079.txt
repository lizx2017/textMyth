Summary:
Edit versionCode in manifest
Description:
I am using Flex 4.6 from Adobe to create APK files - while bundling the APK is not creating VersionName correctly.. It's doing -
<manifest android:versionCode="1000000" android:versionName="@string/app_version" android:installLocation="auto" .....
I need a number in the versionNumber rather an identifier.. Is there any way I can set a specific number?
I am not able to publish the app because of the newly generated manifest with 4.6. It produces the right manifest with flex 4.5 but I am now using new features of 4.6 and trying to publish to market.
Any help would be appreciated.
Thanks,
Akhil
