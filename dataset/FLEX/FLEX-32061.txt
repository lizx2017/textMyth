Summary:
AdvancedDataGrid not issuing or responding to automation events
Description:
Steps to reproduce: in build 189825
1.Send a select automation event to an Advanced Data Grid, or
2.Send a selectIndex automation event to an Advanced Data Grid, or
3. enable recording of automation events and manually select a row in an AdvancedDataGrid, or
4. enable recording of automation events and manually select a column header in an AdvancedDataGrid
Actual Results:
No events are sent from the AdvancedDataGrid with recording enabled. No effect when sending select events to an AdvancedDataGrid.
Expected Results:
I would expect it to perform much like DataGrid in that it should support automation for testing.
Workaround (if any):
Use DataGrid.
