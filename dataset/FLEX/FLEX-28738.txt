Summary:
Spark Accordion: If effect is interrupted, destruction policy is applied prematurely
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Make the Accordion transition really slow in a custom skin.
2. Make sure the first AccordionContent is selected.
3. Click the second AccordionHeader.
4. Before the second AccordionContent is done opening, click the first AccordionHeader.
Actual Results:
The second AccordionContent's children will get wiped out.
Expected Results:
The second AccordionContent's children should not get wiped out until it's completely closed.
Workaround (if any):
None, but I have an idea for a fix.
