Summary:
lineSegmentRenderer is not working properly for one data point in LineChart
Description:
Steps to reproduce: The condition was to create a line graph when there is only one data point. So we decided to show a point or dot or box. For that we used the property as
lineSegmentRenderer="components.MyRenderer".
For deatils please see the attached project.
1. Open the source project and run it in debug mode with toggle break point on renderer class "MyRenderer".
2. When one data point is selected the debuggers doesn't refer the lineSegmentRenderer, however it refers to LineSegment when more than one datapoints are there.
3.
Actual Results: This should go to MyRenderer everytime. This works fine in Flex sdk 2 but not on 3.2.
Expected Results: This should work correctly on version 3.2.
