Summary:
"Editable" Advanced Data Grid when using horizontal scroll and dynamic dataProvider for ComboBox doesnt show itemEditor
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create "editable" AdvancedDataGrid with enough columns to get horizontal scroll and few combo boxes
2. Use horizontal scrollbar to scroll right and when clicked on Combo editor, in itemFocusIn event,
dynamically set dataProvider (data may come from server)
Actual Results:
Combo editor is partially visible or fully not visible. When fully not visible, A white patch is shown overlapped on column at the left . There is no way to choose items except to use key-down/up to select items from invisible Combobox. Also, a wierd background water mark is displayed (see attachment).
Screenshot (attachment2) was taken when clicked on "OrderType" column cell - it displays patch of
ComboBox (with no values) overlapped on Destination column(column on left).
Overlap(on left-column) issue happens even for TextInput Editor when scrollbar is used in some cases.
Expected Results:
Combo editor to show the dropdown with values in data provider in correct cell position.
