Summary:
Slower touch scrolling performance for very tall lists
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run the attached project on a tablet
2. Inspect FPS for each test case (Callout w/ no masking, ViewNavigator as a pop-up, List inline, Callout w/ masking)
3. Change orientation landscape<->portrait and repeat
Actual Results:
In portrait, where the lists are very tall, FPS degrades quickly.
Expected Results:
Consistent list performance. In portrait we're pushing more pixels of course, but I'm seeing somewhere between 3-6 FPS drop for each test case.
The main driver here is the SplitViewNavigator use case where the Callout appears in portrait with the firstViewNavigator which typically contains a long list for primary navigation. My initial thinking was that CalloutSkin's contentGroup masking (also found in CalloutViewNavigatorSkin) or blendMode="layer" was causing the degradation, but I believe these 4 use cases side by side might prove me wrong.
