Summary:
myService.commit of multiple new rows to DataGrid not refreshing correctly when data is added / changed at the server CFC end. (Only refreshes the first one of the new rows)
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1.Follow the example http://help.adobe.com/en_US/Flex/4.0/FlexTutorials/WSbde04e3d3e6474c4292a0331216558354b-8000.html#WSbde04e3d3e6474c4-211e6e7c12846356a0c-8000
2.Make changes to the createItem and updateItem in the CFC so that it changes the values / adds new ones on insert / update.
3.Use the myService.commit function to insert the new records. As per the example.
3.Those new values are not displayed in the Grid even with a dg.dataProvider.refresh(); call or even re-assigning the dataProvider.
4.If a button is added with a dg.dataProvider.refresh(); then the grid is refreshed corrrectly.
Actual Results: The grid is not refreshed correctly with any server end changes.
Expected Results: The grid should refresh with all changes including those made at the server end
Workaround (if any): Added a refresh button - not good for users as I was using a custom renderer to depict rows that had not been saved. Using one of the return values to identify if the rows have been saved.
I really like the dataManagement features and need this to work with ColdFusion.
