Summary:
License problem when using automation libraries / No proper documentation on the subject
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1) the automation swc files were taken from
...\Adobe Flash Builder 4\sdks\3.5.0\frameworks\libs
2) The SWF file was compiled with the parameter (sample license number)
-licenses.license flexbuilder3 aaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeee-ffff
3) Starting QTP and recording a test from the Flex application works but after about 30 clicks a message pops up with the following text: "License not present. With the trial verison only limited records are allowed."
Another attempt was done to compile with a flashbuilder 4 license (below) in step 2) but it lead to the same result in step 3).
-licenses.license flashbuilder4 aaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeee-ffff
Actual Results:
Test reoording with QTP works but is blocked with a popup complaining about the lack of license.
Expected Results:
No limitation because of the license.
Workaround (if any):
No workaround available. Tests cannot be automated.
