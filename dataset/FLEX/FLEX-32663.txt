Summary:
PrintAdvancedDataGrid dataProvider null for an Hierarchical dataProvider
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a PrintAdvancedDataGrid
2. set the dataProvider with an Hierarchical dataProvider (put lot of data to have more the 1 page)
3. call validNextPage
Actual Results:
validNextPage return false and only 1 page is printed
Expected Results:
validNextPage return true and all pages are printed
Workaround (if any):
We can call validateNow() manualy to force commitProperties otherwise we will have only one page printed.
Because the dataProvider is Hierarchical, it is set only in the commitProperties, so we can't use validNextPage right after setting the dataProvider.
