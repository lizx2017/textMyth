Summary:
AutoScroll does not works when Drag/Drop happens in ADG .
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Drag an item from List 2 to List 1 and try to drop on the last row.
2. As the last row is not visible , the feedback [shadow] should see the Auto-Scroll moving in vertical direction
down so that one is allowed to drop to the position which was not visible.
3. Auto Scroll does not happens as expected and I can't drop the item at the position beyond the currently visible
rows.
Actual Results:
Auto-Scroll does not happens
Expected Results:
Auto-scroll should happen automatically like it happens in other ListBased controls such as TileList , DataGrid [I have tested] but strangely not happens with ADG.
Workaround (if any):
NA.
Tested Versions :
SDK 3.2 ----- FAILS
SDK 3.5 ----- FAILS
SDK 3.6 ----- FAILS
SDK 4.0 ----- FAILS
and in ALL SDKS , it works for DataGrid but fails for ADG.
