Summary:
each time you drag a component wit Label in it, it couse BitmapData memory leak
Description:
Lately i started to testing my application with Adobe Scout and it turns out i got a memory leak in dragable panel. Which is a spark Panel with added functionality to drag it. And now when i drag it Adoby Scout shows tat the memory is going up when I move the spark Panel.
After fatter investigation it turns out that memory is caused by
"rendering FTE Text"
and the memory is allocated to Bitmap > Other Bitmap Memory and is not Garbage Collected.
Solution yo dis was to set
cacheAsBitmap = true;
to all Labels used in the Panel
or set cacheAsBitmap = true to the whole Panel before i started to drag it and turn that of when i stooped drag.
But when i look at the code i got also masked list. And when i change the size of mask to show whole list all the itemRenderers with Label in side them cause the memory going up also. Also the Labels in the Button component.
So i gues this is a major FTE leak.
