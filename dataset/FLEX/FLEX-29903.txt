Summary:
SPY on AdvacnedGrid can cause browser and system to hang
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Open my app and navigate to the page where AdvancedGrid is displaying
2. Bring up QTP Object SPY and spy on the dropdown item inside the grid, the one under Line # from screen shot
Actual Results: The browser + QTP + SPY will hang untill you kill the browser.
Expected Results: The object inside the AdvancedGrid is highlighted.
If you need to check on the app, please arrange time so that I can visit your office, and VPN from there to access my app. The app is huge, I don't have the luxury to generate any samples. Any help is appreciated.
Thanks
Chian
