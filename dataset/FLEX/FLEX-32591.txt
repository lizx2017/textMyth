Summary:
FB4: Can not compile project containing any chart (other than PieChart) using -locale set to custom language (created using copylocale utility) - PieChart works fine
Description:
Reproduced on Flash Builder 4 plugin (build 246332) on Windows XP SP3 and Mac OSX 10.5.5 using SDK 4.0
Eclipse 3.4.2 and 3.5
Steps to reproduce:
0. Create new language: c:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Flash Builder Plug-in Beta\sdks\4.0.0\bin\copylocale en_US en_CA
1. Create new Flex project for Desktop (ie AIR)
2. In design mode, drag/drop ColumnChart onto your project mxml file
3. Save and notice it compiles for en_US (You can also try any other lang that comes with FB4 and it also compiles fine: en_US, fr_FR, es_ES, it_IT, da_DK, de_DE, fi_FI, ja_JP, ko_KR, nb_NO, nl_NL, pt_BR, ru_RU, sv_SE, zh_CN, zh_TW)
4. Change locale to the newly generated language: en_CA (project properties->Flex Compiler->additional compiler args)
5. Compiler shows error:
Unable to resolve resource bundle "charts" for locale "en_CA".
6. Remove ColumnChart and replace with PieChart and save. Project compiles fine.
7. Try any other chart and you will encounter the same issue
Actual Results:
Compiler shows error:
Unable to resolve resource bundle "charts" for locale "en_CA".
Expected Results:
Project should compile and run without problems
