Summary:
HLOCSeries issue when data value is null, a zero is graphed
Description:
In Reference to FLEXDMV-751, it appears as though a bug very similar to this was closed, but I don't see the resolution or how to work around the problem.
Steps to reproduce:
1. vh_hlcgreek.mxml requests an xml document via an HTTP call.
2. tickdata.xml contains the data for the HLOC Series
Actual Results:
In this example, the Delta 1 series (orange on the graph) are incorrectly graphing zero's where there are no values for that series to graph. It appears to be similar in nature to several other bugs I've seen reported, but the resolution is not listed.
Expected Results:
HLOCSeries correctly graphs some series, but not all series.
