Summary:
Wrong MD5 entry in Flex installer config.xml
Description:
The installer keeps failing when trying to install playerglobal16.swc . In the http://flex.apache.org/installer/sdk-installer-config-4.0.xml is the wrong value. I downloaded the swc from the supplied link and checked the MD5 and it's different than the one in the xml file.
