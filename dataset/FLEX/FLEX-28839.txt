Summary:
Bad width and height for swf as included as InlineGraphicElement
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run the provided project
Actual Results:
The InlineGraphicElement doesn't care about the specified width. When we don't specified the width, the real width seems to not being correctly calculated.
Expected Results:
The swf animation would be between the "test" words with no overflow.
Workaround (if any):
Try to set a right padding but if the InlineGraphicElement has a background, the padding is blank... (and for my Chat, there is background )
This bugs occurs on Flex 4.6 too, and on TLF 3.0 too.
