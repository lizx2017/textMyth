Summary:
Changing ColumnSeries itemRenderer at runtime doesn't remove previous itemRenderer. All previous itemRenderers still get called.
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
NOTE - I don't know your version naming scheme (and can't find an explanation), so I picked DMV 3.0.x, which may be wrong. My Flex 3 SDK prompt says I have version 3.0.0 Build 477
ALSO - I attached 3 files. The bare-bones itemRenderers demonstrate the problem. To use - just keep selecting and unselecting the checkbox beneath the chart.
1. Create a ColumnChart (or BarChart) with a custom itemRenderer on a series. Place a breakpoint or trace statement in the renderer's updateDisplayList().
2. At runtime, switch to a different itemRenderer which also has a trace statement in its updateDisplayList().
3. Watch as both trace statements are called.
4. Keep switching itemRenderers and watch the trace outputs increase exponentially.
5. Put a breakpoint in the LayoutManager's validateDisplayList and note all the itemRenderer entries at the end of the invalidateDisplayListQueue.
Actual Results:
The invalidateDisplayListQueue grows, adding each new itemRenderer.
Expected Results:
Each time an itemRenderer is set on a ColumnSeries, it replaces the previous one.
Workaround (if any):
None.
