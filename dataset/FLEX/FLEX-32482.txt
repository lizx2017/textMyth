Summary:
Using ItemRenderer to display a pie chart throws a runtime error
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Use an itemRenderer in a DataGridColumn to call a Pie chart created as a component.
2. I got the source from this link. http://polygeek.com/1379_flex_datagrid_with_dynamic_charts
3. I modified the source to work in Gumbo, I have attached it here.
Actual Results:
At runtime, I get a TypeError: Error #1034: Type Coercion failed error.
Expected Results:
The chart should render. I tried the same code in Flex 3, and it works there.
