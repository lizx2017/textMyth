Summary:
PlotChart draws values which are not interactive when in between zero values
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a new Flex project in FlashBuilder
2. Replace the application's MXML content with the attached version
Actual Results:
The datapoint having y-Value 1 is drawn but is not interactive.
Expected Results:
The datapoint having y-Value 1 should react when hovering over it, should be clickable and should display a tooltip.
Workaround (if any):
-
Could be possibly related to FLEXDMV-1899. However the workaround suggested in this issues has no effect.
