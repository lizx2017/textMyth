Summary:
Using HTML Google StreetView on AIR
Description:
The only way to use google StreetView now is as html with api v3. The problem is that it doesnt work on any air html renderers. I already tried the mx.controls.HTML, HtmlLoader and StageWebView, but none of them works. Its betterfor me if mx:html worked, because I need to interact with flex on both ways, and its simpler with it.
Here is a simple example that loads a google streetview sample. Check the diferences by opening the link "https://google-developers.appspot.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/full/streetview-simple" on a browser and navigating on them. Thanks in advance!
