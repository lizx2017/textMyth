Summary:
DateTimeAxis ignores disabledRanges when using localToData or dataToLocal
Description:
Please check the attached file, It's very simple to reproduce :
_ Remove the disabledRanges curly bracket binding and the example works as expected ( the square exactly follow the mouse )
_ Re-add the disabled ranges and the example works incorrectly.
Thanks
