Summary:
ArrayCollection addItemAt() does not work correctly after removing sort
Description:
After sorting an ArrayCollection, removing the sort, then adding an item at an index always adds it to the end of the list. I ran into this while sorting a dropdown alphabetically, then setting the ArrayCollection's sort to null, and trying to add something at the top of the list, such as "Select One". This works fine in Flex 4.6.
Here is a simple example (and workaround):
var col:ArrayCollection = new ArrayCollection();
col.addItem("1");
col.addItemAt("2", 0); //works as expected
col.addItemAt("3", 2); //works as expected
col.sort = new Sort();
col.refresh();
col.sort = null;
//workaround:
//var temp:ArrayCollection = new ArrayCollection(col.toArray());
//col = temp;
col.addItemAt("0", 0);
