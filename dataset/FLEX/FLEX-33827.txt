Summary:
Flex4 mxmlc.bat and mxmlc.exe difference
Description:
When I upgrade flex3 to flex4, and use mxmlc.bat to compile, it has some warning for my old flex code. but if i use mxmlc.exe(flex_sdk_4.10\bin\mxmlc.exe) to compile, it will no warning. So who knows the difference between mxmlc.bat and mxmlc.exe in flex_sdk_4.10\bin folder? Thanks very much.
