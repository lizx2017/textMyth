Summary:
HierarchicalCollectionViewCursor cannot find sealed class instance
Description:
HierarchicalCollectionViewCursor.findAny() and HierarchicalCollectionViewCursor.findLast() return true for any values parameter that's a sealed class instance or the value null, even though they don't actually find that item, and end up setting the cursor's current property on the wrong item in the collection view.
I'm not sure if this causes bugs higher up the chain, but I imagine it does.
This bug has the same cause as FLEX-33058.
