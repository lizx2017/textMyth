Summary:
TextInput component with restrict property is not working with Samsung default keyboard
Description:
Problem Description: On a Samsung Galaxy SII, running Android 4.0.4 with it's Samsung default Keyboard, if the restrict attribute is set on a TextInput, the resulting text of user's input is not at all what he gets.
The text is partially overwritten with suggestions, or the prefix repeated on every char (making the text exponentially growing)
Applying spark.skins.mobile.TextInputSkin doesn't solve the problem.
Moreover, when TextInputSkin if applied, the softkeyboard doesn't show up at the first focus in event.
EDIT: also tested with the new spark.skins.mobile.ScrollingStageTextInputSkin. Same unexpected behaviour.
See attached project to reproduce.
Steps to Reproduce:
1 - Install attached project
2 - In each visible TextInput
3 - hit those letters on the softKeyboard: "a", "b", "c".
4 - Select "abc" suggested by Samsung's keyboard
5 - Repeat step 3.
6 - Repeat step 4, your goal is to write "abc".
7 - See what you have inside TextInputs
Actual Result:
Default TextInput, with default Skin: "abc abc" -> OK
Restricted TextInput with default Skin: "abcabcabcabcabcabc" -> totally NOK
Default TextInput with TextInputSkin: "abc abc" -> OK
Restricted TextInput with TextInputSkin: "ababc" -> NOK, one "C" is missing!
Expected Result:
In all TextInputs: "abc abc"
Any Workarounds:
Write word char by char.
