Summary:
CSS PI: Wrong default for BarChart's horizontalTickAligned (And possibly others)
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a CSS file and add style rules for BarChart{} and List{}
2. In Design View, select BarChart and press the Edit button next to "Grid lines"
3. Select the List{} style rule, then repeat step 2 (this is necessary to work around FLEXDMV-1173)
4. In the PI, check the "Horizontal Tick Align" checkbox
5. Uncheck it
Actual Results:
4. No change
5. Grid lines move, even though the checkbox now matches its original setting
Expected Results:
Checkbox should start out already checked, since this is the default.
Workaround (if any):
None.
