Summary:
Flex does not set imeMode back to the previous value when the control loses the focus.
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
0. Prepare Japanese IME in Windows.
1. Run MainSpark.swf with Flash Player 11.1 or later.
2. Click in the first TextInput of which imeMode is unspecified.
3. Click in other TextInput of which imeMode value is different from current one.
4. Click in the first TextInput of which imeMode is unspecified again.
Actual Results:
The value of imeMode is not set back to the previous one. It remains the same.
Expected Results:
The value of imeMode should be set back to the previous one. Halo TextInput in Flex 3.x SDK works correctly with Flash Player 10.0 or older. (However this behavior has been changed since svn 8574.)
