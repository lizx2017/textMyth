Steps to reproduce:
1. An application with a panel and inside a list with several items. The panel can be collapsed horizontally with by using a fade effect first to fade out the content of the panel and then resizing the panel to like 5 pixels.
2. collapse the panel
Actual Results:
the list is hidden, but on the location of the list is now a white box which overlaps the border of the collapsed panel. This happens at random, sometimes the white box isn't there and sometimes it is.
