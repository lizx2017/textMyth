Summary:
ArgumentError: Undefined state 'normalAndInactive'.
Description:
I haven't had time to dig deep into this, but thought I would point this out as I know there's talk of an RC.
We have a rather large AIR project that has 4 mobile apps and a desktop app (all sharing core libs). When I tried the nightly build last night, the mobile apps work fine but I get the following error.
This happens immediately on launch and the AIR Window doesn't open up. In 4.13 everything works as expected.
Sorry for the lack of details but this is just a heads up. hopefully tonight I'll have time to dig deeper into the problem.
