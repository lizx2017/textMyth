Summary:
LineSeries has potential nullpointer exception
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Load a chart with a Line Series.
2. Unload a compiled stylesheet, and load a new compiled style sheet which does not defines "fills"
3. Reload a chart which has Line Series.
Actual Results:
Nullpointer at line 975 in LineSeries.as
Expected Results:
no runtime error.
Workaround (if any):
none.
My only solution is to copy the source code and modify function stylesinitialized as follows.
override public function stylesInitialized():void
{
_localFills = getStyle('fills');
if ( _localFills != null )
_fillCount = _localFills.length;
else
_fillCount = 0;
super.stylesInitialized();
override public function styleChanged(styleProp:String):void
{ requires the same fix. }
