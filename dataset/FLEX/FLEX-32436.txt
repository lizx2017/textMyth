Summary:
ChartLabel can throw null reference exception
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
N / A - unfortunately, I have no clear steps to reproduce. I tried to create a simple test case, but could not get it to fail. However, it's obvious through inspection that the code can do the wrong thing in some situations.
Here is the stack trace I get:
TypeError: Error #1009: Cannot access a property or method of a null object reference.

Line 262 in ChartLabel is the following:
if(parent.rotation == 90 && parent is AxisRenderer)
which means that when parent is null (such as when the ChartLabel has been taken off the display list?), we'll get an error.
Actual Results:
Null reference error thrown by callLater
Expected Results:
No error
Workaround (if any):
Have the AxisRenderer set the titleRenderer to use a factory that returns a custom descendent of ChartLabel that checks for a non-null parent in the updateDisplayList before() doing anything.
Attached is a proposed fix.
