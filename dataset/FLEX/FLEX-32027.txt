Summary:
Certain draggability settings in the ADG set up the header to act as a row of data. Dragging and clicking it produce events as if you had clicked or drug an element of the data in the grid.
Description:
I wasn't sure what to use for the Version/Build number. It's Flex Beta 3 - Milestone 4 in any case.
Steps to reproduce:
ADG implementation:
<mx:AdvancedDataGrid id="dgPagesAndCats" folderClosedIcon="
{this.imgFolderIcon}" folderOpenIcon="{this.imgFolderIcon}
" dataProvider="
{new HierarchicalData(this.arrPagesAndCats)}
" dragEnabled="true" doubleClickEnabled="true" dragMoveEnabled="true" dropEnabled="true" allowMultipleSelection="true" width="100%" height="100%" borderColor="#CCCCCC" sortableColumns="false" resizableColumns="false" draggableColumns="false">
Event listeners on the ADG:
this.dgPagesAndCats.addEventListener(DragEvent.DRAG_DROP, dragDropPageCat);
this.dgPagesAndCats.addEventListener(DragEvent.DRAG_COMPLETE, dragCompletePageCat);
this.dgPagesAndCats.addEventListener(MouseEvent.CLICK, setPagesState);
this.dgPagesAndCats.addEventListener(MouseEvent.DOUBLE_CLICK, editSelectedItem);
Actual Results:
All these events can be kicked off by dragging/clicking/double-clicking the header. If you drag the header into the datagrid it adds an item to the grid consisting of only the title of the header field that was drug.
If you're doing any analyzation and handling of the objects that were dragged or clicked it can (and probably will) cause a crash.
Expected Results:
The datagrid should just ignore clicks and drags of this type.
Workaround (if any):
I've added some code to do a little more detection on the item that was clicked to make sure it wasn't the header. If it was you have to cancel the original event which causes some visual issues after a drag.
