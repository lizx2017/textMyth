Summary:
Incorrect keyCode is dispatched when replaying textInput event on TextArea/TextField
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create an application with with a TextArea and add a handler for keyDown event.
2. Record and replay a textInput event with an automation tool.
3. During replaying TextFieldAutomationHelper::replayAutomatableEvent dispatches KEY_DOWN and KEY_UP KeyboardEvent to the target object.
4. keyCode property of KeyboardEvent is set equal to charCode. This is wrong thing to do for some characters, e.g. lower case letters.
Actual Results:
TextArea handler receives an event with incorrect keyCode property (always equal to charCode).
Expected Results:
TextArea handler must receive an event with correct keyCode property (e.g. for lower-case letter 'a', charCode is 97, keyCode is 65.
Workaround (if any):
None.
Additional information:
Guilty code is on line 336 and line 366 of TextFieldAutomationHelper.as in SDK 3.2. A mapping to charCodes to keyCodes is required here.
