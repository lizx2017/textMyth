Summary:
PieSeries.dataFunction doesn't allow to set nameField
Description:
Reproduced on Flex SDK 4.0.0.14159, Flash Player 11.0.1.152 & FF 7.0.1
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run the demo app attached
2. See that Legend is empty because no way to set PieSeries.nameField (and dataFunction works incorrectly) when dataProvider has complex non-list based structure
Actual Results:
Legend is empty (items with blank names)
PieSeries.dataFunction doesn't iterate over nameField thus doesn't allowing to set it when DP is complex
Can't set PieSeries.nameField using E4X either
Expected Results:
Legend should display item names
Either PieSeries.dataFunction should iterate over PieSeries.nameField or it should be possible to set it dirrectly using E4X
Workaround (if any):
No workaround found
P.S. Also found another bug in ColumnSeries.dataFunction (read comments in attached source)
