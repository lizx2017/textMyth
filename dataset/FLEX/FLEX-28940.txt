Summary:
using useVirtualLayout="true" seems to snap different elements on orientation change with paging mode
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Launch the attached app on a device
2. Scroll to last few images in landscape mode
3. Change to portrait
Actual Results:
1. Incorrect image gets snapped
2. Paging boundaries are not respected
Expected Results:
Same item is snapped and paging boundaries in new orientation is respected.
Workaround (if any):
Use the resize handler for the list to reset renderer which has the logic to bind the image dimensions eg.
<s:Image id="image" height="
{parentDocument.height}
" width="
{parentDocument.width}
" scaleMode="stretch" />
