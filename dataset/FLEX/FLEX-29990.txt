Summary:
Having a scroll on a Flex component will return only the visible items when try to get them onto an object
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Select either a FlexList / FlexComboBox / FlexTree within a FlexBox which limits the number of items shown, and requires to scroll to see all items
2. Create an object containing all the FlexTree items
e.g.: set objColumnList = Browser("title:=.*").FlexApplication("id:=ocoFlexPureMVCReports").FlexBox("automationname:=Edit Grid Options").FlexTree("automationname:=editColumnsTree").ChildObjects
3. Get the number of total items using the GetItemsCount method
AllTreeNodes = Browser("title:=.*").FlexApplication("id:=ocoFlexPureMVCReports").FlexBox("automationname:=Edit Grid Options").FlexTree("automationname:=editColumnsTree").GetItemsCount()
Actual Results:
'objColumnList.count' displays only the visible items (excluding the items hidden by the scroll)
'AllTreeNodes' shows the total items that are within the component (including items hidden by the scroll)
Expected Results:
Ideally 'objColumnList.count' and 'AllTreeNodes' numbers should match
Workaround (if any):
Due to the above cannot use the object created directly. Need to check if it contains all objects and if not go through scrolling until all objects are met, get them into arrays, ReDim them few times etc etc.
Need to write lines and lines of codes for somthing which should be very easy.
