Summary:
DataTips do not appear when horizontal axis direction is inverted
Description:
If you create a chart that uses the following as the Linear Axis, the datatips will not be rendered except for a single data tip at the middle of the chart.
If you change the direction of the axis to "normal" from "inverted", datatips will appear again.
I do not know of any workaround to this.
<mx:horizontalAxis>
<mx:LinearAxis id='MyCategoryAxis'
direction="inverted"
minimum="1" baseAtZero="true" interval="1"
displayName="
{HorizontalAxisDisplayName}"
title="{HorizontalAxisDisplayName}
"
padding="0.5"
/>
</mx:horizontalAxis>
