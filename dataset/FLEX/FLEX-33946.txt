Description:
There is an issue with the spark data grid when used with requestedMaxRowCount set to a value.
Issue:
If my requested max row count is 4 and I have 5 elements in the grid.
I select one of the rows and remove it from the grid .
By accessing the data provider.
This causes the grid to crash ..
Analysis :
This happens only when the number of elements the grid are n+1 when
requestedMaxRowCount = "n"
Work around :
Use the height property of the grid instead of requestedMaxRowCount.
Give it a set height .
