Description:
When I open a FlexTitleWindow that has a FlexTextArea that is just a line textbox and has the focus on it in default, and type something, "Input" method is not properly written in QTP.
Browser("xxx").FlexApplication("xxx").FlexTitleWindow("xxx").FlexTextArea("xxx").Input "test"
The line above should be generated but skipped.
After moving the focus to the other object and come it back on the textbox, it would be recoreded.
WorkAround:
manually setting focus on text area solves the issue. Manually setting focus adds following line before inputting text, after adding this line input is getting recorded correctly.
Browser("xxx").FlexApplication("xxx").FlexTitleWindow("xxx").FlexTextArea("xxx").SelectText 0,0
