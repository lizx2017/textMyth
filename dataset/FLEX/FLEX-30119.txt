Summary:
Object not found during replay
Description:
Hello,
I am currently evaluating QTP with the Flex pluging to analyse if it could be adopted in our company.
Description:
I have a strange behaviour when replying a QTP script recorded in the keyword editor.
During the recording all the objects were add correctly to the object repository. However, when I replay the script QTP gives me the following error:
"Failed to find object. Error 1502 "
The object is present in the Flex application with the same automationName as the one in the object repository. Using the highlight action from the repository cannot found the components either.
Could this be due to the fact he object is a custom component? Even if it is composed of native Flex components?
Should I use a solution as explained in this page: http://livedocs.adobe.com/flex/3/html/help.html?content=functest_components2_18.html ?
Actual Results: Replay cause error 1502, which stops the execution.
Expected Results: Component should be found to perform the recorded script.
Workaround (if any): -
