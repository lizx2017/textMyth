Summary:
Formatted data doesn't sort in DataGrid or ADG
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Compile the attached files and test separately.
2. The only difference between the two files is one (SortsDontWork.mxml) uses a CurrencyFormatter to format the numbers, the other just shows the raw numbers (SortsWork.mxml).
Actual Results:
Run each file separately and try sorting the columns of the AdvancedDataGrid. Any columns that use a formatter (including DateFormatter, CurrencyFormatter, etc.) do not sort.
Expected Results:
Columns using formatters should sort the same as unformatted data.
Workaround (if any):
Don't use a formatter on DataGrid or ADG data, or try to format on the back-end and use kludgey workarounds to ensure the data still sorts correctly in string form.
