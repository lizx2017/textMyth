Summary:
Resources - fallback not working when bundle of missing language doesn't exist
Description:
Hi,
I had the following problem.
1. localeChain["tr_TR", "en_US"];
2. resourceManager.getString("test", "test1");
3. bundle test was available in "de_DE" and "en_US" - no bundle (properties-File) for "tr_Tr"
-> Displayed was the "de_DE" - Version of the text ... Why not the "en_US" - version
IDE: Intellij Idea
-> locales clicked together (checkboxes) in the IDE de_DE, en_US, ...
Adding an empty properties-File for tr_TR and it is working as expected (Fallback on en_US).
Best regards,
Christian
