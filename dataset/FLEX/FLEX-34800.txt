Summary:
BusyIndicator duplicates, rotates around top-left instead of centre
Description:
Since the release of 4.14.0, the Spark BusyIndicator component does not rotate correctly: instead of rotating in a circle about its centre, the original image remains in place while another rotates jerkily anti-clockwise about the top left corner outside of the component.
