Summary:
Cannot install Apache Flex
Description:
We want to migrate an existing project from Flex 4.6 to Apache Flex. We are working on FlashBuilder 4.7.
All I need is to get a latest version of Apache Flex in my Flash Builder. I am Adobe Certified Flex Expert, used to work with different versions and was not expecting any problems. First of all, I just downloaded Flex SDK (like for Flex 4.6), but it was not recognized in Flash Builder as a complete SDK.
So, I started to investigate the issue. As recommended, I downloaded Flex Installer and was trying to install Flex on my machine, but it was not possible. Again and again it was aborting the installation giving the error: I spent a lot of time trying to install Apache Flex, but it was not possible.
This is the tipical Install log I would be getting again and again.
