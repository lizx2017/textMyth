Summary:
Spark Datagrid column resize and sort bug when releasing mouse outside of headers
Description:
Description
The 4.10 spark datagrid column resize and sort behavior changed from earlier releases, regarding interactions between mouse pointer and column header.
Steps to Reproduce
Problem #1:
Running the example code provided below, or using SDK 4.10 spark datagrid in your own application, left-click mouse on header column separator, and still holding down left-click button, drag mouse outside of header region, then release left-click button.
Problem #2:
Running the example code provided below, or using SDK 4.10 spark datagrid in your own application, left-click mouse on header column area to sort the column, and still holding down the left-click button, drag mouse outside of header region, then release left-click button.
Environment
Mac OSX 10.6.8, Apache Flex 4.10.0, Flash Builder 4.6 and 4.7
Expected Behavior
Problem 1:
The column should still be able to resize when the mouse cursor leaves the header region, as long as the left-click button remains down.
Also, the default mouse pointer icon should replace the resize mouse icon when the left-click button is released outside of the header region.
Problem 2:
The column header cell should return to its mouse-up color when the left-click button is released outside of the header region.
Actual Behavior
Problem #1:
Observe that the mouse cursor does not return to the usual pointer icon (the resize-column mouse icon remains displayed).
Also, observe that the column resize stops working when the mouse icon leaves the header region.
Problem #2:
Observe that the column header background color indicates mouse-down (even though the mouse left-click was released, albeit outside the header region).
