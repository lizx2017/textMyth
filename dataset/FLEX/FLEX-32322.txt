Summary:
AdvancedDataGridDragProxy calls groupLabelFunction with wrong parameters
Description:
Found in Flex SDK 3.1. Can someone please explain what each version in the bug tracker means and where I can find the right build number? Why can't I just select SKD 3.1? :-/
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a ADG with HierarchicalData and use a groupLabelFunction as described in the Flex help: myGroupLabelFunction(item:Object, column:AdvancedDataGridColumn):String
2. Enable drag & drop on the ADG
3. Try to drag a group in the ADG
Actual Results:
ArgumentError: Error #1063 --> AdvancedDataGridDragProxy.as:104
Expected Results:
Dragging should work, when the AdvancedDataGridDragProxy passes the column to the groupLabelFunction. Currently the parameter column is missing.
