Summary:
Release build does not work as described in README on OS X
Description:
I discovered a stumbling block when trying to setup an environment to develop a fix for FLEX-34634:
The README file in the root of flex-sdk states:
On Mac, set ADOBE_EXTENSION_MANAGER to the absolute path of "Adobe Extension Manager CS5.app"
This did not work for me. Ant complains that the variable has an incorrect value. I had to set it to /Applications/Adobe Extension Manager CS5/Adobe Extension Manager CS5.app/Contents/MacOS/Adobe Extension Manager CS5.
