Summary:
DataGrid ignors column formatters when sorting by simple fields
Description:
Steps to reproduce: run the attached project (the steps are on the stage).
Summary: when the user sorts by a column in a DataGrid which has a formatter (and no labelFunction), the sorting ignores the formatter and sorts instead by the original value of that field. This happens both for simple dataFields (e.g. "name") or complex ones (e.g. "address.street").
