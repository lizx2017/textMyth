Summary:
Wrong paths for video in TourDeFlex application
Description:
The VideoPlayer is that it is looking for the mp4 in the wrong place, or rather the correct place, but when a SWF is loaded by another SWF relative paths are fixed up against the first SWF loaded. The Spark video control doesn't fix the path like the MX video control does.
