Summary:
Legend doesn't update as chart.series changes
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a LineChart with four LineSeries.
2. Add a Legend to the application.
3. In ActionScript, remove one series from the chart (using pop(), for instance)
Actual Results:
The legend still shows all four series.
Expected Results:
I expected the legend to only display the three remaining series.
Workaround (if any):
Completely replacing the series array (chart.series = someOtherArray) seems to update the legend. However, completely replacing the series array means that I can't take advantage of series effects.
