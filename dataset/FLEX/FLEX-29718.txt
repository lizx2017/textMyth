Summary:
Escape characters in the 'restrict' attribute are not passed in to QTP
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. create flex app with TextInput or TextArea control
2. set textInput or textarea restrict property to allow reserved characters ('^', '-', '\'), with the preceding escape character (eg: '-^
')
3. Use QTP's 'Object Spy' to check the 'restrict' property (or read the GetROProperty("restrict") for the text input control through a QTP script)
Actual Results:
QTP sees the restrict property without the escape characters. (eg: '-^\')
Expected Results:
QTP should see the escape characters (eg: '-^
')
Workaround (if any):
NONE (in fact, this bug surfaced as I was looking for a workaround to FLEXENT-652)
