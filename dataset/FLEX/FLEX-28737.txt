Summary:
Running two ViewTransitions at the same time when one of the incoming views has StageText on it will cause the application to stall
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Install the SpViewNavTransitionTests.apk. It's too big to attach in JIRA, so you can get it from here:
\\fbapps.corp.adobe.com\rebecca\bin-debug
2. Launch the SpViewNavTransitionsTests on the device - let it run
OR
1. Import the attached FXP into FB
2. Attach an Android device to your machien
3. Run > Debug
Actual Results:
The application will stall when it attempts to push the SettingsView on the left (which has stage text), and the TileImageView on the right.
Expected Results:
Should continue to the next test and the app will eventually shut itself down
Workaround (if any):
none
Additional Info:
There is no RTE when run in the debugger
The test was built with SDK 4.6.0.22883 and run with today's runtime 3.1.0.465. It also reproduces with the yesterday's runtime 3.1.0.464 with which we had the last successful run.
