Summary:
horizontalShowOrigin behaves oddly in CSS Design View preview
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a CSS file with a LineChart{} style rule and select this rule in CSS Design View
2. Press the Edit button next to "Grid lines"
3. Refresh DV and then repeat step 2 (this is necessary to work around FLEXDMV-1173)
4. Uncheck "Horizontal origin"
5. Change "Direction" to "vertical"
6. Re-check "Horizontal origin"
Actual Results:
4. No change
6. Blue horizontal line at bottom becomes 2px thick, only on the left half of its length
Expected Results:
4. Shouldn't the horizontal blue line at bottom disappear or change to white?
6. Either the entire line should become 2px thick (still seems a bit weird), or no change?
Workaround (if any):
None.
