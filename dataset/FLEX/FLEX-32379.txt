Summary:
AdvancedDataGrid doesn't render at all in Flex 4 SDK?
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Try to run the very simple attached code which has an AdvancedDataGrid with a dataProvider specified as a bindable ArrayCollection
Actual Results:
Nothing gets rendered on the resulting swf.
Expected Results:
AdvancedDataGrid should be rendered with two sortable columns.
Notes:
I have copied the following two swc files to make the code compile, as explained in another posting:
1. <flexdir>/sdks/3.1.0/frameworks/libs/datavisualization.swc copied to <flexdir>/sdks/4.0.0.4270/frameworks/libs/datavisualization.swc
2. <flexdir>/sdks/3.1.0/frameworks/locale/en_US/datavisualization_rb.swc copied to <flexdir>/sdks/4.0.0.4270/frameworks/locale/en_US/datavisualization_rb.swc
The flex compiler in my Flex Builder is set to Flex SDK 4.0.0.4270. The target flash player in my project settings is set to 10.0.0 and I have Flash version 10,0,12,36 installed.
