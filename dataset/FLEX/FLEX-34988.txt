Summary:
Number of characters with images is wrong
Description:
Hi, I have a problem when I insert images in the text. When I get the text of the TLF the number of characters is wrong. It only counts the images that are displayed.
I build a test code to see the problem.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I added 3 images, but getText() function only returns the last one.
NOTE_1: If you uncomment [oController.verticalScrollPosition = 0;] line after adding the 3rd image, it returns the first two images.
So, it seems getText() function only returns the images that have appeared on screen.
NOTE_2: On the other hand, as you can see in the example, the [textLength] attribute returns one more character than [getText().length].
