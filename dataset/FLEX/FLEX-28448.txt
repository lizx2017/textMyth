Summary:
Callout doesn't get positioned based on the updated layout which shows only the second view navigator
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Put SplitViewNavigator.
2. Add two ViewNavigators as children.
3. Add a Button to the View in the second ViewNavigator and hook "showFirstViewNavigatorInCallout" method to its click event. Set the Button as the callout owner.
4. Run the app. Click the button to open the callout.
Actual Results: The callout appears at the position where the Button used to show. The Button has shifted to left together with the second view navigator.
Expected Results: When the callout is opened, its position is calculated by the new position of the second view navigator.
