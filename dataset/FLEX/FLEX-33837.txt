Summary:
Compiler assumes that there will be a file for each goog.require
Description:
It seems like FlexJS compiler assumes that there will be a file for each goog.require dependency, while closure allows multiple classes to be declared in the same .js file.
Some of the closure internal classes use the same construct & its impossible to compile them currently using FlexJS
E.g. goog.events.BrowserEvent.MouseButton is defined in goog/events/browserevent.js & referenced by goog.fx.dragger compiling this with FlexJS results in this error
java.io.FileNotFoundException:
