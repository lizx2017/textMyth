Summary:
Flex compiled with Flex SDK 3.2.0 QTP libs disables the chart drilling ability
Description:
Environment:
Flex Builder 3 with SDK 3.2.0
QTP 9.2
Windows XP
Steps to reproduce:
1.Build the flex code with QTP libs available with Flex SDK 3.2.0 (include the lib references on Additional Compiler Arguments)
2.Open the application and select a report which has charts configured.
3.Click on the chart to drill on different data levels.
Actual Results:Cannot drill on charts
Expected Result:User should be able to drill on charts
Workaround (if any):This is not a workaround, however if you compile the Flex application without the QTP libs this issues does not appear.
However if we do not compile with the QTP libs we cannot test our application with automated test scripts.
