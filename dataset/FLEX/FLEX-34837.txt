Summary:
DataGrid sorted with complex dataField doesn't keep track of changes to those fields, leading to RTE when trying to remove selected item
Description:
Steps to reproduce: run attached application (steps are on the stage).
Note that GridItemEditor.save() has a trick to re-run the sort, but a custom grid editor or a programmatic change will not do that trick, leading to the RTE.
Another summary for this issue could be ListCollectionView doesn't keep track of changes to the complex fields it's being sorted by.
