Summary:
CLONE -Views with charts not getting GC-ed
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
Attached is a Flex project that has 0 lines of our project code. This project has the very same garbage collection issue that I reported earlier.
There are 3 views in the application: initial view and two subsequent views (one with chart, another one without chart). The view without chart gets garbage collected, the view with chart does not. From the home view click "Chart">"Back" and see memory allocation and compare to "No Chart">"Back".
