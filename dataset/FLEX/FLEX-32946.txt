Summary:
Chart Points not calculated/rendered correctly in Stacked Chart
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run the attached code for Flex 3.5 and Flex 4.
2. See the difference how it displays the '0' for Expenses stacked on the previous AreaSeries in case of multiple AreaSeries on AreaChart.
3. This is regression from 3.5 t0 4.1
Actual Results:
Stacked Charts are not displayed correctly as per documentation as multiple series are not stacked cumulative of top of each other. Rather they are taking axes as base for every series which is wrong.
Expected Results:
Stacked Charts should behave as documented behavior.
Attached images would show the difference. Even 100% type charts show this issue as Regression.
