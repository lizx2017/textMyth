Summary:
DataGrid drag/drop automation is not working correctly in AIR applications
Description:
Two problems: A - double dragStart events are recorded, B - drag/drop playback has no effect.
(Exact same non-AIR application works fine, also attached to this task).
Steps to reproduce for A:
1. Open attached AirDG.rtp project (Download RIATest from http://riatest.com/products/download.html)
2. Click Launch and wait for AIR application to open
3. Click Record
4. Drag/drop first item from left DataGrid to right DataGrid.
5. Notice recorded actions contain two dragStart events and one dragDrop
6. Close RIATest without saving the script (to preserve it for test case B below).
Actual Results:
Two dragStart events are recorded.
Expected Results:
One dragStart event is recorded.
Steps to reproduce for B:
1. Open attached AirDG.rtp project (Download RIATest from http://riatest.com/products/download.html)
2. Click Run
3. dragStart event has no effect.
4. dragStop event fails with error #1009 (fails at DragManagerAutomationImpl.as, line 436 because DragManager.dragProxy is null).
Actual Results:
Drag/drop sequence fails.
Expected Results:
Drag/drop sequence works.
