Summary:
AdvancedDataGrid Columnwidth not under control, The last column is larger than others
Description:
I have a advanceddatagrid with two columns which have a width of absolute values and the others are not set.
My datagrid has a width of 100%, when i render the datagrid the absolute values are rendering nicely but the the last column is larger than the other columns.
[width10] [width 50][width -][width -][width - (but larger then the other 2)]
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a advanceddatagrid
2. Create 4 Columns with width set to an absolute value
3. Create 4 Columns with width not set
Actual Results:
Last Column width, which was not set, is larger then the other three columns, which are also not have a absolute width.
Expected Results:
All 4 Columns, which have no absolute width, have the same width!
