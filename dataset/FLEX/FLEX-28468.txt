Summary:
TextArea text disappears if border is not visible and either heightInLines or widthInChars = NaN
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. define a TextArea with borderVisible="false"
2. set either the heightInLines to NaN or the widthInChars to NaN (or both)
3. assign enough text to the TextArea to force it to wrap to two or more lines.
4. set a background color so that the shape of the TextArea is obvious.
Actual Results:
The shape of the TextArea is correct, based on the text contents, but the contents are not visible.
Expected Results:
As above, but with the text showing.
Workaround (if any):
Set border color to match background color of containing component. Skin the TextArea to suppress the shadow.
