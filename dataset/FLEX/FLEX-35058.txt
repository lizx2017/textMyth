Summary:
Flex JS LICENCE and NOTICE doesn't follow ASF policy
Description:
Note also effects Flex JS 0.6.
Binary file has a few issues:
Could have Apache licensed Google Caja project [1][2][3] While not required by current policy it seem odd to mention one 3rd party Apache licence software in LICENSE but not another.
Contains code from Apache Shindig [4], this has a NOTICE file [5] which would likely effect our binary NOTICE file.
This file [6] is based on BSD license code [7] This should be mentioned in LICENSE
This file [8] contains code from http://www.json.org/json2.js which is public domain which should be mentioned in LICENSE.
This file [9] contains code from http://webfx.eae.net/dhtml/slider/js/range.js which is Apache licensed and should be mention in LICENSE if other 3rd party Apache licensed files are.
The BSD licensed file [10] contains code from http://www.bytestrom.eu/blog/2009/1120a_jpeg_encoder_for_javascript (unknown license). We need to work out what the original license was and if it's Apache compatable.
