Summary:
CLONE -Flex LineChart incorrectly clips data
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
Create LineChart with the following data set
X | Y
1 | 10
2 | -10
3 | 10
Graph it and you will see a V shaped line (This is correct)
Now set the Y axis to minimum=0.
At this point nothing will be drawn (empty chart)
The reason for this is that -10 is less then zero and the chart ignores the value. Since -10 is missing no line gets drawn from 1,10 to 2,-10 and you see nothing.
I would expect to see a clipped V shaped graph with the portion bellow zero simply not visible.
