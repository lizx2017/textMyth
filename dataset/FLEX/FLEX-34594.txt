Summary:
MouseEventUtil.createMouseWheelChangingEvent() does not copy event.commandKey and event.controlKey
Description:
MouseEventUtil.createMouseWheelChangingEvent() does not copy the commandKey and controlKey properties of the underlying MouseEvent.MOUSE_WHEEL from which the corresponding FlexMouseEvent.MOUSE_WHEEL_CHANGING event is created. As a consequence, one cannot evaluate the status of the Cmd key on Mac when the MOUSE_WHEEL_CHANGING event is handled.
Probably easy to fix as FlexMouseEvent inherits from MouseEvent so it should also have a commandKey and a controlKey property.
