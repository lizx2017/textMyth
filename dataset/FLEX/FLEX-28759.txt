Summary:
TextInput under Callout doesn't react to touch the same as TextInput outside of open Callout
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a mobile application with the following body:
<s:CalloutButton label="display callout" >
<s:calloutLayout>
<s:VerticalLayout paddingLeft="10" paddingRight="10" paddingTop="10" paddingBottom="10"
gap="10" horizontalAlign="justify"/>
</s:calloutLayout>
<s:Button />
<s:TextInput width="50"/>
</s:CalloutButton>
<s:TextInput height="100" width="100"/>
<s:TextInput />
<s:TextInput />
<s:TextInput />
<s:TextInput />
<s:TextInput />
<s:TextInput />
2. Launch the app, click on the CalloutButton to open the Callout
3. Click on a TextInput that is overlaid by the CalloutButton
4. Re-open the Callout
5. Click on a TextInput that is not overlaid by the CalloutButton
Actual Results:
Clicking on the TextInput that is underneath the Callout closes the Callout but does not activate the soft keyboard or put focus in the TextInput.
Clicking on the TextInput that is outside of the Callout does not close the Callout (noted in SDK_31638 but does open the soft keyboard and put focus in the TextInput.
Expected Results:
Desired behavior is that the Callout will close but the TextInput does not gain focus and the soft keyboard does not activate.
Workaround (if any):
None
Additional notes:
If the desired behavior ends up being to activate the TextInput's focus and softkeyboard, this problem probably exists for any popup or component overlaying a TextInput (where the StageText <-> bitmap swap code is coming into play). If, however, we look at this as a situation where the StageText needs to handle "click in which is closing a popup" specially, we should be able to isolate this fix to just the text component.
