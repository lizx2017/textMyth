2. Use a HierarchicalData from an XML file as the dataProvider for the ADG.
3. Expand all nodes using the expandAll() method.
4. Scroll through the ADG.
5. Attempt to collapse all nodes using the collapseAll() method.
Actual Results:
The records that were displayed before initiating the collapseAll() method are still displayed in the ADG.
