Summary:
AdvancedDataGrid/MXAdvancedDataGridItemRenderer does not seem to properly update listData with item state.
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1.Create an ADG using an MXAdvancedDataGridItemRenderer component for one of the columns.
2. Load the ADG with data.
3. Attempt to use the "open", and "hasChildren" properties of listData.
4. Note that this attempt to use listData is used in the "dataChange" handler for the itemRenderer.
Actual Results:
These all come back false, regardless of how the data is structured.
Expected Results:
For objects with children, "hasChildren" should be true.
For objects where the item is "open", i.e. displaying children, open should be true.
Workaround (if any):
None that I could find.
