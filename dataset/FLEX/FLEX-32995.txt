Summary:
HierarchicalCollectionView currentLength calculation bug
Description:
When dragging an item in an ADG which uses a HierarchicalCollectionView instance as the data-provider my application caused a RTE.
I found out it originates from my application reacting to a collection event before the HierarchicalCollectionView instance does. By setting the openNodes property on the HierarchicalCollectionView (in my event handler), the currentLength is updated, and when the HierarchicalCollectionView instance reacts to the event, it adds +1 to the length for the ADD event.
Hence the length has increased by two, which is wrong and causes a RTE when accessing a non existing item.
I am using SDK 3.6. that comes with FB 4.5
