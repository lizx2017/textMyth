Summary:
Sub applications which load swfs of their own cannot have paths from the top level app that require encoding.
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a AIR project which loads a sub application with the following code: swfLoader.load("my folder/SubApplication.swf"); (Note the space in the path.)
2. From the sub application load another sub application swf
Actual Results:
Only the first level sub application is loaded.
Expected Results:
The sub application and the sub sub application would be loaded
Workaround (if any):
Don't include a space in the path to the sub application.
Source:
The issue appears to be a result of line 131 in mx.utils.LoaderUtil:
if (isMac())
return encodeURI(url);
As a result, the same problem does not occur on Windows.
