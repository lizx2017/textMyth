Summary:
HierarchicalCollectionView loses type information when serializing/deserializing
Description:
Found on Latest production version of Flex 3.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create new HierarchicalCollectionView
2. Create a copy using ObjectUtil.copy
Actual Results:
I don't get a copy correctly typed.
Expected Results:
I expected to get a copy correctly typed just like ArrayCollection.
Workaround (if any):
An easy workaround was to subclass HierarchicalCollectionView and add [RemoteClass(alias="whatever")] and then user registerClassAlias in your app for the (de)serialization to work correctly.
