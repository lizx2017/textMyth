Summary:
[FlexJS] IUIBase.topMostEventDispatcher not a MouseEventConverter Client
Description:
In flash, when opening a DropDownList and clicking outside the dropdown the following error occurs:
TypeError: Error #1034: Type Coercion failed: cannot convert flash.events::MouseEvent@709a5d9 to org.apache.flex.events.MouseEvent.
This is because of this line in DropDownListController:
IUIBase(_strand).topMostEventDispatcher.addEventListener(org.apache.flex.events.MouseEvent.CLICK, dismissHandler);
topMostEventDispatcher is the stage which does not call MouseEventConverter.setupInstanceConverters.
Perhaps the topmost event dispatcher should be the flexjs app instead?
