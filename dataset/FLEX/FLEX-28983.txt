Summary:
[ios] as3crypto lib (bytearray code in it) throws error when compiling with ipa-xxx different options but not when compiling with ipa-test-interpreter or ipa-debug-interpreter
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. try using airxmail with as3cryptolib and compiling with any option different than ipa-test-interpreter or ipa-debug-interpreter
2. running the example will throw a run-time error
Actual Results:
Error is thrown: no property -1 on ByteArray in RSAKey.as
Expected Results:
No error
Workaround (if any):
I am aware it is a third party lib, but behaviour is such that it is a compiler bug (should be operating the same but with performance difference only according to docs) . I will be submitting additional separate test without the lib. My guess is ByteArray behaviour is different for different compile parameters. bug appears with air sdk 3.0 and 3.1 compiled via commandline
