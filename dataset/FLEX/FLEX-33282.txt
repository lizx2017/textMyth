Summary:
Performance issue with multiple item renderers
Description:
The problem is that the ItemRenderer's prepare is called for every visible ItemRenderer when the mouse is moved over the grid and when starting and finishing item editing. Of course that prepare function should be called when the renderers are first brought to stage at the initialization and when you scroll up or down outside the screen when the renderers are recycled.
We are using datasets that well fit the screen with multiple columns so this can really make the program a little sluggish to use. When starting to edit there's easily a second or two delay before editor appears, after the indicator catches up with the mouse.
