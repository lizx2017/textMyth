Summary:
RTE when a chart has only 1 horizontal axis label and chart starts hidden
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create an application with a ColumnChart and dataProvider with only 1 item
2. Start the ColumnChart with visible and includeInLayout set to false
3. Run the application
Actual Results:
RTE at E:\dev\4.0.0\frameworks\projects\datavisualization\src\mx\charts\AxisRenderer.as:2513
Just above this line, there is a hard-coded reference (lastLabel = _labels[1]. Because there is only 1 item in the dataProvider, _labels[1] returns null, which causes the RTE in the code at line 2513.
Expected Results:
No RTE. Could either add code to make sure lastLabel isn't null prior to using it, or use (lastLabel = _labels[(_labels.length > 0) ? 1 : 0] to set the lastLabel value maybe.
Workaround (if any):
Works fine if the ColumnChart is visible initially.
