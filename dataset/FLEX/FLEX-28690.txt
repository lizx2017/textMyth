Summary:
List scroll position may be set incorrectly when using item snapping and loading data asynchronously
Description:
I haven't been able to construct a simple case for this, but we do have a project where it occurs intermittently.
1. Load the Abacus project from depot/flex/flex_apps and enable item snapping for this list in HeaderBar.mxml (we removed item snapping in CL323416 to fix this in our project).
2. Run on Tablet
3. Click on a category, such as Flex in the app and then click on the circle with arrow to go to that category's view
4. Click on the dropdown list in the actionbar and scroll
Result: The list won't scroll to the bottom items (though you can pull to see them). If no repro, try again with a different category.
