Summary:
DateTimeAxis reports maximum as 12 hours greater than actual set maximum
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run attached code and see debug output in TextArea
Actual Results:
In one of the lines, hAxis maximum will be reported as now plus 12 hours.
Expected Results:
hAxis maximum should always be reported as now (or now plus a few seconds).
Workaround (if any):
Don't set DateTimeAxis minimum or maximum manually.
NOTE: The same problem exists with minimum - under the same conditions it is reported as 12 hours EARLIER than it should be.
