Summary:
BusyIndicator very power consuming
Description:
Due to some hack fixing another problem, the state is always rotatingState which makes the component rotate behind the scenes when used in non-modal popups. Bad for power consumption on mobile devices!
See BusyIndicator.as:computeEffectiveVisibility().
// Treat all pop ups as if they were visible. This is to
// fix a bug where the BusyIndicator does not spin when it
// is inside modal popup. The problem is in we do not get
// an event when the modal window is made visible in
// PopUpManagerImpl.fadeInEffectEndHandler(). When the modal
// window is made visible, setVisible() is passed "true" so
// as to not send an event. When do get events when the
// non-modal windows are popped up. Only modal windows are
// a problem.
// The downside of this fix is BusyIndicator components that are
// inside of hidden, non-modal, popup windows will paint themselves
// on a timer.
