Summary:
mx:NumericStepper copy paste issue
Description:
I have two mx:NumericStepper in my project. I try to copy and past a value as 0.4 from the first numeric stepper into the second.
Graphically, before focus out fix all, I have this behaviour, in the second numeric stepper I have 00.40.4
Steps to Reproduce:
I've created this AIR project:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<s:WindowedApplication xmlns:fx="http://ns.adobe.com/mxml/2009"
xmlns:s="library://ns.adobe.com/flex/spark"
xmlns:mx="library://ns.adobe.com/flex/mx">
<mx:HBox width="100%">
<mx:NumericStepper id="myNS1" stepSize=".01" width="100"/>
<mx:NumericStepper id="myNS2" stepSize=".01" width="100"/>
</mx:HBox>
</s:WindowedApplication>
When the project starts:
1. I'm writing in the first numeric stepper the value 0.4
2. I'm pressing CTRL+A to select all and CTRL + C to copy the value 0.4
3. I'm focusing on the second numeric stepper and I'm pressing CTRL + V to paste the value at step 2.
4. The graphical output is 00.40.4
5. If I'm focusing out from the second numeric stepper, the result becomes 0.4 (correctly)
