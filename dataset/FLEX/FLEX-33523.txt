Summary:
MultiDPIBitmapSource is not behaving properly when fillMode = repeat
Description:
Hi there,
I'm developing a learning mobile app for children using Apache Flex and so far it is going great. Performance is good too. I didnt just learn a lot, but i also discovered many problem, one of them is v important and i'd appreciate if you guys take a look into it and fix it.
Problem is related to MultiDPIBitmapSource. It is working fine , however when i pass MultiDPIBitmapSource to a bitmapImage/Image controls with fillMode = repeat, it scales the image twice (instead of just replacing the image with appropriate dpi which is a usual case)
To generate the bug, simply pass a MultiDPIBitmapSource to any image control with fillmode = repeat,
Waiting for reply, Thanks
