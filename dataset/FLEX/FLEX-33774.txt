Summary:
grid.anchorRowIndex is reset to 0 when selection is programatically set (breaking further selection extend operations, e.g. SHIFT+CLICK)
Description:
When the selectedItems are programatically set on a DataGrid instance, the internal grid.anchorRowIndex is incorrectly reset to 0, even if displayed selection feedback is correct. When extending selection with SHIFT+CLICK on other rows, this incorrect value is computed and the new selection always starts from the first row.
