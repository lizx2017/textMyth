Summary:
Watermark prevents blocks mouse events and interaction with control underneath the watermark
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Import, compile and run attached Flex project (make sure you dont have a serial and the watermark is visible).
2. Grab the vertical scrollbar thumb in the DataGrid control
Actual Results:
You cant grab the scrollbar thumb (note that the skin doesnt even change to the "over" skin)
DataGrid rows arent highlighting if you are over/near the watermark.

The watermark should be visible, but not prevent a person from using the chart/Flex app.
