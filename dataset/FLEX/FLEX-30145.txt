Summary:
RTE in AutomationManager if an IAutomationObject is not also IUIComponent
Description:
1.) Launch app "RTE_NonIUIComponent_AutomationObject" with automation agent (so that you can record)
2.) Start recording.
3.) Click on the text.
Result:
RTE will occur in AutomationManager::getParent() because it assumes
IAutomationObject is IUIComponent.
Note:
This assumption is likewise present in various other places in AutomationManager.
