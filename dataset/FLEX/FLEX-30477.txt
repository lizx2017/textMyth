Summary:
Loading locale at runtime is not working when loading the main application with runtimeloading.swf for automation testing. It's happening for flash player version 10.3.183.5 and above.
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1.Create sample project and load the locale at runtime by passing the value through flashvars
like
var flashvars = {};
flashvars.resourceModuleURLs = "Resources_en_US.swf";
flashvars.localeChain = "en_US";
2.Load the above sample project within runtimeloading.swf for automation tesing by passing the value through flashvars like
flashvars.resourceModuleURLs = "Resources_"browserLocale".swf";
flashvars.localeChain = browserLocale;
var automationURL = "automationswfurl=FlexAutomation.swf?resourceModuleURLs=Resources_"browserLocale".swf&localeChain="+browserLocale;
Actual Results:Not seeing any locale when the file loaded within runtimeloading.swf for automation testing
Expected Results:Need to see all locale
Workaround (if any):Use flash player version lesser than 10.3.183.5
