Summary:
RTE in List automation if itemRenderer is not IAutomationObject
Description:
Steps to Reproduce:
1.) Launch app "RTE_Automation_ItemRenderer" with automation agent (so that you can record)
2.) Start recording.
3.) Scroll scrollbar in cstmIRList.
Result:
RTE will occur in ListBaseAutomationImpl::childAddedHandler() because it assumes
IListItemRenderer will have property "showInAutomationHierarchy." ie: Assumes IListItemRenderer
is also IAutomationObject.
Solution:
Do a weak cast to IAutomationObject and verify that item is of type IAutomationObject.
Note:
This assumption is likewise present in various ListBase classes' automation functionality.
Ex: ListBaseAutomationImpl::numAutomationChildren assumes all items in "listItems" are
automationChildren, i.e., that they implement IAutomationObject.
Assumptions are likewise present in:
DataGridAutomationImpl::numAutomationChildren
ListTabularData::getAutomationValueForData
DataGridTabularData::getAutomationValueForData
