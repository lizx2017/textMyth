Summary:
DataTipFunction not working sometimes for line series
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run a.mxml
2. It uses the data.xml file as data for the linechart
3. Put the mouse on the lines. on some lines the dataTip will be shown. on others, the datatip will not be shown....
Also when implementing my own dataTipFunction, during debug, the function is not triggered
Actual Results:
Not all data function works (it seems that the event is not triggered on several lines)
Expected Results:
Moving mouse on all the lines will trigger the data function creation
