Summary:
AdvancedDataGrid - Recording a "select" action on a cell with a RendererProvider as the content holder causes an AS error
Description:
Note: My build number is - 189825
Steps to reproduce:
1. Open attached ZIP with the SWF inside. (This has automation libraries already compiled in.)
2. Start recording with QTP and click on the Subtotal cells on the last row. Upon clicking an AS error should occur - here are the results below.
AS Error is attached as a JPG - grabbed it as a screen shot.
Workaround (if any):
Rani Kumar has been working with me on this and he sent me a file to add into the "-includes" while I compile. I've attached the file to the JIRA. Here is the text of the email he sent me:
For the time being, a half done solution can be achieved by including the attached file (add the file in the src folder of the flex builder project) . Using this you can get the recording of the click on that line and add checkpoints on that line. However this is not complete solution.
i.e. for the time being, include this delegate using the -includes
-locale en_US -includes AdvancedListBaseContentHolderAutomationImpl -include-libraries "C:\Work\flex\sdk_3.0.0.256\frameworks\libs\automation.swc" "C:\Work\flex\sdk_3.0.0.256\frameworks\libs\automation_dmv.swc" "C:\Work\flex\sdk_3.0.0.256\frameworks\libs\automation_agent.swc" "C:\Work\flex\sdk_3.0.0.256\frameworks\libs\qtp.swc"
