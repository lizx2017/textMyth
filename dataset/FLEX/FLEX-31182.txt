Summary:
LockedColumnCount not working on inserting column groups on runtime.
Description:
Reproduction:
1. Compile and run the bugfile.
2. Insert column groups on runtime.
3.
Actual Results:
1. The lockedColumn boundary is not visible after inserting column group.
2. Furthur inserting columns and column groups renders horizontal scrolling non-functional as using the scroll doesnt make the view go beyond two column headers
Expected Results: lockedColumn boundary should be maintained and furthur introducing columns should not cause erroneous scrolling behaviour.
