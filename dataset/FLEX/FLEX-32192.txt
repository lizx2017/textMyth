Summary:
HierarchicalCollectionViewCursor.findAny() function only finds the searched element if it is in position 1
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a HierarchicalCollectionView hcv
2. Create a cursor with hcv.createCursor()
3. Search for an element that is not in the first position of the collection
Actual Results:
Element is not found
Expected Results:
Element should be found
Workaround (if any):
I think the problem is located at line 422 of HierarchicalCollectionView, in function findAny():
done = moveNext();
where the cursor goes to the next element of the collection, after comparing the previous one to the one we are looking for.
In my head, it should not be "done" if the cursor successfully moved to the next element; it should be "done" only if there are no more elements to compare with in the collection.
Therefore, I think that a possible workaround would be:
done = ! moveNext();
