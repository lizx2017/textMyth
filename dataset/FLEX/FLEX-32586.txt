Summary:
Labels for chart series is not displayed when fontWeight is set to bold, with EmbeddedFonts
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Import the given flex project.
2. Run the sample in the project with sdk=4.0.0.10118 and DMV=250660
Actual Results: We dont see any label for ColumnSeries, inspite of label being specified in the code. (refer to the screenshot "sdk_10118_DMV_250660.JPG")
Expected Results: We should see proper series labels as per the screenshot "sdk_9593_DMV_250660.JPG"
Few points to note:
1. When we run the same sample with the same DMV but old sdk ( i.e., sdk 9593 with DMV=250660), it works as expected.
2. Also, if we dont use the embedded fonts, it works fine.
3. If we delete fontWeight="bold" and fontStyle="italic" from code, things work fine.
4. Problem is when using embeddedFonts in conjuction with fontWeight or fontStyle
