Summary:
NativeDragManagerImpl prevents objects from being garbage collected.
Description:
The mx.managers.NativeDragManagerImpl class adds a reference to the target in the private _relatedObject property during a dragDrop event. It appears that it does this so that it can construct a dragComplete event with this property.
During dragComplete after the _relatedObject is passed to the event, the _relatedObject is never set to null.
This causes the view to remain in memory until another native drag occurs to push it out with another object. This may never occur preventing the views from being garbage collected.
