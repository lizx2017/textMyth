Summary:
[FLEX]Microphone echo cancelation for mobile device
Description:
While developing an application on flex now I have a few problem with Microphone.getEnhancedMicrophone function on android and, iOS devices.
I tried to use flex 4.15.0 with air SDK 22.0.
The problem follows.
...
var mic:Microphone = Microphone.getEnhancedMicrophone();
...
But return value of getEnhancedMicrophone() function is null.
I know that air SDK 22 supports AEC(Acoustic Echo Cancelation) on iOS and air SDK 23 beta supports AEC on android devices.
So I tested getEnhancedMicrophone functions on the flash mobile project and it is fine(not null), but on flex mobile project it is null.
So can anybody to answer what is that and the ways to solve it?
