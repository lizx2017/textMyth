Summary:
[FlexJS] Binding not works expectedly
Description:
[This issue also discussed at: http://apache-flex-users.2333346.n4.nabble.com/Binding-not-works-expectedly-td12171.html]
Version: Apache FlexJS 0.5.0
Output platform: HTML
IDE: Flash Builder 4.7, Moonshine
I am having trouble binding a ValueObject to UI elements (i.e. text input, label) which updates by DataGrid.selectedItem upon application State change - DataGrid and UI elements are exists in different States. Upon DataGrid.selectedItem, application change it's State, update the ValueObjects field which is binded to UI elements.
By saying that:
1. State A has DataGrid
2. State B has a ViewBase component (VB)
3. When clicked on DataGrid row it's change handler function called
5. In change handler function application first changed it's State to B - component 'VB' became visible. Then injects DataGrid.selectedItem to component 'VB's [Bindable]ValueObject property
7. Said ValueObject has it's own GET/SET method along with 'changed' event dispatcher
private var _selectedAgent:AgentChain; 
                        
[Bindable("selectedAgentChanged")] 
public function get selectedAgent():AgentChain 
{ 
        return _selectedAgent; 
} 
public function set selectedAgent(value:AgentChain):void 
{ 
        if (value != _selectedAgent) 
        { 
                _selectedAgent = value; 
                dispatchEvent(new Event("selectedAgentChanged")); 
        } 
}
8. Even application State changed and ValueObject's SET method called, it's bindable UI elements never updated. Note: This problem specifically in HTML output nor SWF.
I am attaching herewith a POC project to describe my problem - TestFlexJSTableForAlex.ZIP.
