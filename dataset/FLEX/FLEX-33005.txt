Summary:
HierarchicalCollectionView does not update indexes for internal arrays when object uid changes
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Configure Data Services with Parent/Child bidirectional association between two Managed classes
2. Set up an Advanced Data Grid to display the data using HierarchicalData object as data source.
3. Create Parent, Commit
4. Create a Child for the parent, with one more Child below
5. Add the first Child to the Parent children array
6. Expand the first Child in the Advanced Data Grid, to display the second Child, Commit
Actual Results:
The first Child node will close during ConcreteDataService.internalUpdateCache. Now the control doesn't know how many items are in the list. Drag and Drop operations that hover over the empty rows close to the bottom of the list will crash the Advanced Data Grid control. The internal arrays indexed by UID are now stale, and leak memory.
Expected Results:
No crash, leak or auto-closing tree nodes.
Workaround (if any):
None tested. Maybe one could avoid adding the records to the managed association collections on the client side at all, to prevent Advanced Data Grid from having knowledge about the temporary UIDs, and just refresh fill every time an inserted record happens?
