Summary:
changes to font rendering in 4.5 SDK
Description:
This is not a new issue but somehow it is being ignored.
http://bugs.adobe.com/jira/browse/SDK-30365
http://bugs.adobe.com/jira/browse/FP-6496
Steps to reproduce:
1. Compile a Flex project with 4.5 SDK
2. Compile the same project with 4.1 SDK
3. Compare the text in Spark components
Actual Results:
Text compiled with 4.5 SDK is blurry and lowercase letters are shorter. I have tried this with several different fonts including TTF and OpenType. Attached is an example with Arial TTF.
Expected Results:
Text is identical.
