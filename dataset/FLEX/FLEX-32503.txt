Summary:
In Advanced Data Grid when you make columns hidden and visible a few times, the width of some Columns Reduce automatically to a minimum width.
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1.Import the application attached and run it.
2.Toggle the check box in the application 5-10 times, some columns are hidden/unhidden
3.The width of some Columns Reduce automatically.
Actual Results: The width of some columns change randomly.
Expected Results: If the width of columns change, The change should be consistent.
Workaround (if any): set resizable="false" on the columns. This wrokaround may be rejected by the customers as this may not be in line with their Design.
Another workaround would be :
Save the default widths into var's then just reapply those width's on the toggle.
Please run apple-grid2.zip.
