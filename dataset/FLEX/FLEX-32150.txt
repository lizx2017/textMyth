Summary:
Setting background on AdvancedDataGridGroupItemRenderer breaks open/closing animations
Description:
To reproduce:
Set the opaqueBackground attribute of the AdvancedDataGridGroupItemRenderer and open or close groups. See attached example.
Actual Results:
During the animation, items are rendered at the wrong place: icons show up over other items, even over the table header and the labels aren't drawn at all...
Expected Results:
Correct animations. Not having the background drawn during animations would be acceptable; but it shouldn't go wrong as bad as it does now.
