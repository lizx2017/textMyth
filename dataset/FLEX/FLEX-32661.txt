Summary:
String Validator On TextInput ItemRenderer for AdavncedDataGrid Highlighting Issue
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Attached is a sample application. In this sample application i am having a advanced Data Grid with three columns. Now in the second Column there is an item Renderer BlahRenderer.as used which is extending TextInput.
Now on these TextInput there are string validators defined. If there is an invalid string the TextInput box will highlight. Everything is working fine functionally but when we see closely the left hand side borders for the TextInput are not seen and the focus which is drawn when there is an invalid string, it is extending on left hand side and crossing the borders for the columns.
2.Notice that In the first two rows there are no lines at all on the left hand side . Also there is a gap between the red outline and the border of the highlighted field.
3. I am attaching the Screenshot also for this issue.
Actual Results: The screenshot shows the actual result.
Expected Results:The focus and highlight must be limited to the column on which we are having the BlahRenderer.
The left hand side border for BlahRenderer must be seen.
