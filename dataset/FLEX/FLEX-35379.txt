Summary:
TextInput and Autocorrect on iOS
Description:
On an iPad, if I type "william" into a textInput, iOS will autocorrect it to have a capital W and will display "William".  But when I use the text property of the textInput as a value for a database query, the value that is entered into a table is "william" with a lowercase w even though "William" with a capital W is displayed. 
But if I use the shift key to create a capital letter and type in "William", "William" gets entered into my database.  So on iOS, the capitalization that happens with autocorrect does not appear to make its way down to the text property. 
I don't know what happens on Android as I have not tried it. 
For a skin, I am using the ScrollingStageTextInputSkin
