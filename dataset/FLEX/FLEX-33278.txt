Summary:
Ctrl+V doesn't work properly
Description:
The issue is present when user tries to paste text that starts with new line.
When maxChars variable is specified and user tries to paste with Ctrl+V text bigger than maxChars - component will cut of extra chars, but when user presses Ctrl+V one more time - text will be pasted again. So, in this situation length of component's inner text will be greater than specified maxChars variable.
