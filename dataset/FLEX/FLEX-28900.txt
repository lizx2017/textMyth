Summary:
SplitViewNavigatorSkin ignores the backgroundAlpha style
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
SplitViewNavigator's default skin always draws a background even if backgroundAlpha is 0. This prevents the component from being used with Stage3D without a custom skin.
Workaround (if any):
Reskin the navigator or override the updateDisplayList()
