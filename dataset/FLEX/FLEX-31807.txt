Summary:
Slicer Axis stops working after the user selects one of the elements and then again selecting the 'All' element in the drop down list
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Execute a demo (preferable the OlapDemo project which can be downloaded from the Adobe website) that has a slicer option that has a list of element attributes.
2. Slice it by selecting any of the selected element (For example, you can choose a particular store Number). This step works.
3. Slice it again by selecting the "ALL" option from the drop down option. This step works also.
4. Slice it again by selecting any of the selected element. It STOPS slicing the data. (cause you choose the 'ALL' option in Step 3.)
Actual Results:
It stops slicing once you select the All option.
Expected Results:
It should show the filtered or sliced data
