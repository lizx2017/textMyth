Summary:
Cross-Compile from AS to JS fails to generate "super" call.
Description:
Create a FlexJS project and create an MXML compile with a root tag of <basic:Container>. In the <fx:Script> section, override addedToParent(), making sure to call super.addedToParent().
Compile the project using FalconJX and examine the resulting .js file from your MXML component. Locate the addedToParent() call.
Rather than finding the base(this, 'addedToParent') call, there is only a semi-colon.
