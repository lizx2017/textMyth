Summary:
HierarchicalData does not dispatch data binding events when source is changed
Description:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create ADG using HierarchicalData as the data provider, with the HierarchicalData's source property bound to suitable source of data that supports binding.
<mx:AdvancedDataGrid .... args etc >
<mx:dataProvider>
<mx:HierarchicalData source="
{myData}
"/>
</mx:dataProvider>
</mx:AdvancedDataGrid>
2. Update the data source.
Actual Results:
Flex correcly binds the updated data into the HierarchicalData's source property. (You can put a breakpoint on HierachicalData set source() and see it happening.) BUT HierarchicalData does not fire any events to indicate to the ADG that its data has changed, so the ADG continues to display the old data.
Expected Results:
I'm not 100% sure what events the HierarchicalData should be firing, but suspect that COLLECTION_CHANGE would probably be suitable.
Workaround (if any):
Subclass HierarchicalData, override the set source() function and dispatach a COLLECTION_CHANGE RESET event when the source is updated.
